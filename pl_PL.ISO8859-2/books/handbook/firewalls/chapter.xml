    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Firewalls make it possible to filter
      incoming and outgoing traffic that flows through your system.
      A firewall can use one or more sets of <quote>rules</quote> to
      inspect the network packets as they come in or go out of your
      network connections and either allows the traffic through or
      blocks it.  The rules of a firewall can inspect one or more
      characteristics of the packets, including but not limited to the
      protocol type, the source or destination host address, and the
      source or destination port.</para>

    <para>Firewalls can greatly enhance the security of a host or a
      network.  They can be used to do one or more of
      the following things:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>To protect and insulate the applications, services and
	  machines of your internal network from unwanted traffic
	  coming in from the public Internet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To limit or disable access from hosts of the internal
	  network to services of the public Internet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To support network address translation
	  (<acronym>NAT</acronym>), which allows your internal network
	  to use private <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses and share a
	  single connection to the public Internet (either with a
	  single <acronym>IP</acronym> address or by a shared pool of
	  automatically assigned public addresses).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <title>Firewall Concepts</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>rulesets</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>There are two basic ways to create firewall rulesets:
      <quote>inclusive</quote> or <quote>exclusive</quote>.  An
      exclusive firewall allows all traffic through except for the
      traffic matching the ruleset.  An inclusive firewall does the
      reverse.  It only allows traffic matching the rules through and
      blocks everything else.</para>

    <para>Inclusive firewalls are generally safer than exclusive
      firewalls because they significantly reduce the risk of allowing
      unwanted traffic to pass through the firewall.</para>

    <para>Security can be tightened further using a <quote>stateful
	firewall</quote>.  With a stateful firewall the firewall keeps
      track of which connections are opened through the firewall and
      will only allow traffic through which either matches an existing
      connection or opens a new one.  The disadvantage of a stateful
      firewall is that it can be vulnerable to Denial of Service
      (<acronym>DoS</acronym>) attacks if a lot of new connections are
      opened very fast.  With most firewalls it is possible to use a
      combination of stateful and non-stateful behavior to make an
      optimal firewall for the site.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="firewalls-apps">
    <title>Firewall Packages</title>

    <para>&os; has three different firewall packages built
      into the base system.  They are: <emphasis>IPFILTER</emphasis>
      (also known as <acronym>IPF</acronym>),
      <emphasis>IPFIREWALL</emphasis> (also known as <acronym>IPFW</acronym>),
      and <emphasis>OpenBSD's PacketFilter</emphasis> (also known as
      <acronym>PF</acronym>).  &os; also has two built in packages for
      traffic shaping (basically controlling bandwidth usage):
      &man.altq.4; and &man.dummynet.4;.  Dummynet has traditionally been
      closely tied with <acronym>IPFW</acronym>, and
      <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> with
      <acronym>IPF</acronym>/<acronym>PF</acronym>.  IPF,
      IPFW, and PF all use rules to control the access of packets to and
      from your system, although they go about it different ways and
      have different rule syntaxes.</para>

    <para>The reason that &os; has multiple built in firewall packages
      is that different people have different requirements and
      preferences.  No single firewall package is the best.</para>

    <para>The author prefers IPFILTER because its stateful rules are
      much less complicated to use in a <acronym>NAT</acronym>
      environment and it has a built in ftp proxy that simplifies the
      rules to allow secure outbound FTP usage.</para>

    <para>Since all firewalls are based on inspecting the values of
      selected packet control fields, the creator of the firewall
      rulesets must have an understanding of how
      <acronym>TCP</acronym>/IP works, what the different values in
      the packet control fields are and how these values are used in a
      normal session conversation.  For a good explanation go to:

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>PF</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>As of July 2003 the OpenBSD firewall software application
      known as <acronym>PF</acronym> was ported to &os; and was made
      available in the &os; Ports Collection; the first release that
      contained <acronym>PF</acronym> as an integrated part of the
      base system was &os;&nbsp;5.3 in November 2004.
      <acronym>PF</acronym> is a complete, fully featured firewall
      that has optional support for <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> (Alternate
      Queuing).  <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> provides Quality of Service
      (<acronym>QoS</acronym>) bandwidth shaping that allows
      guaranteeing bandwidth to different services based on filtering
      rules.  The OpenBSD Project does an outstanding job of
      maintaining the PF User's Guide that it will not be made part of
      this handbook firewall section as that would just be duplicated
      effort.</para>

      <title>Enabling PF</title>

      <para>PF is included in the basic &os; install for versions newer
	than 5.3 as a separate run time loadable module.  The system
	will dynamically load the PF kernel loadable module when the
	rc.conf statement <literal>pf_enable="YES"</literal> is used.
	The loadable module was created with &man.pflog.4; logging
	enabled.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The module assumes the presence of <literal>options
	    INET</literal> and <literal>device bpf</literal>.  Unless
	  <literal>NOINET6</literal> for &os; prior to 6.0-RELEASE and
	  <literal>NO_INET6</literal> for later releases (for example in
	  &man.make.conf.5;) was defined during the build, it also
	  requires<literal>options INET6</literal>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Once the kernel module is loaded or the kernel is statically
	built with PF support, it is possible to enable or disable
	<application>pf</application> with the <command>pfctl</command>
	command.</para>

      <para>This example demonstrates how to enable
	<application>pf</application>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -e</userinput></screen>

      <para>The <command>pfctl</command> command provides a way to work
	with the <application>pf</application> firewall. It is a good
	idea to check the &man.pfctl.8; manual page to find out more
	information about using it.</para>

      <para>It is not a mandatory requirement that you enable PF by
	compiling the following options into the &os; kernel.  It is
	only presented here as background information.  Compiling PF
	into the kernel causes the loadable module to never be

      <para>Sample kernel config PF option statements are in the

	are reproduced here:</para>

      <programlisting>device pf
device pflog
device pfsync</programlisting>

      <para><literal>device pf</literal> enables support for the
	<quote>Packet Filter</quote> firewall.</para>

      <para><literal>device pflog</literal> enables the optional
	&man.pflog.4; pseudo network device which can be used to log
	traffic to a &man.bpf.4; descriptor.  The &man.pflogd.8; daemon
	can be used to store the logging information to disk.</para>

      <para><literal>device pfsync</literal> enables the optional
	&man.pfsync.4; pseudo network device that is used to monitor
	<quote>state changes</quote>.  As this is not part of the
	loadable module one has to build a custom kernel to use
	it.</para>

      <para>These settings will take effect only after you have built
	and installed a kernel with them set.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Available rc.conf Options</title>

      <para>You need the following statements in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to activate PF at boot
	time:</para>

      <programlisting>pf_enable="YES"                 # Enable PF (load module if required)
pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"         # rules definition file for pf
pf_flags=""                     # additional flags for pfctl startup
pflog_enable="YES"              # start pflogd(8)
pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog"  # where pflogd should store the logfile
pflog_flags=""                  # additional flags for pflogd startup</programlisting>

      <para>If you have a LAN behind this firewall and have to forward
	packets for the computers in the LAN or want to do NAT, you
	have to enable the following option as well:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"            # Enable as LAN gateway</programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling <acronym>ALTQ</acronym></title>

      <para><acronym>ALTQ</acronym> is only available by compiling the
	options into the &os; Kernel.  <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> is not
	supported by all of the available network card drivers.	 Please
	see the &man.altq.4; manual page for a list of drivers that are
	supported in your release of &os;.  The following options will
	enable <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> and add additional
	functionality.</para>

      <programlisting>options         ALTQ
options         ALTQ_CBQ        # Class Bases Queuing (CBQ)

options         ALTQ_PRIQ       # Priority Queuing (PRIQ)
options         ALTQ_NOPCC      # Required for SMP build</programlisting>

      <para><literal>options ALTQ</literal> enables the
	<acronym>ALTQ</acronym> framework.</para>

      <para><literal>options ALTQ_CBQ</literal> enables Class Based
	Queuing (<acronym>CBQ</acronym>).  <acronym>CBQ</acronym>
	allows you to divide a connection's bandwidth into different
	classes or queues to prioritize traffic based on filter
	rules.</para>

      <para><literal>options ALTQ_RED</literal> enables Random Early
	Detection (<acronym>RED</acronym>).  <acronym>RED</acronym> is
	used to avoid network congestion.  <acronym>RED</acronym> does
	this by measuring the length of the queue and comparing it to
	the minimum and maximum thresholds for the queue.  If the
	queue is over the maximum all new packets will be dropped.
	True to its name, <acronym>RED</acronym> drops packets from
	different connections randomly.</para>

      <para><literal>options ALTQ_RIO</literal> enables Random Early

      <para><literal>options ALTQ_PRIQ</literal> enables Priority

      <title>Creating Filtering Rules</title>

      <para>The Packet Filter reads its configuration rules from the
	&man.pf.conf.5; file and it modifies, drops or passes packets
	according to the rules or definitions specified there.  The &os;
	installation comes with a default
	<filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename> which contains useful examples
	and explanations.</para>

      <para>Although &os; has its own <filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename>
	the syntax is the same as one used in OpenBSD.  A great
	resource for configuring the <application>pf</application>
	firewall has been written by OpenBSD team and is available at
	<uri xlink:href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/</uri>.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>When browsing the pf user's guide, please keep in mind that
     different versions of &os; contain different versions of pf.  The
     <application>pf</application> firewall in &os; 5.X is at the level
     of OpenBSD version 3.5 and in &os; 6.X is at the level of OpenBSD
     version 3.7.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The &a.pf; is a good place to ask questions about
	configuring and running the <application>pf</application>
	firewall.  Do not forget to check the mailing list archives
	before asking questions.</para>

    <title>The IPFILTER (IPF) Firewall</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>IPFILTER</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <note>
      <para>This section is work in progress.  The contents might
	not be accurate at all times.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The author of IPFILTER is Darren Reed.  IPFILTER is not
      operating system dependent: it is an open source application and
      has been ported to &os;, NetBSD, OpenBSD, &sunos;, HP/UX, and
      &solaris; operating systems.  IPFILTER is actively being
      supported and maintained, with updated versions being released
      regularly.</para>

    <para>IPFILTER is based on a kernel-side firewall and
      <acronym>NAT</acronym> mechanism that can be controlled and
      monitored by userland interface programs.  The firewall rules can
      be set or deleted with the &man.ipf.8; utility.  The
      <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules can be set or deleted with the
      &man.ipnat.1; utility.  The &man.ipfstat.8; utility can print
      run-time statistics for the kernel parts of IPFILTER.  The
      &man.ipmon.8; program can log IPFILTER actions to the system log
      files.</para>

    <para>IPF was originally written using a rule processing logic of
      <quote>the last matching rule wins</quote> and used only
      stateless type of rules.  Over time IPF has been enhanced to
      include a <quote>quick</quote> option and a stateful <quote>keep
	state</quote> option which drastically modernized the rules
      processing logic.  IPF's official documentation covers the legacy
      rule coding parameters and the legacy rule file processing
      logic.  The modernized functions are only included as additional
      options, completely understating their benefits in producing a
      far superior secure firewall.</para>

    <para>The instructions contained in this section are based on
      using rules that contain the <quote>quick</quote> option and the
      stateful <quote>keep state</quote> option.  This is the basic
      framework for coding an inclusive firewall rule set.</para>

    <!-- XXX: something like this already in
	 <xref linkend="firewalls-concepts"/>
	 AND: the para below is repeated 3 times in this chapter-->

    <para>An inclusive firewall only allows packets matching the rules
      to pass through.  This way you can control what services can
      originate behind the firewall destined for the public Internet
      and also control the services which can originate from the
      public Internet accessing your private network.  Everything else
      is blocked and logged by default design.  Inclusive firewalls are
      much, much more secure than exclusive firewall rule sets and is
      the only rule set type covered herein.</para>

    <para>For detailed explanation of the legacy rules processing
      method see: <uri xlink:href="http://www.obfuscation.org/ipf/ipf-howto.html#TOC_1">http://www.obfuscation.org/ipf/ipf-howto.html#TOC_1</uri>

      <para>One of the most important functions of the

      </indexterm>

      <para>In order for <command>ipmon</command> to work properly, the
	kernel option IPFILTER_LOG must be turned on.  This command has
	two different modes that it can be used in.  Native mode is the
	default mode when you type the command on the command line
	without the <option>-D</option> flag.</para>

      <para>Daemon mode is for when you want to have a continuous
	system log file available so that you can review logging of
	past events.  This is how &os; and IPFILTER are configured to
	work together. &os; has a built in facility to automatically
	rotate system logs.  That is why outputting the log information
	to syslogd is better than the default of outputting to a
	regular file.  In the default <filename>rc.conf</filename> file
	you see the ipmon_flags statement uses the <option>-Ds</option>
	flags:</para>

      <programlisting>ipmon_flags="-Ds" # D = start as daemon
                  # s = log to syslog
                  # v = log tcp window, ack, seq
                  # n = map IP &amp; port to names</programlisting>

      <para>The benefits of logging are obvious.  It provides the
	ability to review, after the fact, information such as which
	packets had been dropped, what addresses they came from and
	where they were going.  These all give you a significant edge
	in tracking down attackers.</para>

      <para>Even with the logging facility enabled, IPF will not
	generate any rule logging on its own.  The firewall
	administrator decides what rules in the rule set he wants to
	log and adds the log keyword to those rules.  Normally only
	deny rules are logged.</para>

      <para>It is very customary to include a default deny everything
	rule with the log keyword included as your last rule in the
	rule set.  This way you get to see all the packets that did not
	match any of the rules in the rule set.</para>

      <title>IPMON Logging</title>

      <para><application>Syslogd</application> uses its own special
	method for segregation of log data.  It uses special groupings
	called <quote>facility</quote> and <quote>level</quote>.  IPMON
	in <option>-Ds</option> mode uses <literal>security</literal>
	as the <quote>facility</quote>
	name.  All IPMON logged data goes to <literal>security</literal>
	The following levels can be
	used to further segregate the logged data if desired:</para>

      <screen>LOG_INFO - packets logged using the "log" keyword as the action rather than pass or block.
LOG_NOTICE - packets logged which are also passed
LOG_WARNING - packets logged which are also blocked
LOG_ERR - packets which have been logged and which can be considered short</screen>

      <!-- XXX: "can be considered short" == "with incomplete header" -->

      <para>To setup IPFILTER to log all data to
	<filename>/var/log/ipfilter.log</filename>, you will need to
	create the file.  The following command will do that:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch /var/log/ipfilter.log</userinput></screen>

      <para>The syslog function is controlled by definition statements
	in the <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> file.  The
	<filename>syslog.conf</filename> file offers considerable
	flexibility in how syslog will deal with system messages issued
	by software applications like IPF.</para>

      <para>Add the following statement to
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>security.* /var/log/ipfilter.log</programlisting>

      <para>Or add the following statement to
        <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>security.*</literal>
	means to write all the logged messages to the coded
	file location.</para>

      <para>To activate the changes to <filename>/etc/syslog.conf

      <title>Building the Rule Script with Symbolic
	Substitution</title>

      <para>Some experienced IPF users create a file containing the
	rules and code them in a manner compatible with running them as
	a script with symbolic substitution.  The major benefit of
	doing this is that you only have to change the value associated
	with the symbolic name and when the script is run all the rules
	containing the symbolic name will have the value substituted in
	the rules.  Being a script, you can use symbolic substitution
	to code frequently used values and substitute them in multiple
	rules.  You will see this in the following example.</para>

      <para>The script syntax used here is compatible with the sh, csh,
	and tcsh shells.</para>

      <para>Symbolic substitution fields are prefixed with a dollar
	sign: <literal>&dollar;</literal>.</para>

      <para>Symbolic fields do not have the &dollar; prefix.</para>

      <para>A rule set is a group of ipf rules coded to pass or block
	packets based on the values contained in the packet.  The
	bi-directional exchange of packets between hosts comprises a
	session conversation.  The firewall rule set processes the
	packet two times, once on its arrival from the public Internet
	host and again as it leaves for its return trip back to the
	public Internet host.  Each TCP/IP service (i.e. telnet, www,
	mail, etc.) is predefined by its protocol, source and
	destination IP address, or the source and destination port
	number.  This is the basic selection criteria used to create
	rules which will pass or block services.</para>

	  may be used.  When the port appears as part of the from
	  object, it matches the source port number; when it appears
	  as part of the to object, it matches the destination port
	  number.  The use of the port option with the

      <!-- XXX: duplicated -->

      <para>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
	exchange of packets comprising a session conversation.  When
	activated, keep-state dynamically generates internal rules for
	each anticipated packet being exchanged during the
	bi-directional session conversation.  It has the interrogation
	abilities to determine if the session conversation between the
	originating sender and the destination are following the valid
	procedure of bi-directional packet exchange.  Any packets that
	do not properly fit the session conversation template are
	automatically rejected as impostors.</para>

      <para>Keep state will also allow ICMP packets related to a
	<acronym>TCP</acronym> or UDP session through.  So if you get
	ICMP type 3 code 4 in response to some web surfing allowed out
	by a keep state rule, they will be automatically allowed in.
	Any packet that IPF can be certain is part of an active
	session, even if it is a different protocol, will be let
	in.</para>

      <para>What happens is:</para>

      <para>Packets destined to go out the interface connected to the
	public Internet are first checked against the dynamic state
	table, if the packet matches the next expected packet
	comprising in a active session conversation, then it exits the
	firewall and the state of the session conversation flow is
	updated in the dynamic state table, the remaining packets get
	checked against the outbound rule set.</para>

      <para>Packets coming in to the interface connected to the public
	Internet are first checked against the dynamic state table, if
	the packet matches the next expected packet comprising a
	active session conversation, then it exits the firewall and
	the state of the session conversation flow is updated in the
	dynamic state table, the remaining packets get checked against
	the inbound rule set.</para>

      <para>When the conversation completes it is removed from the
	dynamic state table.</para>

      <para>Stateful filtering allows you to focus on blocking/passing
	new sessions.  If the new session is passed, all its subsequent
	packets will be allowed through automatically and any impostors
	automatically rejected.  If a new session is blocked, none of
	its subsequent packets will be allowed through.  Stateful
	filtering has technically advanced interrogation abilities
	capable of defending against the flood of different attack
	methods currently employed by attackers.</para>

      <title>Inclusive Rule Set Example</title>

      <para>The following rule set is an example of how to code a very
	secure inclusive type of firewall.  An inclusive firewall only
	allows services matching pass rules through and blocks all
	other by default.  All firewalls have at the minimum two
	interfaces which have to have rules to allow the firewall to
	function.</para>

      <para>All &unix; flavored systems including &os; are designed to
	use interface <filename>lo0</filename> and IP address
	<systemitem class="ipaddress">127.0.0.1</systemitem> for internal
	communication within the operating system.  The firewall rules
	must contain rules to allow free unmolested movement of these
	special internally used packets.</para>

      <para>The interface which faces the public Internet is the one
	where you place your rules to authorize and control access out
	to the public Internet and access requests arriving from the
	public Internet.  This can be your user PPP
	<filename>tun0</filename> interface or your NIC that is
	connected to your DSL or cable modem.</para>

      <para>In cases where one or more NICs are cabled to private LANs
	behind the firewall, those interfaces must have a rule coded to
	allow free unmolested movement of packets originating from
	those LAN interfaces.</para>

      <para>The rules should be first organized into three major
	sections: all the free unmolested interfaces, the public
	interface outbound, and the public interface inbound.</para>

      <para>The rules in each of the public interface sections should
	have the most frequently matched rules placed before less
	commonly matched rules, with the last rule in the section
	blocking and logging all packets on that interface and
	direction.</para>

      <para>The Outbound section in the following rule set only
	contains 'pass' rules which contain selection values that
	uniquely identify the service that is authorized for public
	Internet access.  All the rules have the 'quick', 'on',
	'proto', 'port', and 'keep state' option coded.  The 'proto
	tcp' rules have the 'flag' option included to identify the
	session start request as the triggering packet to activate the
	stateful facility.</para>

      <para>The Inbound section has all the blocking of undesirable
	packets first, for two different reasons.  The first is that
	these things being blocked may be part of an otherwise valid
	packet which may be allowed in by the later authorized service
	rules.  The second reason is that by having a rule that
	explicitly blocks selected packets that I receive on an
	infrequent basis and that I do not want to see in the log, they
	will not be caught by the last rule in the section which blocks
	and logs all packets which have fallen through the rules.  The
	last rule in the section which blocks and logs all packets is
	how you create the legal evidence needed to prosecute the
	people who are attacking your system.</para>

      <para>Another thing you should take note of, is there is no
	response returned for any of the undesirable stuff, their
	packets just get dropped and vanish.  This way the attacker
	has no knowledge if his packets have reached your system.  The
	less the attackers can learn about your system, the more
	time they must invest before actually doing something bad.
	The inbound 'nmap OS fingerprint' attempts rule I log

	<!-- XXX: what? -->

	the first occurrence because this is something a attacker
	would do.</para>

      <para>Any time you see log messages on a rule with 'log first'.
	You should do an <command>ipfstat -hio</command> command to see
	the number of times the rule has been matched so you know if
	you are being flooded, i.e. under attack.</para>

      <para>When you log packets with port numbers you do not
	recognize, look it up in <filename>/etc/services</filename> or
	go to <uri xlink:href="http://www.securitystats.com/tools/portsearch.php">http://www.securitystats.com/tools/portsearch.php</uri>
	and do a port number lookup to find what the purpose of that
	port number is.</para>

      <para>Check out this link for port numbers used by Trojans <uri xlink:href="http://www.simovits.com/trojans/trojans.html">http://www.simovits.com/trojans/trojans.html</uri>.</para>

      <para>The following rule set is a complete very secure
	'inclusive' type of firewall rule set that I have used on my
	system.  You can not go wrong using this rule set for your own.
	Just comment out any pass rules for services that you do not
	want to authorize.</para>

      <para>If you see messages in your log that you want to stop
	seeing just add a block rule in the inbound section.</para>

      <para>You have to change the <filename>dc0</filename>
	interface name in every rule to the interface name of the Nic
	card that connects your system to the public Internet.  For
	user PPP it would be <filename>tun0</filename>.</para>

      <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> stands for Network Address
	Translation.  To those familiar with &linux;, this concept is
	called IP Masquerading; <acronym>NAT</acronym> and IP
	Masquerading are the same thing.  One of the many things the
	IPF <acronym>NAT</acronym> function enables is the ability to
	have a private Local Area Network (LAN) behind the firewall
	sharing a single ISP assigned IP address on the public
	Internet.</para>

      <para>You may ask why would someone want to do this.  ISPs
	normally assign a dynamic IP address to their non-commercial
	users.  Dynamic means that the IP address can be different each
	time you dial in and log on to your ISP, or for cable and DSL
	modem users when you power off and then power on your modems
	you can get assigned a different IP address.  This IP address
	is how you are known to the public Internet.</para>

      <para>Now lets say you have five PCs at home and each one needs
	Internet access.  You would have to pay your ISP for an
	individual Internet account for each PC and have five phone
	lines.</para>

      <para>With <acronym>NAT</acronym> you only need a single account
	with your ISP, then cable your other four PCs to a switch and
	the switch to the NIC in your &os; system which is going to
	service your LAN as a gateway. <acronym>NAT</acronym> will
	automatically translate the private LAN IP address for each
	separate PC on the LAN to the single public IP address as it
	exits the firewall bound for the public Internet.  It also does
	the reverse translation for returning packets.</para>

      <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> is most often accomplished without
	the approval, or knowledge, of your ISP and in most cases is
	grounds for your ISP terminating your account if found out.
	Commercial users pay a lot more for their Internet connection
	and usually get assigned a block of static IP address which
	never change.  The ISP also expects and consents to their
	Commercial customers using <acronym>NAT</acronym> for their
	internal private LANs.</para>

      <para>There is a special range of IP addresses reserved for
	<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed private LAN IP address.  According to
	RFC 1918, you can use the following IP ranges for private nets
	which will never be routed directly to the public
	Internet:</para>

      <title>How <acronym>NAT</acronym> works</title>

      <para>A packet arrives at the firewall from the LAN with a public
	destination.  It passes through the outbound filter rules,
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> gets his turn at the packet and applies
	its rules top down, first matching rule wins.
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> tests each of its rules against the
	packets interface name and source IP address.  When a packets
	interface name matches a <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule then the
	[source IP address, i.e. private LAN IP address] of the packet
	is checked to see if it falls within the IP address range
	specified to the left of the arrow symbol on the
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> rule.  On a match the packet has its
	source IP address rewritten with the public IP address
	obtained by the <literal>0/32</literal> keyword.
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> posts a entry in its internal
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> table so when the packet returns from

      <para>For networks that have large numbers of PC's on the LAN or
	networks with more than a single LAN, the process of funneling
	all those private IP addresses into a single public IP address
	becomes a resource problem that may cause problems with the

	<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed LAN PC's, causing collisions.  There
	are two ways to relieve this resource problem.</para>

	<title>Assigning Ports to Use</title>

	<!-- What does it mean ? Is there something missing ?-->
	<!-- XXXBLAH <- Apparently you can't start a sect
	     with a <programlisting> tag ?-->

	<para>A normal NAT rule would look like:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32</programlisting>

	<para>In the above rule the packet's source port is unchanged
	  as the packet passes through IP<acronym>NAT</acronym>.  By
	  adding the portmap keyword you can tell
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> to only use source ports in a range.
	  For example the following rule will tell
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> to modify the source port to be
	  within that range:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 20000:60000</programlisting>

	<para>Additionally we can make things even easier by using the
	  <literal>auto</literal> keyword to tell
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> to determine by itself which ports
	  are available to use:</para>

	  the public IP addresses as packet-addresses are mapped on their way

      <title>Port Redirection</title>

      <para>A very common practice is to have a web server, email

	has to be some way to direct the inbound traffic to the
	correct LAN PCs.  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> has the redirection
	facilities of <acronym>NAT</acronym> to solve this problem.
	Lets say you have your web server on LAN address <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.0.10.25</systemitem> and your single public IP

      <title>FTP and <acronym>NAT</acronym></title>

      <para>FTP is a dinosaur left over from the time before the
	Internet as it is known today, when research universities were
	leased lined together and FTP was used to share files among
	research Scientists.  This was a time when data security was
	not a consideration.  Over the years the FTP protocol became
	buried into the backbone of the emerging Internet and its
	username and password being sent in clear text was never
	changed to address new security concerns.  FTP has two flavors,
	it can run in active mode or passive mode.  The difference is
	in how the data channel is acquired.  Passive mode is more
	secure as the data channel is acquired be the ordinal ftp
	session requester.  For a real good explanation of FTP and the
	different modes see <uri xlink:href="http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html">http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html</uri>.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> Rules</title>

	<para>IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> has a special built in FTP proxy
	  option which can be specified on the <acronym>NAT</acronym>
	  map rule.  It can monitor all outbound packet traffic for FTP
	  active or passive start session requests and dynamically
	  create temporary filter rules containing only the port number
	  really in use for the data channel.  This eliminates the
	  security risk FTP normally exposes the firewall to from
	  having large ranges of high order port numbers open.</para>

	<para>This rule will handle all the traffic for the internal
	  LAN:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp</programlisting>

	<para>This rule handles the FTP traffic from the
	  gateway:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 0.0.0.0/0 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp</programlisting>

	<para>This rule handles all non-FTP traffic from the internal
	  LAN:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32</programlisting>

	<para>The FTP map rule goes before our regular map rule.  All
	  packets are tested against the first rule from the top.
	  Matches on interface name, then private LAN source IP
	  address, and then is it a FTP packet.  If all that matches
	  then the special FTP proxy creates temp filter rules to let
	  the FTP session packets pass in and out, in addition to also
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ing the FTP packets.  All LAN packets
	  that are not FTP do not match the first rule and fall
	  through to the third rule and are tested, matching on
	  interface and source IP, then are
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ed.</para>

	<title>FTP <acronym>NAT</acronym> Proxy Bug</title>

	<para>As of IPFILTER version 3.4.31
	  the FTP proxy works as documented during the FTP session
	  until the session is told to close.  When the close happens
	  packets returning from the remote FTP server are blocked and
	  logged coming in on port 21.  The <acronym>NAT</acronym>
	  FTP/proxy appears to remove its temp rules prematurely,
	  before receiving the response from the remote FTP server
	  acknowledging the close.  A problem report was posted to the
	  IPF mailing list.</para>

	<para>The solution is to add a filter rule to get rid of these
	  unwanted log messages or do nothing and ignore FTP inbound
	  error messages in your log.  Most people do not use outbound
	  FTP too often.</para>

    <para>The IPFIREWALL (IPFW) is a &os; sponsored firewall software
      application authored and maintained by &os; volunteer staff
      members.  It uses the legacy stateless rules and a legacy rule
      coding technique to achieve what is referred to as Simple
      Stateful logic.</para>

    <para>The IPFW sample rule set (found in
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename>) in the standard &os;
      install is rather simple and it is not expected that it used
      directly without modifications.  The example does not use
      stateful filtering, which is beneficial in most setups, so it
      will not be used as base for this section.</para>

    <para>The IPFW stateless rule syntax is empowered with technically
      sophisticated selection capabilities which far surpasses the
      knowledge level of the customary firewall installer.  IPFW is
      targeted at the professional user or the advanced technical
      computer hobbyist who have advanced packet selection
      requirements.  A high degree of detailed knowledge into how
      different protocols use and create their unique packet header
      information is necessary before the power of the IPFW rules can
      be unleashed.  Providing that level of explanation is out of the
      scope of this section of the handbook.</para>

    <para>IPFW is composed of seven components, the primary component
      is the kernel firewall filter rule processor and its integrated
      packet accounting facility, the logging facility, the 'divert'
      rule which triggers the <acronym>NAT</acronym> facility, and the
      advanced special purpose facilities, the dummynet traffic shaper
      facilities, the 'fwd rule' forward facility, the bridge
      facility, and the ipstealth facility.</para>

	    the rule set, the dynamic rules table is checked at the
	    first keep-state or limit rule.</para>

	  <title>Logging</title>

	  <para><parameter>log</parameter> or
	    <parameter>logamount</parameter></para>

	  <para>When a packet matches a rule with the log keyword, a
	    message will be logged to syslogd with a facility name of
	    SECURITY.  The logging only occurs if the number of
	    packets logged so far for that particular rule does not
	    exceed the logamount parameter.  If no logamount is
	    specified, the limit is taken from the sysctl variable
	    net.inet.ip.fw.verbose_limit.  In both cases, a value of
	    zero removes the logging limit.  Once the limit is
	    reached, logging can be re-enabled by clearing the
	    logging counter or the packet counter for that rule, see
	    the ipfw reset log command.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Logging is done after
	      all other packet matching conditions have been
	      successfully verified, and before performing the final
	      action (accept, deny) on the packet.  It is up to you to
	      decide which rules you want to enable logging on.</para>

	  <title>Selection</title>

	  <para>The keywords described in this section are used to
	    describe attributes of the packet to be interrogated when
	    determining whether rules match the packet or not.
	    The following general-purpose attributes are provided for
	    matching, and must be used in this order:</para>

	  <para><parameter>udp | tcp | icmp</parameter></para>

	  <para>or any protocol names found in
	    <filename>/etc/protocols</filename> are recognized and may
	    be used.  The value specified is protocol to be matched
	    against.  This is a mandatory requirement.</para>

	  <para><parameter>from src to dst</parameter></para>

	  <para>The from and to keywords are used to match against IP
	    addresses.  Rules must specify BOTH source and destination
	    parameters. <literal>any</literal> is a special keyword
	    that matches any IP address. <literal>me</literal> is a
	    special keyword that matches any IP address configured on
	    an interface in your &os; system to represent the PC the
	    firewall is running on (i.e. this box) as in 'from me to
	    any' or 'from any to me' or 'from 0.0.0.0/0 to any' or
	    'from any to 0.0.0.0/0' or 'from 0.0.0.0 to any' or 'from
	    any to 0.0.0.0' or 'from me to 0.0.0.0'.  IP addresses are
	    specified as a dotted IP address numeric form/mask-length,
	    or as single dotted IP address numeric form.  This is a
	    mandatory requirement.  See this link for help on writing
	    mask-lengths. <uri xlink:href="http://jodies.de/ipcalc">http://jodies.de/ipcalc</uri></para>

	  <para><parameter>port number</parameter></para>

	  <para>For protocols which support port numbers (such as
	    <acronym>TCP</acronym> and UDP).  It is mandatory that you
	    code the port number of the service you want to match
	    on.  Service names (from
	    <filename>/etc/services</filename>) may be used instead of
	    numeric port values.</para>

	  <para><parameter>in | out</parameter></para>

	  <para>Matches incoming or outgoing packets, respectively.
	    The in and out are keywords and it is mandatory that you
	    code one or the other as part of your rule matching
	    criterion.</para>

	  <para><parameter>via IF</parameter></para>

	  <para>Matches packets going through the interface specified
	    by exact name.  The <literal>via</literal> keyword causes
	    the interface to always be checked as part of the match
	    process.</para>

	  <para><parameter>setup</parameter></para>

	  <para>This is a mandatory keyword that identifies the session
	    start request for <acronym>TCP</acronym> packets.</para>

	  <para><parameter>keep-state</parameter></para>

	  <para>This is a mandatory&gt; keyword.  Upon a match, the
	    firewall will create a dynamic rule, whose default behavior
	    is to match bidirectional traffic between source and
	    destination IP/port using the same protocol.</para>

	  <para><parameter>limit {src-addr | src-port | dst-addr |
	      dst-port}</parameter></para>

	  <para>The firewall will only allow
	    <replaceable>N</replaceable> connections with the same set
	    of parameters as specified in the rule.  One or more of
	    source and destination addresses and ports can be
	    specified.  The 'limit' and 'keep-state' can not be used on
	    same rule.  Limit provides the same stateful function as
	    'keep-state' plus its own functions.</para>

	<indexterm>

	  <secondary>stateful filtering</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<!-- XXX: duplicated -->

	<para>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
	  exchange of packets comprising a session conversation.  It
	  has the interrogation abilities to determine if the session
	  conversation between the originating sender and the
	  destination are following the valid procedure of
	  bi-directional packet exchange.  Any packets that do not
	  properly fit the session conversation template are
	  automatically rejected as impostors.</para>

	<para>'check-state' is used to identify where in the IPFW rules
	  set the packet is to be tested against the dynamic rules
	  facility.  On a match the packet exits the firewall to
	  continue on its way and a new rule is dynamic created for
	  the next anticipated packet being exchanged during this
	  bi-directional session conversation.  On a no match the
	  packet advances to the next rule in the rule set for
	  testing.</para>

	<para>The dynamic rules facility is vulnerable to resource
	  depletion from a SYN-flood attack which would open a huge
	  number of dynamic rules.  To counter this attack, &os;
	  added another new option named limit.  This
	  option is used to limit the number of simultaneous session
	  conversations by interrogating the rules source or
	  destinations fields as directed by the limit option and
	  using the packet's IP address found there, in a search of
	  the open dynamic rules counting the number of times this
	  rule and IP address combination occurred, if this count is
	  greater that the value specified on the limit option, the
	  packet is discarded.</para>

	<title>Logging Firewall Messages</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>IPFW</primary>

	  <secondary>logging</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>The benefits of logging are obvious: it provides the
	  ability to review after the fact the rules you activated
	  logging on which provides information like, what packets had
	  been dropped, what addresses they came from, where they were
	  going, giving you a significant edge in tracking down
	  attackers.</para>

	<para>Even with the logging facility enabled, IPFW will not
	  generate any rule logging on it's own.  The firewall
	  administrator decides what rules in the rule set he wants
	  to log and adds the log verb to those rules.  Normally only
	  deny rules are logged, like the deny rule for incoming
	  <acronym>ICMP</acronym> pings.  It is very customary to
	  duplicate the ipfw default deny everything rule with the
	  log verb included as your last rule in the rule set.  This
	  way you get to see all the packets that did not match any
	  of the rules in the rule set.</para>

	<para>Logging is a two edged sword, if you are not careful, you
	  can lose yourself in the over abundance of log data and fill
	  your disk up with growing log files.  DoS attacks that fill
	  up disk drives is one of the oldest attacks around.  These
	  log message are not only written to syslogd, but also are
	  displayed on the root console screen and soon become very
	  annoying.</para>

	<para>The <literal>IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=5</literal>
	  kernel option limits the number of consecutive messages
	  sent to the system logger syslogd, concerning the packet
	  matching of a given rule.  When this option is enabled in
	  the kernel, the number of consecutive messages concerning
	  a particular rule is capped at the number specified.  There
	  is nothing to be gained from 200 log messages saying the
	  same identical thing.  For instance, five consecutive
	  messages concerning a particular rule would be logged to
	  syslogd, the remainder identical consecutive messages would
	  be counted and posted to the syslogd with a phrase like
	  this:</para>

	<programlisting>last message repeated 45 times</programlisting>

	<para>All logged packets messages are written by default to
	  <filename>/var/log/security</filename> file, which is defined
	  in the <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> file.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="firewalls-ipfw-rules-script">
	<title>Building a Rule Script</title>

	<para>Most experienced IPFW users create a file containing the
	  rules and code them in a manner compatible with running them
	  as a script.  The major benefit of doing this is the firewall
	  rules can be refreshed in mass without the need of rebooting
	  the system to activate the new rules.  This method is very
	  convenient in testing new rules as the procedure can be
	  executed as many times as needed.  Being a script, you can
	  use symbolic substitution to code frequent used values and
	  substitution them in multiple rules.  You will see this in
	  the following example.</para>

	<para>The script syntax used here is compatible with the 'sh',
	  'csh', 'tcsh' shells.  Symbolic substitution fields are
	  prefixed with a dollar sign &dollar;.  Symbolic fields do not
	  have the &dollar; prefix.  The value to populate the Symbolic
	  field must be enclosed to "double quotes".</para>

	<title>Stateful Ruleset</title>

	<para>The following non-<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed rule set is an
	  example of how to code a very secure 'inclusive' type of
	  firewall.  An inclusive firewall only allows services
	  matching pass rules through and blocks all other by default.
	  All firewalls have at the minimum two interfaces which have
	  to have rules to allow the firewall to function.</para>

	<para>All &unix; flavored operating systems, &os; included, are
	  designed to use interface <filename>lo0</filename> and IP
	  address <systemitem class="ipaddress">127.0.0.1</systemitem> for internal
	  communication with in the operating system.  The firewall
	  rules must contain rules to allow free unmolested movement of
	  these special internally used packets.</para>

	<para>The interface which faces the public Internet, is the one
	  which you code your rules to authorize and control access out
	  to the public Internet and access requests arriving from the
	  public Internet.  This can be your ppp
	  <filename>tun0</filename> interface or your NIC that is
	  connected to your DSL or cable modem.</para>

	<para>In cases where one or more than one NIC are connected to
	  a private LANs behind the firewall, those interfaces must
	  have rules coded to allow free unmolested movement of
	  packets originating from those LAN interfaces.</para>

	<para>The rules should be first organized into three major
	  sections, all the free unmolested interfaces, public
	  interface outbound, and the public interface inbound.</para>

	<para>The order of the rules in each of the public interface
	  sections should be in order of the most used rules being
	  placed before less often used rules with the last rule in
	  the section being a block log all packets on that interface
	  and direction.</para>

	<para>The Outbound section in the following rule set only
	  contains 'allow' rules which contain selection values that
	  uniquely identify the service that is authorized for public
	  Internet access.  All the rules have the, proto, port,
	  in/out, via and keep state option coded.  The 'proto tcp'
	  rules have the 'setup' option included to identify the start
	  session request as the trigger packet to be posted to the
	  keep state stateful table.</para>

	<para>The Inbound section has all the blocking of undesirable
	  packets first for two different reasons.  First is these
	  things being blocked may be part of an otherwise valid packet
	  which may be allowed in by the later authorized service
	  rules.  Second reason is that by having a rule that
	  explicitly blocks selected packets that I receive on an
	  infrequent bases and do not want to see in the log, this
	  keeps them from being caught by the last rule in the section
	  which blocks and logs all packets which have fallen through
	  the rules.  The last rule in the section which blocks and
	  logs all packets is how you create the legal evidence needed
	  to prosecute the people who are attacking your system.</para>

	<para>Another thing you should take note of, is there is no
	  response returned for any of the undesirable stuff, their
	  packets just get dropped and vanish.  This way the attackers
	  has no knowledge if his packets have reached your system.
	  The less the attackers can learn about your system the more
	  secure it is.  When you log packets with port numbers you do
	  not recognize, look the numbers up in
	  <filename>/etc/services/</filename> or go to <uri xlink:href="http://www.securitystats.com/tools/portsearch.php">http://www.securitystats.com/tools/portsearch.php</uri>
	  and do a port number lookup to find what the purpose of that
	  port number is.  Check out this link for port numbers used by
	  Trojans: <uri xlink:href="http://www.simovits.com/trojans/trojans.html">http://www.simovits.com/trojans/trojans.html</uri>.</para>

	<title>An Example Inclusive Ruleset</title>

	<para>The following non-<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed rule set is a
	  complete inclusive type ruleset.  You can not go wrong using
	  this rule set for you own.  Just comment out any pass rules
	  for services you do not want.  If you see messages in your
	  log that you want to stop seeing just add a deny rule in the
	  inbound section.  You have to change the 'dc0' interface name
	  in every rule to the interface name of the NIC that connects
	  your system to the public Internet.  For user ppp it would be
	  'tun0'.</para>

	<para>You will see a pattern in the usage of these
	  rules.</para>

	  into a custom kernel.</para>

	<para>In addition to the normal IPFW options in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the following are
	  needed.</para>

	<programlisting>natd_enable="YES"                   # Enable <acronym>NAT</acronym>D function
natd_interface="rl0"                # interface name of public Internet NIC
natd_flags="-dynamic -m"            # -m = preserve port numbers if possible</programlisting>

	<para>Utilizing stateful rules with divert natd rule (Network
	  Address Translation) greatly complicates the rule set coding
	  logic.  The positioning of the check-state, and 'divert natd'
	  rules in the rule set becomes very critical.  This is no
	  longer a simple fall-through logic flow.  A new action type
	  is used, called 'skipto'.  To use the skipto command it is
	  mandatory that you number each rule so you know exactly
	  where the skipto rule number is you are really jumping
	  to.</para>

	<para>The following is an uncommented example of one coding
	  method, selected here to explain the sequence of the packet
	  flow through the rule sets.</para>

	<para>The processing flow starts with the first rule from the
	  top of the rule file and progress one rule at a time deeper
	  into the file until the end is reach or the packet being
	  tested to the selection criteria matches and the packet is
	  released out of the firewall.  It is important to take notice
	  of the location of rule numbers 100 101, 450, 500, and 510.
	  These rules control the translation of the outbound and
	  inbound packets so their entries in the keep-state dynamic
	  table always register the private LAN IP address.  Next
	  notice that all the allow and deny rules specified the
	  direction the packet is going (IE outbound or inbound) and
	  the interface.  Also notice that all the start outbound
	  session requests all skipto rule 500 for the network address
	  translation.</para>

	<para>Lets say a LAN user uses their web browser to get a web
	  page.  Web pages use port 80 to communicate over.  So the
	  packet enters the firewall, It does not match 100 because it
	  is headed out not in.  It passes rule 101 because this is the
	  first packet so it has not been posted to the keep-state
	  dynamic table yet.  The packet finally comes to rule 125 a
	  matches.  It is outbound through the NIC facing the public
	  Internet.  The packet still has it's source IP address as a
	  private LAN IP address.  On the match to this rule, two
	  actions take place.  The keep-state option will post this
	  rule into the keep-state dynamic rules table and the
	  specified action is executed.  The action is part of the info
	  posted to the dynamic table.  In this case it is "skipto rule
	  500".  Rule 500 <acronym>NAT</acronym>s the packet IP address
	  and out it goes.  Remember this, this is very important.
	  This packet makes its way to the destination and returns and
	  enters the top of the rule set.  This time it does match rule
	  100 and has it destination IP address mapped back to its
	  corresponding LAN IP address.  It then is processed by the
	  check-state rule, it's found in the table as an existing
	  session conversation and released to the LAN.  It goes to the
	  LAN PC that sent it and a new packet is sent requesting
	  another segment of the data from the remote server.  This
	  time it gets checked by the check-state rule and its outbound
	  entry is found,  the associated action, 'skipto 500', is
	  executed.  The packet jumps to rule 500 gets
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ed and released on it's way out.</para>

	<para>On the inbound side, everything coming in that is part
	  of an existing session conversation is being automatically
	  handled by the check-state rule and the properly placed
	  divert natd rules.  All we have to address is denying all the
	  bad packets and only allowing in the authorized services.
	  Lets say there is a apache server running on the firewall box
	  and we want people on the public Internet to be able to
	  access the local web site.  The new inbound start request
	  packet matches rule 100 and its IP address is mapped to LAN
	  IP for the firewall box.  The packet is them matched against
	  all the nasty things we want to check for and finally matches
	  against rule 425.  On a match two things occur.  The packet
	  rule is posted to the keep-state dynamic table but this time
	  any new session requests originating from that source IP
	  address is limited to 2.  This defends against DoS attacks of
	  service running on the specified port number.  The action is
	  allow so the packet is released to the LAN.  On return the
	  check-state rule recognizes the packet as belonging to an
	  existing session conversation sends it to rule 500 for
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ing and released to outbound
	  interface.</para>

    <para>For one machine to be able to find another over a network,
      there must be a mechanism in place to describe how to get from
      one to the other.  This is called
      <firstterm>routing</firstterm>.  A <quote>route</quote> is a
      defined pair of addresses: a <quote>destination</quote> and a
      <quote>gateway</quote>.  The pair indicates that if you are
      trying to get to this <emphasis>destination</emphasis>,
      communicate through this <emphasis>gateway</emphasis>.  There
      are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, and
      <quote>default</quote>.  The <quote>default route</quote> is
      used if none of the other routes apply.  We will talk a little
      bit more about default routes later on.  There are also three
      types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces (also called
      <quote>links</quote>), and Ethernet hardware addresses (MAC
      addresses).
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>An Example</title>

      <para>To illustrate different aspects of routing, we will use the
	following example from <command>netstat</command>:</para>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The first two lines specify the default route (which we
	will cover in the <link linkend="network-routing-default">next
	  section</link>) and the <systemitem>localhost</systemitem> route.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>loopback device</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The interface (<literal>Netif</literal> column) that this
	routing table specifies to use for
	<literal>localhost</literal> is <filename>lo0</filename>,
	also known as the loopback device.  This says to keep all
	traffic for this destination internal, rather than sending it
	out over the LAN, since it will only end up back where it
	started.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Ethernet</primary>
        <secondary>MAC address</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The next thing that stands out are the addresses beginning
	with <systemitem class="etheraddress">0:e0:</systemitem>.  These are Ethernet
	hardware addresses, which are also known as MAC addresses.
	FreeBSD will automatically identify any hosts
	(<systemitem>test0</systemitem> in the example) on the local Ethernet
	and add a route for that host, directly to it over the
	Ethernet interface, <filename>ed0</filename>.  There is
	also a timeout (<literal>Expire</literal> column) associated
	with this type of route, which is used if we fail to hear from
	the host in a specific amount of time.  When this happens, the
	route to this host will be automatically deleted.  These hosts
	are identified using a mechanism known as RIP (Routing
	Information Protocol), which figures out routes to local hosts
	based upon a shortest path determination.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>
      <para>FreeBSD will also add subnet routes for the local subnet (<systemitem class="ipaddress">10.20.30.255</systemitem> is the broadcast address for the
	subnet <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.20.30</systemitem>, and <systemitem class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem> is the domain name associated
	with that subnet).  The designation <literal>link#1</literal> refers
	to the first Ethernet card in the machine.  You will notice no
	additional interface is specified for those.</para>

      <para>Both of these groups (local network hosts and local subnets) have
	their routes automatically configured by a daemon called
	<application>routed</application>.  If this is not run, then only
	routes which are statically defined (i.e. entered explicitly) will
	exist.</para>

      <para>The <literal>host1</literal> line refers to our host, which it
	knows by Ethernet address.  Since we are the sending host, FreeBSD
	knows to use the loopback interface (<filename>lo0</filename>)
	rather than sending it out over the Ethernet interface.</para>

      <para>The two <literal>host2</literal> lines are an example of
	what happens when we use an &man.ifconfig.8; alias (see the
	section on Ethernet for reasons why we would do this).  The
	<literal>=&gt;</literal> symbol after the
	<filename>lo0</filename> interface says that not only are
	we using the loopback (since this address also refers to the
	local host), but specifically it is an alias.  Such routes
	only show up on the host that supports the alias; all other
	hosts on the local network will simply have a
	<literal>link#1</literal> line for such routes.</para>

      <para>The final line (destination subnet <systemitem class="ipaddress">224</systemitem>) deals
	with multicasting, which will be covered in another section.</para>

      <para>Finally, various attributes of each route can be seen in
	the <literal>Flags</literal> column.  Below is a short table
	of some of these flags and their meanings:</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="network-routing-default">
      <title>Default Routes</title>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>When the local system needs to make a connection to a remote host,
	it checks the routing table to determine if a known path exists.  If
	the remote host falls into a subnet that we know how to reach (Cloned
	routes), then the system checks to see if it can connect along that
	interface.</para>

      <para>If all known paths fail, the system has one last option: the
	<quote>default</quote> route.  This route is a special type of gateway
	route (usually the only one present in the system), and is always
	marked with a <literal>c</literal> in the flags field.  For hosts on a
	local area network, this gateway is set to whatever machine has a
	direct connection to the outside world (whether via PPP link,
	DSL, cable modem, T1, or another network interface).</para>

      <para>If you are configuring the default route for a machine which
	itself is functioning as the gateway to the outside world, then the
	default route will be the gateway machine at your Internet Service
	Provider's (ISP) site.</para>

      <para>Let us look at an example of default routes.  This is a common
	configuration:</para>

      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata fileref="advanced-networking/net-routing"/>
	</imageobject>

	<textobject>
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">
[Local2]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [Local1]  &lt;--PPP--&gt; [ISP-Serv]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [T1-GW]
      </literallayout>
	</textobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The hosts <systemitem>Local1</systemitem> and
	<systemitem>Local2</systemitem> are at your site.
	<systemitem>Local1</systemitem> is connected to an ISP via a dial up
	PPP connection.  This PPP server computer is connected through
	a local area network to another gateway computer through an
	external interface to the ISPs Internet feed.</para>

      <para>The default routes for each of your machines will be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="3">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Gateway</entry>
	      <entry>Interface</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>

	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2</entry>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>Ethernet</entry>
	    </row>

	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW</entry>
	      <entry>PPP</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>A common question is <quote>Why (or how) would we set
	the <systemitem>T1-GW</systemitem> to be the default gateway for
	<systemitem>Local1</systemitem>, rather than the ISP server it is
	connected to?</quote>.</para>

      <para>Remember, since the PPP interface is using an address on the ISP's
	local network for your side of the connection, routes for any other
	machines on the ISP's local network will be automatically generated.
	Hence, you will already know how to reach the <systemitem>T1-GW</systemitem>
	machine, so there is no need for the intermediate step
	of sending traffic to the ISP server.</para>

      <para>It is common to use the address <systemitem class="ipaddress">X.X.X.1</systemitem> as the gateway address for your local
	network.  So (using the same example), if your local class-C address
	space was <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.20.30</systemitem> and your ISP was
	using <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.9.9</systemitem> then the default routes
	would be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="2">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Route</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2 (10.20.30.2)</entry>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1, 10.9.9.30)</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW (10.9.9.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>You can easily define the default route via the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.  In our example, on the
	<systemitem>Local2</systemitem> machine, we added the following line
	in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>defaultrouter="10.20.30.1"</programlisting>

      <para>It is also possible to do it directly from the command
	line with the &man.route.8; command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add default 10.20.30.1</userinput></screen>

      <para>For more information on manual manipulation of network
	routing tables, consult &man.route.8; manual page.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Dual Homed Hosts</title>
      <indexterm><primary>dual homed hosts</primary></indexterm>
      <para>There is one other type of configuration that we should cover, and
	that is a host that sits on two different networks.  Technically, any
	machine functioning as a gateway (in the example above, using a PPP
	connection) counts as a dual-homed host.  But the term is really only
	used to refer to a machine that sits on two local-area
	networks.</para>

      <para>In one case, the machine has two Ethernet cards, each
	having an address on the separate subnets.  Alternately, the
	machine may only have one Ethernet card, and be using
	&man.ifconfig.8; aliasing.  The former is used if two
	physically separate Ethernet networks are in use, the latter
	if there is one physical network segment, but two logically
	separate subnets.</para>

      <para>Either way, routing tables are set up so that each subnet knows
	that this machine is the defined gateway (inbound route) to the other
	subnet.  This configuration, with the machine acting as a router
	between the two subnets, is often used when we need to implement
	packet filtering or firewall security in either or both
	directions.</para>

      <para>If you want this machine to actually forward packets
        between the two interfaces, you need to tell FreeBSD to enable
        this ability.  See the next section for more details on how
	to do this.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="network-dedicated-router">
      <title>Building a Router</title>

      <indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A network router is simply a system that forwards packets
	from one interface to another.  Internet standards and good
	engineering practice prevent the FreeBSD Project from enabling
	this by default in FreeBSD.  You can enable this feature by
	changing the following variable to <literal>YES</literal> in
	&man.rc.conf.5;:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable=YES          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway</programlisting>

      <para>This option will set the &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>net.inet.ip.forwarding</varname> to
	<literal>1</literal>.  If you should need to stop routing
	temporarily, you can reset this to <literal>0</literal> temporarily.</para>

      <para>Your new router will need routes to know where to send the
	traffic.  If your network is simple enough you can use static
	routes.  FreeBSD also comes with the standard BSD routing
	daemon &man.routed.8;, which speaks RIP (both version 1 and
	version 2) and IRDP.  Support for BGP v4, OSPF v2, and other
	sophisticated routing protocols is available with the
	<package>net/zebra</package> package.
	Commercial products such as <application>&gated;</application> are also available for more
	complex network routing solutions.</para>

	<para>In this scenario, <systemitem>RouterA</systemitem> is our &os;
	  machine that is acting as a router to the rest of the
	  Internet.  It has a default route set to <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.0.0.1</systemitem> which allows it to connect
	  with the outside world.  We will assume that
	  <systemitem>RouterB</systemitem> is already configured properly and
	  knows how to get wherever it needs to go.  (This is simple
	  in this picture.  Just add a default route on
	  <systemitem>RouterB</systemitem> using <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.1.1</systemitem> as the gateway.)</para>

	<para>If we look at the routing table for

	<para>With the current routing table  <systemitem>RouterA</systemitem>
	  will not be able to reach our Internal Net 2.  It does not
	  have a route for <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.2.0/24</systemitem>.  One way to alleviate
	  this is to manually add the route.  The following command
	  would add the Internal Net 2 network to
	  <systemitem>RouterA</systemitem>'s routing table using <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.1.2</systemitem> as the next hop:</para>

	  network.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Persistent Configuration</title>

	<para>The above example is perfect for configuring a static
	  route on a running system.  However, one problem is that the
	  routing information will not persist if you reboot your &os;
	  machine.  The way to handle the addition of a static route
	  is to put it in your <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	  file:</para>

	<programlisting># Add Internal Net 2 as a static route
static_routes="internalnet2"
route_internalnet2="-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</programlisting>

	<para>The <literal>static_routes</literal> configuration
	  variable is a list of strings separated by a space.  Each
	  string references to a route name.  In our above example we
	  only have one string in <literal>static_routes</literal>.
	  This string is <replaceable>internalnet2</replaceable>.  We
	  then add a configuration variable called
	  <literal>route_internalnet2</literal>
	  where we put all of the configuration parameters we would
	  give to the &man.route.8; command.  For our example above we
	  would have used the command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2</userinput></screen>

	  <para>so we need <literal>"-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</literal>.</para>

	<para>As said above, we can have more than one string in
	  <literal>static_routes</literal>.  This allows us to
	  create multiple static routes.  The following lines shows
	  an example of adding static routes for the <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.0.0/24</systemitem> and <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.1.0/24</systemitem> networks on an imaginary
	  router:</para>

      <title>Wireless Networking Basics</title>

      <para>Most wireless networks are based on the IEEE 802.11
	standards.  A basic wireless network consists of multiple
	stations communicating with radios that broadcast in either
	the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band (though this varies according to the
	locale and is also changing to enable communication in the
	2.3GHz and 4.9GHz ranges).</para>

      <para>802.11 networks are organized in two ways: in
	<emphasis>infrastructure mode</emphasis> one station acts as a
	master with all the other stations associating to it; the
	network is known as a BSS and the master station is termed an
	access point (AP).  In a BSS all communication passes through
	the AP; even when one station wants to communicate with
	another wireless station messages must go through the AP.  In
	the second form of network there is no master and stations
	communicate directly.  This form of network is termed an IBSS
	and is commonly known as an <emphasis>ad-hoc
	network</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>802.11 networks were first deployed in the 2.4GHz band
	using protocols defined by the IEEE 802.11 and 802.11b
	standard.  These specifications include the operating
	frequencies, MAC layer characteristics including framing and
	transmission rates (communication can be done at various
	rates).  Later the 802.11a standard defined operation in the
	5GHz band, including different signalling mechanisms and
	higher transmission rates.  Still later the 802.11g standard
	was defined to enable use of 802.11a signalling and
	transmission mechanisms in the 2.4GHz band in such a way as to
	be backwards compatible with 802.11b networks.</para>

      <para>Separate from the underlying transmission techniques
	802.11 networks have a variety of security mechanisms.  The
	original 802.11 specifications defined a simple security
	protocol called WEP. This protocol uses a fixed pre-shared key
	and the RC4 cryptographic cipher to encode data transmitted on
	a network.  Stations must all agree on the fixed key in order
	to communicate.  This scheme was shown to be easily broken and
	is now rarely used except to discourage transient users from
	joining networks.  Current security practice is given by the
	IEEE 802.11i specification that defines new cryptographic
	ciphers and an additional protocol to authenticate stations to
	an access point and exchange keys for doing data
	communication.  Further, cryptographic keys are periodically
	refreshed and there are mechanisms for detecting intrusion
	attempts (and for countering intrusion attempts).  Another
	security protocol specification commonly used in wireless
	networks is termed WPA.  This was a precursor to 802.11i
	defined by an industry group as an interim measure while
	waiting for 802.11i to be ratified.  WPA specifies a subset of
	the requirements found in 802.11i and is designed for
	implementation on legacy hardware.  Specifically WPA requires
	only the TKIP cipher that is derived from the original WEP
	cipher.  802.11i permits use of TKIP but also requires support
	for a stronger cipher, AES-CCM, for encrypting data.  (The AES
	cipher was not required in WPA because it was deemed too
	computationally costly to be implemented on legacy
	hardware.)</para>

      <para>Other than the above protocol standards the other
	important standard to be aware of is 802.11e.  This defines
	protocols for deploying multi-media applications such as
	streaming video and voice over IP (VoIP) in an 802.11 network.
	Like 802.11i, 802.11e also has a precursor specification
	termed WME (later renamed WMM) that has been defined by an
	industry group as a subset of 802.11e that can be deployed now
	to enable multi-media applications while waiting for the final
	ratification of 802.11e.  The most important thing to know
	about 802.11e and WME/WMM is that it enables prioritized
	traffic use of a wireless network through Quality of Service
	(QoS) protocols and enhanced media access protocols.  Proper
	implementation of these protocols enable high speed bursting
	of data and prioritized traffic flow.</para>

      <para>Since the 6.0 version, &os; supports networks that operate
	using 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.  The WPA and 802.11i
	security protocols are likewise supported (in conjunction with
	any of 11a, 11b, and 11g) and QoS and traffic prioritization
	required by the WME/WMM protocols are supported for a limited
	set of wireless devices.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Kernel Configuration</title>

	<para>To use wireless networking you need a wireless
	  networking card and to configure the kernel with the
	  appropriate wireless networking support.  The latter is
	  separated into multiple modules so that you only need to
	  configure the software you are actually going to use.</para>

	<para>The first thing you need is a wireless device.  The most
	  commonly used devices are those that use parts made by
	  Atheros.  These devices are supported by the &man.ath.4;
	  driver and require the following line to be added to the
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file:</para>

	<programlisting>if_ath_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>The Atheros driver is split up into three separate
	  pieces: the driver proper (&man.ath.4;), the hardware
	  support layer that handles chip-specific functions
	  (&man.ath.hal.4;), and an algorithm for selecting which of
	  several possible rates for transmitting frames
	  (ath_rate_sample here).  When you load this support as
	  modules these dependencies are automatically handled for
	  you.  If instead of an Atheros device you had another device
	  you would select the module for that device; e.g.:</para>

	<programlisting>if_wi_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>for devices based on the Intersil Prism parts
	  (&man.wi.4; driver).</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In the rest of this document, we will use an
	    &man.ath.4; device, the device name in the examples must
	    be changed according to your configuration.  A list of
	    available wireless drivers can be found at the beginning
	    of the &man.wlan.4; manual page.  If a native &os; driver
	    for your wireless device does not exist, it may be
	    possible to directly use the &windows; driver with the
	    help of the <link linkend="config-network-ndis">NDIS</link> driver
	    wrapper.</para>
	</note>

	<para>With a device driver configured you need to also bring
	  in the 802.11 networking support required by the driver.
	  For the &man.ath.4; driver this is at least the &man.wlan.4;
	  module; this module is automatically loaded with the
	  wireless device driver.  With that you will need the modules
	  that implement cryptographic support for the security
	  protocols you intend to use.  These are intended to be
	  dynamically loaded on demand by the &man.wlan.4; module but
	  for now they must be manually configured.  The following
	  modules are available: &man.wlan.wep.4;, &man.wlan.ccmp.4;
	  and &man.wlan.tkip.4;.  Both &man.wlan.ccmp.4; and
	  &man.wlan.tkip.4; drivers are only needed if you intend to
	  use the WPA and/or 802.11i security protocols.  If your
	  network is to run totally open (i.e., with no encryption)
	  then you do not even need the &man.wlan.wep.4; support.  To
	  load these modules at boot time, add the following lines to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>wlan_wep_load="YES"
wlan_ccmp_load="YES"
wlan_tkip_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>With this information in the system bootstrap
	  configuration file (i.e.,
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>), you have to reboot
	  your &os; box.  If you do not want to reboot your machine
	  for the moment, you can just load the modules by hand using
	  &man.kldload.8;.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>If you do not want to use modules, it is possible to
	    compile these drivers into the kernel by adding the
	    following lines to your kernel configuration file:</para>

	  <programlisting>device ath               # Atheros IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver
device ath_hal           # Atheros Hardware Access Layer
device ath_rate_sample   # John Bicket's SampleRate control algorithm.
device wlan              # 802.11 support (Required)
device wlan_wep          # WEP crypto support for 802.11 devices
device wlan_ccmp         # AES-CCMP crypto support for 802.11 devices
device wlan_tkip         # TKIP and Michael crypto support for 802.11 devices</programlisting>

	  <para>With this information in the kernel configuration
	    file, recompile the kernel and reboot your &os;
	    machine.</para>
	</note>

	<para>When the system is up, we could find some information
	  about the wireless device in the boot messages, like
	  this:</para>

      <title>Infrastructure Mode</title>

      <para>The infrastructure mode or BSS mode is the mode that is
	typically used.  In this mode, a number of wireless access
	points are connected to a wired network.  Each wireless
	network has its own name, this name is called the SSID of the
	network.  Wireless clients connect to the wireless access
	points.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>How to Find Access Points</title>

	  <para>To scan for networks, use the
	    <command>ifconfig</command> command.  This request may
	    take a few moments to complete as it requires that the
	    system switches to each available wireless frequency and
	    probes for available access points.  Only the super-user
	    can initiate such a scan:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig ath0 up scan</userinput>
SSID            BSSID              CHAN RATE  S:N   INT CAPS

	  <note>
	    <para>You must mark the interface <option>up</option>
	      before you can scan.  Subsequent scan requests do not
	      require you to mark the interface up again.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The output of a scan request lists each BSS/IBSS

	  <title>Basic Settings</title>

	  <para>This section provides a simple example of how to make
	    the wireless network adapter work in &os; without
	    encryption.  After you are familiar with these concepts,
	    we strongly recommend using <link linkend="network-wireless-wpa">WPA</link> to set up your
	    wireless network.</para>

	  <para>There are three basic steps to configure a wireless
	    network: selecting an access point, authenticating your
	    station, and configuring an IP address.  The following
	    sections discuss each step.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Selecting an Access Point</title>

	    <para>Most of time it is sufficient to let the system
	      choose an access point using the builtin heuristics.
	      This is the default behaviour when you mark an interface
	      up or otherwise configure an interface by listing it in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, e.g.:</para>

	    <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>If there are multiple access points and you want to
	      select a specific one, you can select it by its
	      SSID:</para>

	    <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>In an environment where there are multiple access
	      points with the same SSID (often done to simplify
	      roaming) it may be necessary to associate to one
	      specific device.  In this case you can also specify the
	      BSSID of the access point (you can also leave off the
	      SSID):</para>

	    <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> bssid <replaceable>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>There are other ways to constrain the choice of an
	      access point such as limiting the set of frequencies the
	      system will scan on.  This may be useful if you have a
	      multi-band wireless card as scanning all the possible
	      channels can be time-consuming.  To limit operation to a
	      specific band you can use the <option>mode</option>
	      parameter; e.g.:</para>

	    <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="mode <replaceable>11g</replaceable> ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>will force the card to operate in 802.11g which is
	      defined only for 2.4GHz frequencies so any 5GHz channels
	      will not be considered.  Other ways to do this are the
	      <option>channel</option> parameter, to lock operation to
	      one specific frequency, and the
	      <option>chanlist</option> parameter, to specify a list
	      of channels for scanning.  More information about these
	      parameters can be found in the &man.ifconfig.8; manual
	      page.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Authentication</title>

	    <para>Once you have selected an access point your station
	      needs to authenticate before it can pass data.
	      Authentication can happen in several ways.  The most
	      common scheme used is termed open authentication and
	      allows any station to join the network and communicate.
	      This is the authentication you should use for test
	      purpose the first time you set up a wireless network.
	      Other schemes require cryptographic handshakes be
	      completed before data traffic can flow; either using
	      pre-shared keys or secrets, or more complex schemes that
	      involve backend services such as RADIUS.  Most users
	      will use open authentication which is the default
	      setting.  Next most common setup is WPA-PSK, also known
	      as WPA Personal, which is described <link linkend="network-wireless-wpa-wpa-psk">below</link>.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>If you have an &apple; &airport; Extreme base
		station for an access point you may need to configure
		shared-key authentication together with a WEP key.
		This can be done in the
		<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file or using the
		&man.wpa.supplicant.8; program.  If you have a single
		&airport; base station you can setup access with
		something like:</para>

	      <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="authmode shared wepmode on weptxkey <replaceable>1</replaceable> wepkey <replaceable>01234567</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	      <para>In general shared key authentication is to be
		avoided because it uses the WEP key material in a
		highly-constrained manner making it even easier to
		crack the key.  If WEP must be used (e.g., for
		compatibility with legacy devices) it is better to use
		WEP with <literal>open</literal> authentication.  More
		information regarding WEP can be found in the <xref linkend="network-wireless-wep"/>.</para>
	    </note>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Getting an IP Address with DHCP</title>

	    <para>Once you have selected an access point and set the
	      authentication parameters, you will have to get an IP
	      address to communicate.  Most of time you will obtain
	      your wireless IP address via DHCP.  To achieve that,
	      simply edit <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and add
	      <literal>DHCP</literal> to the configuration for your
	      device as shown in various examples above:</para>

	    <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>At this point, you are ready to bring up the
	      wireless interface:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/netif start</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Once the interface is running, use
	      <command>ifconfig</command> to see the status of the

	  <title>WPA</title>

	  <para>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a security protocol
	    used together with 802.11 networks to address the lack of
	    proper authentication and the weakness of <link linkend="network-wireless-wep">WEP</link>.  WPA leverages
	    the 802.1X authentication protocol and uses one of several
	    ciphers instead of WEP for data integrity.  The only
	    cipher required by WPA is TKIP (Temporary Key Integrity
	    Protocol) which is a cipher that extends the basic RC4
	    cipher used by WEP by adding integrity checking, tamper
	    detection, and measures for responding to any detected
	    intrusions.  TKIP is designed to work on legacy hardware
	    with only software modification; it represents a
	    compromise that improves security but is still not
	    entirely immune to attack.  WPA also specifies the
	    AES-CCMP cipher as an alternative to TKIP and that is
	    preferred when possible; for this specification the term
	    WPA2 (or RSN) is commonly used.</para>

	  <para>WPA defines authentication and encryption protocols.
	    Authentication is most commonly done using one of two
	    techniques: by 802.1X and a backend authentication service
	    such as RADIUS, or by a minimal handshake between the
	    station and the access point using a pre-shared secret.
	    The former is commonly termed WPA Enterprise with the
	    latter known as WPA Personal.  Since most people will not
	    set up a RADIUS backend server for wireless network,
	    WPA-PSK is by far the most commonly encountered
	    configuration for WPA.</para>

	  <para>The control of the wireless connection and the
	    authentication (key negotiation or authentication with a
	    server) is done with the &man.wpa.supplicant.8; utility.
	    This program requires a configuration file,
	    <filename>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</filename>, to run.
	    More information regarding this file can be found in the
	    &man.wpa.supplicant.conf.5; manual page.</para>

	  <sect5 xml:id="network-wireless-wpa-wpa-psk">
	    <title>WPA-PSK</title>

	    <para>WPA-PSK also known as WPA-Personal is based on a
	      pre-shared key (PSK) generated from a given password and
	      that will be used as the master key in the wireless
	      network.  This means every wireless user will share the
	      same key.  WPA-PSK is intended for small networks where
	      the use of an authentication server is not possible or
	      desired.</para>

	    <para>PEAP (Protected EAP) has been designed as an

	      methods, the most common one is PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2.  In

	      refers to that EAP method.  PEAP is the most used EAP
	      standard after EAP-TLS, in other words if you have a
	      network with mixed OSes, PEAP should be the most
	      supported standard after EAP-TLS.</para>

	    <para>PEAP is similar to EAP-TTLS: it uses a server-side
	      certificate to authenticate clients by creating an
	      encrypted TLS tunnel between the client and the
	      authentication server, which protects the ensuing
	      exchange of authentication information.  In term of
	      security the difference between EAP-TTLS and PEAP is
	      that PEAP authentication broadcasts the username in
	      clear, only the password is sent in the encrypted TLS

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal networks
        operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a range of 10 meters.
        Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from portable devices such as
        cellular phones, handhelds and laptops. Unlike the other popular
        wireless technology, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth offers higher level service
        profiles, e.g. FTP-like file servers, file pushing, voice transport,
        serial line emulation, and more.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth stack in &os; is implemented using the Netgraph
        framework (see &man.netgraph.4;). A broad variety of Bluetooth USB
        dongles is supported by the &man.ng.ubt.4; driver. The Broadcom BCM2033
        chip based Bluetooth devices are supported via the &man.ubtbcmfw.4; and
        &man.ng.ubt.4; drivers. The 3Com Bluetooth PC Card 3CRWB60-A is
        supported by the &man.ng.bt3c.4; driver. Serial and UART based
        Bluetooth devices are supported via &man.sio.4;, &man.ng.h4.4;
        and &man.hcseriald.8;. This section describes the use of the USB
        Bluetooth dongle.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Plugging in the Device</title>
      <para>By default Bluetooth device drivers are available as kernel modules.
        Before attaching a device, you will need to load the driver into the
        kernel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ng_ubt</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the Bluetooth device is present in the system during system
        startup, load the module from
        <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>ng_ubt_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Plug in your USB dongle. The output similar to the following will
        appear on the console (or in syslog):</para>

      <screen>ubt0: vendor 0x0a12 product 0x0001, rev 1.10/5.25, addr 2

      wMaxPacketSize=49, nframes=6, buffer size=294</screen>

      <note>
	<para>The Bluetooth stack has to be started manually on &os; 6.0, and
	  on &os; 5.X before 5.5.  It is done automatically from &man.devd.8;
	  on &os; 5.5, 6.1 and newer.</para>

      <para>Copy
        <filename>/usr/share/examples/netgraph/bluetooth/rc.bluetooth</filename>
        into some convenient place, like <filename>/etc/rc.bluetooth</filename>.
        This script is used to start and stop the Bluetooth stack. It is a good
        idea to stop the stack before unplugging the device, but it is not
        (usually) fatal. When starting the stack, you will receive output similar
        to the following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.bluetooth start ubt0</userinput>

      <title>Host Controller Interface (HCI)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>HCI</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Host Controller Interface (HCI) provides a command interface to the
        baseband controller and link manager, and access to hardware status and
        control registers. This interface provides a uniform method of accessing
        the Bluetooth baseband capabilities. HCI layer on the Host exchanges
        data and commands with the HCI firmware on the Bluetooth hardware.
        The Host Controller Transport Layer (i.e. physical bus) driver provides
        both HCI layers with the ability to exchange information with each
        other.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>hci</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The HCI node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth device driver node (downstream) and
        the L2CAP node (upstream). All HCI operations must be performed
        on the HCI node and not on the device driver node. Default name
        for the HCI node is <quote>devicehci</quote>.
        For more details refer to the &man.ng.hci.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>One of the most common tasks is discovery of Bluetooth devices in
        RF proximity. This operation is called <emphasis>inquiry</emphasis>.
        Inquiry and other HCI related operations are done with the
        &man.hccontrol.8; utility. The example below shows how to find out
        which Bluetooth devices are in range. You should receive the list of
        devices in a few seconds. Note that a remote device will only answer
        the inquiry if it put into <emphasis>discoverable</emphasis>
        mode.</para>

      <para><literal>BD_ADDR</literal> is unique address of a Bluetooth
        device, similar to MAC addresses of a network card. This address
        is needed for further communication with a device. It is possible
        to assign human readable name to a BD_ADDR.
        The <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hosts</filename> file contains information
        regarding the known Bluetooth hosts. The following example shows how
        to obtain human readable name that was assigned to the remote
        device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci remote_name_request 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>
BD_ADDR: 00:80:37:29:19:a4
Name: Pav's T39</screen>

      <para>If you perform an inquiry on a remote Bluetooth device, it will
        find your computer as <quote>your.host.name (ubt0)</quote>. The name
        assigned to the local device can be changed at any time.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection (only two
        Bluetooth units involved), or a point-to-multipoint connection. In the
        point-to-multipoint connection the connection is shared among several
        Bluetooth devices. The following example shows how to obtain the list
        of active baseband connections for the local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci read_connection_list</userinput>
Remote BD_ADDR    Handle Type Mode Role Encrypt Pending Queue State
00:80:37:29:19:a4     41  ACL    0 MAST    NONE       0     0 OPEN</screen>

      <para>A <emphasis>connection handle</emphasis> is useful when termination
        of the baseband connection is required. Note, that it is normally not
        required to do it by hand. The stack will automatically terminate
        inactive baseband connections.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci disconnect 41</userinput>
Connection handle: 41
Reason: Connection terminated by local host [0x16]</screen>

      <para>Refer to <command>hccontrol help</command> for a complete listing
        of available HCI commands. Most of the HCI commands do not require
        superuser privileges.</para>

      <title>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>L2CAP</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) provides
        connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer
        protocols with protocol multiplexing capability and segmentation and
        reassembly operation. L2CAP permits higher level protocols and
        applications to transmit and receive L2CAP data packets up to 64
        kilobytes in length.</para>

      <para>L2CAP is based around the concept of <emphasis>channels</emphasis>.
        Channel is a logical connection on top of baseband connection. Each
        channel is bound to a single protocol in a many-to-one fashion. Multiple
        channels can be bound to the same protocol, but a channel cannot be
        bound to multiple protocols. Each L2CAP packet received on a channel is
        directed to the appropriate higher level protocol. Multiple channels
        can share the same baseband connection.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>l2cap</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The L2CAP node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth HCI node (downstream) and Bluetooth sockets
        nodes (upstream). Default name for the L2CAP node is
        <quote>devicel2cap</quote>. For more details refer to the
        &man.ng.l2cap.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>A useful command is &man.l2ping.8;, which can be used to ping
        other devices. Some Bluetooth implementations might not return all of
        the data sent to them, so <literal>0 bytes</literal> in the following
        example is normal.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>l2ping -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>
0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=0 time=48.633 ms result=0

0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=3 time=46.150 ms result=0</screen>

      <para>The &man.l2control.8; utility is used to perform various operations
        on L2CAP nodes. This example shows how to obtain the list of logical
        connections (channels) and the list of baseband connections for the
        local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>l2control -a 00:02:72:00:d4:1a read_channel_list</userinput>

      <para>Another diagnostic tool is &man.btsockstat.1;. It does a job
        similar to as &man.netstat.1; does, but for Bluetooth network-related
        data structures. The example below shows the same logical connection as

      <title>RFCOMM Protocol</title>

      <indexterm><primary>RFCOMM</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports over the
        L2CAP protocol. The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10.
        RFCOMM is a simple transport protocol, with additional provisions for
        emulating the 9 circuits of RS-232 (EIATIA-232-E) serial ports. The
        RFCOMM protocol supports up to 60 simultaneous connections (RFCOMM
        channels) between two Bluetooth devices.</para>

      <para>For the purposes of RFCOMM, a complete communication path involves
        two applications running on different devices (the communication
        endpoints) with a communication segment between them. RFCOMM is intended
        to cover applications that make use of the serial ports of the devices
        in which they reside. The communication segment is a Bluetooth link from
        one device to another (direct connect).</para>

      <para>RFCOMM is only concerned with the connection between the devices in
        the direct connect case, or between the device and a modem in the
        network case. RFCOMM can support other configurations, such as modules
        that communicate via Bluetooth wireless technology on one side and
        provide a wired interface on the other side.</para>

      <para>In &os; the RFCOMM protocol is implemented at the Bluetooth sockets
        layer.</para>

      <title>Pairing of Devices</title>

      <indexterm><primary>pairing</primary></indexterm>

      <para>By default, Bluetooth communication is not authenticated, and any
        device can talk to any other device. A Bluetooth device (for example,
        cellular phone) may choose to require authentication to provide a
        particular service (for example, Dial-Up service). Bluetooth
        authentication is normally done with <emphasis>PIN codes</emphasis>.
        A PIN code is an ASCII string up to 16 characters in length. User is
        required to enter the same PIN code on both devices. Once user has
        entered the PIN code, both devices will generate a
        <emphasis>link key</emphasis>. After that the link key can be stored
        either in the devices themselves or in a persistent storage. Next time
        both devices will use previously generated link key. The described
        above procedure is called <emphasis>pairing</emphasis>. Note that if
        the link key is lost by any device then pairing must be repeated.</para>

      <para>The &man.hcsecd.8; daemon is responsible for handling of all
        Bluetooth authentication requests. The default configuration file is
        <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf</filename>. An example section for
        a cellular phone with the PIN code arbitrarily set to
        <quote>1234</quote> is shown below:</para>

      <programlisting>device {
        bdaddr  00:80:37:29:19:a4;
        name    "Pav's T39";
        key     nokey;
        pin     "1234";
      }</programlisting>

      <para>There is no limitation on PIN codes (except length). Some devices
        (for example Bluetooth headsets) may have a fixed PIN code built in.
        The <option>-d</option> switch forces the &man.hcsecd.8; daemon to stay
        in the foreground, so it is easy to see what is happening. Set the
        remote device to receive pairing and initiate the Bluetooth connection
        to the remote device. The remote device should say that pairing was
        accepted, and request the PIN code. Enter the same PIN code as you
        have in <filename>hcsecd.conf</filename>. Now your PC and the remote
        device are paired. Alternatively, you can initiate pairing on the remote
        device.</para>

      <para>On &os; 5.5, 6.1 and newer, the following line can be added to the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file to have
	<application>hcsecd</application> started automatically on system
	start:</para>

      <programlisting>hcsecd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>The following is a sample of the
        <application>hcsecd</application> daemon output:</para>

      <title>Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>SDP</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) provides the means for client
        applications to discover the existence of services provided by server
        applications as well as the attributes of those services. The attributes
        of a service include the type or class of service offered and the
        mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the service.</para>

      <para>SDP involves communication between a SDP server and a SDP client.
        The server maintains a list of service records that describe the
        characteristics of services associated with the server. Each service
        record contains information about a single service. A client may
        retrieve information from a service record maintained by the SDP server
        by issuing a SDP request. If the client, or an application associated
        with the client, decides to use a service, it must open a separate
        connection to the service provider in order to utilize the service.
        SDP provides a mechanism for discovering services and their attributes,
        but it does not provide a mechanism for utilizing those services.</para>

      <para>Normally, a SDP client searches for services based on some desired
        characteristics of the services. However, there are times when it is
        desirable to discover which types of services are described by an SDP
        server's service records without any a priori information about the
        services. This process of looking for any offered services is called
        <emphasis>browsing</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth SDP server &man.sdpd.8; and command line client
        &man.sdpcontrol.8; are included in the standard &os; installation.
        The following example shows how to perform a SDP browse query.</para>

      <para>... and so on. Note that each service has a list of attributes
        (RFCOMM channel for example). Depending on the service you might need to
        make a note of some of the attributes. Some Bluetooth implementations do
        not support service browsing and may return an empty list. In this case
        it is possible to search for the specific service. The example below
        shows how to search for the OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) service:</para>

      <para>Offering services on &os; to Bluetooth clients is done with the
	&man.sdpd.8; server. On &os; 5.5, 6.1 and newer, the following line can
	be added to the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>sdpd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Then the <application>sdpd</application> daemon can be started with:</para>

      <para>On &os; 6.0, and on &os; 5.X before 5.5,
	<application>sdpd</application> is not integrated into the system
	startup scripts.  It has to be started manually with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sdpd</userinput></screen>

      <para>The local server application that wants to provide Bluetooth
        service to the remote clients will register service with the local
        SDP daemon. The example of such application is &man.rfcomm.pppd.8;.
        Once started it will register Bluetooth LAN service with the local
        SDP daemon.</para>

      <para>The list of services registered with the local SDP server can be
        obtained by issuing SDP browse query via local control channel:</para>

      <title>Dial-Up Networking (DUN) and Network Access with PPP (LAN)
        Profiles</title>

      <para>The Dial-Up Networking (DUN) profile is mostly used with modems
        and cellular phones. The scenarios covered by this profile are the
        following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>use of a cellular phone or modem by a computer as

          receive data calls.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Network Access with PPP (LAN) profile can be used in the following
        situations:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>LAN access for a single Bluetooth device;
           </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>LAN access for multiple Bluetooth devices;

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In &os; both profiles are implemented with &man.ppp.8; and
        &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; - a wrapper that converts RFCOMM Bluetooth
        connection into something PPP can operate with. Before any profile
        can be used, a new PPP label in the <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>
        must be created. Consult &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; manual page for examples.
      </para>

      <para>In the following example &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will be used to open
        RFCOMM connection to remote device with BD_ADDR 00:80:37:29:19:a4 on
        DUN RFCOMM channel. The actual RFCOMM channel number will be obtained
        from the remote device via SDP. It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel
        by hand, and in this case &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will not perform SDP
        query. Use &man.sdpcontrol.8; to find out RFCOMM
        channel on the remote device.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rfcomm_pppd -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4 -c -C dun -l rfcomm-dialup</userinput></screen>

      <para>In order to provide Network Access with PPP (LAN) service the

        &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; manual page for examples. Finally, start RFCOMM PPP
        server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The RFCOMM PPP server will

      <title>OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) Profile</title>

      <indexterm><primary>OBEX</primary></indexterm>

      <para>OBEX is a widely used protocol for simple file transfers between
        mobile devices. Its main use is in infrared communication, where it is
        used for generic file transfers between notebooks or PDAs,
        and for sending business cards or calendar entries between cellular
        phones and other devices with PIM applications.</para>

      <para>The OBEX server and client are implemented as a third-party package
        <application>obexapp</application>, which is available as
	<package>comms/obexapp</package> port.</para>

      <para>OBEX client is used to push and/or pull objects from the OBEX server.
        An object can, for example, be a business card or an appointment.
        The OBEX client can obtain RFCOMM channel number from the remote device
        via SDP. This can be done by specifying service name instead of RFCOMM
        channel number. Supported service names are: IrMC, FTRN and OPUSH.
        It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel as a number. Below is an
        example of an OBEX session, where device information object is pulled
        from the cellular phone, and a new object (business card) is pushed
        into the phone's directory.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>obexapp -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4 -C IrMC</userinput>

      <para>In order to provide OBEX Object Push service,
        &man.sdpd.8; server must be running. A root folder, where all incoming
        objects will be stored, must be created. The default path to the root
        folder is <filename>/var/spool/obex</filename>. Finally, start OBEX
        server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The OBEX server will
        automatically register OBEX Object Push service with the local SDP
        daemon. The example below shows how to start OBEX server.</para>

      <title>Serial Port Profile (SPP)</title>
      <para>The Serial Port Profile (SPP) allows Bluetooth devices to perform
        RS232 (or similar) serial cable emulation. The scenario covered by this
        profile deals with legacy applications using Bluetooth as a cable
        replacement, through a virtual serial port abstraction.</para>

      <para>The &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; utility implements the Serial Port profile.
        A pseudo tty is used as a virtual serial port abstraction. The example
        below shows how to connect to a remote device Serial Port service.
        Note that you do not have to specify a RFCOMM channel -
        &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; can obtain it from the remote device via SDP.
        If you would like to override this, specify a RFCOMM channel on the
        command line.</para>

      <title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <sect3>
        <title>A remote device cannot connect</title>
        <para>Some older Bluetooth devices do not support role switching.
          By default, when &os; is accepting a new connection, it tries to
          perform a role switch and become master. Devices, which do not
          support this will not be able to connect. Note that role switching is
          performed when a new connection is being established, so it is not
          possible to ask the remote device if it does support role switching.
          There is a HCI option to disable role switching on the local
          side:</para>

	  <package>comms/hcidump</package> port.
          The <application>hcidump</application> utility is similar to
          &man.tcpdump.1;. It can be used to display the content of the Bluetooth

      <indexterm><primary>IP subnet</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>bridge</primary></indexterm>
      <para>It is sometimes useful to divide one physical network
	(such as an Ethernet segment) into two separate network
	segments without having to create IP subnets and use a router
	to connect the segments together.  A device that connects two
	networks together in this fashion is called a
	<quote>bridge</quote>.  A FreeBSD system with two network
	interface cards can act as a bridge.</para>

      <para>The bridge works by learning the MAC layer addresses
	(Ethernet addresses) of the devices on each of its network interfaces.
	It forwards traffic between two networks only when its source and
	destination are on different networks.</para>

      <para>In many respects, a bridge is like an Ethernet switch with very
	few ports.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Situations Where Bridging Is Appropriate</title>

      <para>There are two common situations in which a bridge is used
	today.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>High Traffic on a Segment</title>

	<para>Situation one is where your physical network segment is
	  overloaded with traffic, but you do not want for whatever reason to
	  subnet the network and interconnect the subnets with a
	  router.</para>

	<para>Let us consider an example of a newspaper where the Editorial and
	  Production departments are on the same subnetwork.  The Editorial
	  users all use server <systemitem>A</systemitem> for file service, and the Production users
	  are on server <systemitem>B</systemitem>.  An Ethernet network is used to connect all users together,
	  and high loads on the network are slowing things down.</para>

	<para>If the Editorial users could be segregated on one
	  network segment and the Production users on another, the two
	  network segments could be connected with a bridge.  Only the
	  network traffic destined for interfaces on the
	  <quote>other</quote> side of the bridge would be sent to the
	  other network, reducing congestion on each network
	  segment.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Filtering/Traffic Shaping Firewall</title>
	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>NAT</primary></indexterm>

	<para>The second common situation is where firewall functionality is
	  needed without network address translation (NAT).</para>

	<para>An example is a small company that is connected via DSL
	  or ISDN to their ISP.  They have a 13 globally-accessible IP
	  addresses from their ISP and have 10 PCs on their network.
	  In this situation, using a router-based firewall is
	  difficult because of subnetting issues.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>DSL</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>ISDN</primary></indexterm>
	<para>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and dropped into the
	  path just downstream of their DSL/ISDN router without any IP
	  numbering issues.</para>

      <title>Configuring a Bridge</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Network Interface Card Selection</title>

	<para>A bridge requires at least two network cards to function.
	  Unfortunately, not all network interface cards
	  support bridging.  Read &man.bridge.4; for details on the cards that
	  are supported.</para>

	<para>Install and test the two network cards before continuing.</para>

	<title>Firewall Support</title>
	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<para>If you are planning to use the bridge as a firewall, you
	  will need to add the <literal>IPFIREWALL</literal> option as
	  well.  Read <xref linkend="firewalls"/> for general
	  information on configuring the bridge as a firewall.</para>

	<para>If you need to allow non-IP packets (such as ARP) to flow
	  through the bridge, there is a firewall option that
	  must be set.  This option is
	  <literal>IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT</literal>.  Note that this
	  changes the default rule for the firewall to accept any packet.
	  Make sure you know how this changes the meaning of your ruleset
	  before you set it.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Traffic Shaping Support</title>

	<para>If you want to use the bridge as a traffic shaper, you will need

      <title>Enabling the Bridge</title>

      <para>Add the line:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</programlisting>

	runtime, and the line:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.config=<replaceable>if1</replaceable>,<replaceable>if2</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>to enable bridging on the specified interfaces (replace
	<replaceable>if1</replaceable> and
	<replaceable>if2</replaceable> with the names of your two
	network interfaces).  If you want the bridged packets to be
	filtered by &man.ipfw.8;, you should add:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.ipfw=1</programlisting>

      <para>as well.</para>

    <para>A FreeBSD machine can boot over the network and operate without a

      <title>Background Information</title>

      <para>Setting up diskless workstations is both relatively
	straightforward and prone to errors.  These are sometimes
	difficult to diagnose for a number of reasons.  For example:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Compile time options may determine different behaviors at
	    runtime.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Error messages are often cryptic or totally absent.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In this context, having some knowledge of the background
	mechanisms involved is very useful to solve the problems that
	may arise.</para>

      <para>Several operations need to be performed for a successful
	bootstrap:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to obtain initial parameters such as its IP
	    address, executable filename, server name, root path.  This is
	    done using the <acronym>DHCP</acronym> or BOOTP protocols.
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> is a compatible extension of BOOTP, and
	    uses the same port numbers and basic packet format.</para>

	  <para>It is possible to configure a system to use only BOOTP.
	    The &man.bootpd.8; server program is included in the base &os;
	    system.</para>

	  <para>However, <acronym>DHCP</acronym> has a number of advantages
	    over BOOTP (nicer configuration files, possibility of using
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, plus many others not directly related to
	    diskless operation), and we will describe mainly a
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> configuration, with equivalent examples
	    using &man.bootpd.8; when possible.  The sample configuration will
	    use the <application>ISC DHCP</application> software package
	    (release 3.0.1.r12 was installed on the test server).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to transfer one or several programs to local
	    memory.  Either <acronym>TFTP</acronym> or <acronym>NFS</acronym>
	    are used.  The choice between <acronym>TFTP</acronym> and
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is a compile time option in several places.
	    A common source of error is to specify filenames for the wrong
	    protocol: <acronym>TFTP</acronym> typically transfers all files from
	    a single directory on the server, and would expect filenames
	    relative to this directory.  <acronym>NFS</acronym> needs absolute
	    file paths.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The possible intermediate bootstrap programs and the kernel
	    need to be initialized and executed.  There are several important
	    variations in this area:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> will load &man.pxeboot.8;, which is
		a modified version of the &os; third stage loader.  The
		&man.loader.8; will obtain most parameters necessary to system
		startup, and leave them in the kernel environment before
		transferring control.  It is possible to use a
		<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel in this case.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><application>Etherboot</application>, will directly
		load the kernel, with less preparation.  You will need to
		build a kernel with specific options.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> and <application>Etherboot</application>
	    work equally well; however, because kernels
	    normally let the &man.loader.8; do more work for them,
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym> is the preferred method.</para>

	  <para>If your <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and network cards support
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, you should probably use it.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Finally, the machine needs to access its file systems.
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is used in all cases.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD's ISDN implementation supports only the DSS1/Q.931
	(or Euro-ISDN) standard using passive cards.  Some active cards
	are supported where the firmware
	also supports other signaling protocols; this also includes the
	first supported Primary Rate (PRI) ISDN card.</para>

      <para>The <application>isdn4bsd</application> software allows you to connect
	to other ISDN routers using either IP over raw HDLC or by using
	synchronous PPP: either by using kernel PPP with <literal>isppp</literal>, a
	modified &man.sppp.4; driver, or by using userland &man.ppp.8;.  By using
	userland &man.ppp.8;, channel bonding of two or more ISDN
	B-channels is possible.  A telephone answering machine
	application is also available as well as many utilities such as
	a software 300 Baud modem.</para>

      <para>Some growing number of PC ISDN cards are supported under
	FreeBSD and the reports show that it is successfully used all
	over Europe and in many other parts of the world.</para>

      <para>The passive ISDN cards supported are mostly the ones with
	the Infineon (formerly Siemens) ISAC/HSCX/IPAC ISDN chipsets,
	but also ISDN cards with chips from Cologne Chip (ISA bus only),
	PCI cards with Winbond W6692 chips, some cards with the
	Tiger300/320/ISAC chipset combinations and some vendor specific
	chipset based cards such as the AVM Fritz!Card PCI V.1.0 and the
	AVM Fritz!Card PnP.</para>

      <para>Currently the active supported ISDN cards are the AVM B1
	(ISA and PCI) BRI cards and the AVM T1 PCI PRI cards.</para>

      <title>ISDN Terminal Adapters</title>

      <para>Terminal adapters (TA), are to ISDN what modems are to regular
	phone lines.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>modem</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Most TA's use the standard Hayes modem AT command set, and can be
	used as a drop in replacement for a modem.</para>

      <para>A TA will operate basically the same as a modem except connection
	and throughput speeds will be much faster than your old modem.  You
	will need to configure <link linkend="ppp">PPP</link> exactly the same
	as for a modem setup.  Make sure you set your serial speed as high as
	possible.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The main advantage of using a TA to connect to an Internet
	Provider is that you can do Dynamic PPP.  As IP address space becomes
	more and more scarce, most providers are not willing to provide you
	with a static IP anymore.  Most stand-alone routers are not able to
	accommodate dynamic IP allocation.</para>

      <para>TA's completely rely on the PPP daemon that you are running for
	their features and stability of connection.  This allows you to
	upgrade easily from using a modem to ISDN on a FreeBSD machine, if you
	already have PPP set up.  However, at the same time any problems you
	experienced with the PPP program and are going to persist.</para>

      <para>If you want maximum stability, use the kernel <link linkend="ppp">PPP</link> option, not the <link linkend="userppp">userland PPP</link>.</para>

      <para>The following TA's are known to work with FreeBSD:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Motorola BitSurfer and Bitsurfer Pro</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Adtran</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Most other TA's will probably work as well, TA vendors try to make
	sure their product can accept most of the standard modem AT command
	set.</para>

      <para>The real problem with external TA's is that, like modems,
	you need a good serial card in your computer.</para>

      <para>You should read the <link xlink:href="&url.articles.serial-uart;/index.html">FreeBSD Serial
	Hardware</link> tutorial for a detailed understanding of
	serial devices, and the differences between asynchronous and
	synchronous serial ports.</para>

      <para>A TA running off a standard PC serial port (asynchronous) limits
	you to 115.2&nbsp;Kbs, even though you have a 128&nbsp;Kbs connection.
	To fully utilize the 128&nbsp;Kbs that ISDN is capable of,
	you must move the TA to a synchronous serial card.</para>

      <para>Do not be fooled into buying an internal TA and thinking you have
	avoided the synchronous/asynchronous issue.  Internal TA's simply have
	a standard PC serial port chip built into them.  All this will do is
	save you having to buy another serial cable and find another empty
	electrical socket.</para>

      <para>A synchronous card with a TA is at least as fast as a stand-alone
	router, and with a simple 386 FreeBSD box driving it, probably more
	flexible.</para>

      <para>The choice of synchronous card/TA v.s. stand-alone router is largely a
	religious issue.  There has been some discussion of this in
	the mailing lists.  We suggest you search the <link xlink:href="&url.base;/search/index.html">archives</link> for
	the complete discussion.</para>

        <primary>ISDN</primary>
	<secondary>stand-alone bridges/routers</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>ISDN bridges or routers are not at all specific to FreeBSD
	or any other operating system.  For a more complete
	description of routing and bridging technology, please refer
	to a networking reference book.</para>

      <para>In the context of this section, the terms router and bridge will
	be used interchangeably.</para>

      <para>As the cost of low end ISDN routers/bridges comes down, it
	will likely become a more and more popular choice.  An ISDN
	router is a small box that plugs directly into your local
	Ethernet network, and manages its own connection to the other
	bridge/router.  It has built in software to communicate via
	PPP and other popular protocols.</para>

      <para>A router will allow you much faster throughput than a
	standard TA, since it will be using a full synchronous ISDN
	connection.</para>

      <para>The main problem with ISDN routers and bridges is that
	interoperability between manufacturers can still be a problem.
	If you are planning to connect to an Internet provider, you
	should discuss your needs with them.</para>

      <para>If you are planning to connect two LAN segments together,
	such as your home LAN to the office LAN, this is the simplest
	lowest
	maintenance solution.  Since you are buying the equipment for
	both sides of the connection you can be assured that the link
	will work.</para>

      <para>For example to connect a home computer or branch office
	network to a head office network the following setup could be
	used:</para>

      <para>One large advantage of most routers/bridges is that they allow you

	2 separate sites at the <emphasis>same</emphasis> time.  This is not
	supported on most TA's, except for specific (usually expensive) models
	that
	have two serial ports.  Do not confuse this with channel bonding, MPP,

      <para>This can be a very useful feature if, for example, you
	have an dedicated ISDN connection at your office and would
	like to tap into it, but do not want to get another ISDN line
	at work.  A router at the office location can manage a
	dedicated B channel connection (64&nbsp;Kbps) to the Internet
	and use the other B channel for a separate data connection.
	The second B channel can be used for dial-in, dial-out or
	dynamically bonding (MPP, etc.) with the first B channel for
	more bandwidth.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD's Network Address Translation daemon, commonly known as

        changes the source to the local machine and re-injects these packets
        back into the outgoing IP packet stream.  &man.natd.8; does this by changing
        the source IP address and port such that when data is received back,

      <para>Due to the diminishing IP space in IPv4, and the increased number
        of users on high-speed consumer lines such as cable or DSL, people are
        increasingly in need of an Internet Connection Sharing solution.  The
        ability to connect several computers online through one connection and
        IP address makes &man.natd.8; a reasonable choice.</para>

      <para>Most commonly, a user has a machine connected to a cable or DSL
        line with one IP address and wishes to use this one connected computer to
        provide Internet access to several more over a LAN.</para>

      <para>To do this, the FreeBSD machine on the Internet must act as a
        gateway.  This gateway machine must have two NICs&mdash;one for connecting

        from the Internet.  Clients on the LAN can make outgoing connections to
        the world but cannot receive incoming ones.  This presents a problem
        if trying to run Internet services on one of the LAN client machines.
        A simple way around this is to redirect selected Internet ports on the
        <application>natd</application> machine to a LAN client.
      </para>

      <para>For example, an IRC server runs on client <systemitem>A</systemitem>, and a web server runs
        on client <systemitem>B</systemitem>.  For this to work properly, connections received on ports
        6667 (IRC) and 80 (web) must be redirected to the respective machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> must be passed to
        &man.natd.8; with the proper options.  The syntax is as follows:</para>
      <programlisting>     -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                 [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                 [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]</programlisting>

      <para>In the above example, the argument should be:</para>

        <programlisting>    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

      <para>
        This will redirect the proper <emphasis>tcp</emphasis> ports to the
        LAN client machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> argument can be used to indicate port
        ranges over individual ports.  For example, <replaceable>tcp
        192.168.0.2:2000-3000 2000-3000</replaceable> would redirect
        all connections received on ports 2000 to 3000 to ports 2000
        to 3000 on client <systemitem>A</systemitem>.</para>

      <para>These options can be used when directly running
        &man.natd.8;, placed within the
        <literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option in
        <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
	or passed via a configuration file.</para>

      <para>For further configuration options, consult &man.natd.8;</para>

      <title>Address Redirection</title>
      <indexterm><primary>address redirection</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Address redirection is useful if several IP addresses are
        available, yet they must be on one machine.  With this,
        &man.natd.8; can assign each LAN client its own external IP address.
        &man.natd.8; then rewrites outgoing packets from the LAN clients
        with the proper external IP address and redirects
        all traffic incoming on that particular IP address back to
        the specific LAN client.  This is also known as static NAT.
        For example, the IP addresses <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.1</systemitem>,
        <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.2</systemitem>, and
        <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.3</systemitem> belong to the <application>natd</application> gateway
        machine.  <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.1</systemitem> can be used
        as the <application>natd</application> gateway machine's external IP address, while
        <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.2</systemitem> and
        <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.3</systemitem> are forwarded back to LAN
        clients <systemitem>A</systemitem> and <systemitem>B</systemitem>.</para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_address</option> syntax is as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>-redirect_address localIP publicIP</programlisting>

-redirect_address 192.168.0.3 128.1.1.3</programlisting>

      <para>Like <option>-redirect_port</option>, these arguments are also placed within
        the <literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option of <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, or passed via a configuration file.  With address
        redirection, there is no need for port redirection since all data
        received on a particular IP address is redirected.</para>

      <para>The external IP addresses on the <application>natd</application> machine must be active and aliased
        to the external interface.  Look at &man.rc.conf.5; to do so.</para>

    <para>IPv6 (also know as IPng <quote>IP next generation</quote>) is
      the new version of the well known IP protocol (also know as
      <acronym>IPv4</acronym>).  Like the other current *BSD systems,
      FreeBSD includes the KAME IPv6 reference implementation.
      So your FreeBSD system comes with all you will need to experiment with IPv6.
      This section focuses on getting IPv6 configured and running.</para>

    <para>In the early 1990s, people became aware of the rapidly
      diminishing address space of IPv4.  Given the expansion rate of the
      Internet there were two major concerns:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Running out of addresses.  Today this is not so much of a concern
	  anymore since RFC1918 private address space
	  (<systemitem class="ipaddress">10.0.0.0/8</systemitem>,
	  <systemitem class="ipaddress">172.16.0.0/12</systemitem>, and
	  <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.0.0/16</systemitem>)
	  and Network Address Translation (<acronym>NAT</acronym>) are
	  being employed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Router table entries were getting too large.  This is
	  still a concern today.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>IPv6 deals with these and many other issues:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>128 bit address space.  In other words theoretically there are
	  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses
	  available.  This means there are approximately

      <title>Background on IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>There are different types of IPv6 addresses: Unicast, Anycast and
	Multicast.</para>

      <para>Unicast addresses are the well known addresses.  A packet sent
	to a unicast address arrives exactly at the interface belonging to
	the address.</para>

      <para>Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast
	addresses but they address a group of interfaces.  The packet destined for
	an anycast address will arrive at the nearest (in router metric)
	interface.  Anycast addresses may only be used by routers.</para>

      <para>Multicast addresses identify a group of interfaces.  A packet destined
	for a multicast address will arrive at all interfaces belonging to the
	multicast group.</para>

	<note><para>The IPv4 broadcast address (usually <systemitem class="ipaddress">xxx.xxx.xxx.255</systemitem>) is expressed
	  by multicast addresses in IPv6.</para></note>

      <title>Reading IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>The canonical form is represented as: <systemitem>x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x</systemitem>, each
	<quote>x</quote> being a 16 Bit hex value.  For example
	<systemitem>FEBC:A574:382B:23C1:AA49:4592:4EFE:9982</systemitem></para>

      <para>Often an address will have long substrings of all zeros
	therefore one such substring per address can be abbreviated by <quote>::</quote>.
	Also up to three leading <quote>0</quote>s per hexquad can be omitted.
	For example <systemitem>fe80::1</systemitem>
	corresponds to the canonical form
	<systemitem>fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</systemitem>.</para>

      <para>A third form is to write the last 32 Bit part in the
	well known (decimal) IPv4 style with dots <quote>.</quote>
	as separators.  For example
	<systemitem>2002::10.0.0.1</systemitem>
	corresponds to the (hexadecimal) canonical representation

      <title>Getting Connected</title>

      <para>Currently there are four ways to connect to other IPv6 hosts and networks:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Join the experimental 6bone</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Getting an IPv6 network from your upstream provider.  Talk to your
	    Internet provider for instructions.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Tunnel via 6-to-4 (<link xlink:href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3068.txt">RFC3068</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Use the <package>net/freenet6</package> port if you are on a dial-up connection.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Here we will talk on how to connect to the 6bone since it currently seems
	to be the most popular way.</para>

      <para>First take a look at the <link xlink:href="http://www.6bone.net/">6bone</link> site and find a 6bone connection nearest to
	you.  Write to the responsible person and with a little bit of luck you
	will be given instructions on how to set up your connection.  Usually this
	involves setting up a GRE (gif) tunnel.</para>

      <para>Here is a typical example on setting up a &man.gif.4; tunnel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 create</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0</userinput>
gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 tunnel MY_IPv4_ADDR MY_IPv4_REMOTE_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_ADDR</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 inet6 alias MY_ASSIGNED_IPv6_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_ADDR MY_IPv6_REMOTE_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_ADDR</userinput></screen>

      <para>Replace the capitalized words by the information you received from the
	upstream 6bone node.</para>

      <para>This establishes the tunnel.  Check if the tunnel is working by &man.ping6.8;
	'ing <systemitem>ff02::1%gif0</systemitem>.  You should receive two ping replies.</para>

	<note><para>In case you are intrigued by the address <systemitem>ff02:1%gif0</systemitem>, this is a
	  multicast address.  <literal>%gif0</literal> states that the multicast address at network
	  interface <filename>gif0</filename> is to be used.  Since we <command>ping</command> a multicast address the
	  other endpoint of the tunnel should reply as well.</para></note>

      <para>By now setting up a route to your 6bone uplink should be rather
	straightforward:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -inet6 default -interface gif0</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ping6 -n MY_UPLINK</userinput></screen>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>traceroute6 www.jp.FreeBSD.org</userinput>

      <para>To your primary zone DNS file.  In case you do not serve your own

      <programlisting>rtadvd_interfaces="fxp0"</programlisting>

      <para>Now we must create the configuration file,

      <para>Replace <filename>fxp0</filename> with the interface you

      <title>Configuring classical IP over ATM (PVCs)</title>

      <para>Classical IP over ATM (<acronym>CLIP</acronym>) is the
	simplest method to use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
	with IP.  It can be used with
	switched connections (SVCs) and with permanent connections
	(PVCs).  This section describes how to set up a network based
	on PVCs.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Fully meshed configurations</title>

	<para>The first method to set up a <acronym>CLIP</acronym> with
	  PVCs is to connect each machine to each other machine in the
	  network via a dedicated PVC.  While this is simple to
	  configure it tends to become impractical for a larger number
	  of machines.  The example supposes that we have four
	  machines in the network, each connected to the <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> network
	  with an <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> adapter card.  The first step is the planning of
	  the IP addresses and the <acronym role="Asynchronous    Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> connections between the
	  machines.  We use the following:</para>

	<para>The VPI and VCI values at each end of the connection may
	  of course differ, but for simplicity we assume that they are
	  the same.  Next we need to configure the ATM interfaces on
	  each host:</para>

	<screen>hostA&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.1 up</userinput>
hostB&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.2 up</userinput>

hostD&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.4 up</userinput></screen>

	<para>assuming that the ATM interface is
	  <filename>hatm0</filename> on all hosts.  Now the PVCs
	  need to be configured on <systemitem>hostA</systemitem> (we assume that
	  they are already configured on the ATM switches, you need to
	  consult the manual for the switch on how to do this).</para>

	<screen>hostA&prompt.root; <userinput>atmconfig natm add 192.168.173.2 hatm0 0 100 llc/snap ubr</userinput>

	<para>Of course other traffic contracts than UBR can be used
	  given the ATM adapter supports those.  In this case the name
	  of the traffic contract is followed by the parameters of the

  <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>FreeBSD supports a wide variety of sound cards, allowing you
      to enjoy high fidelity output from your computer.  This includes
      the ability to record and playback audio in the MPEG Audio Layer
      3 (MP3), WAV, and Ogg Vorbis formats as well as many other
      formats.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection also contains
      applications allowing you to edit your recorded audio, add sound
      effects, and control attached MIDI devices.</para>

    <para>With some willingness to experiment, FreeBSD can support
      playback of video files and DVD's.  The number of applications
      to encode, convert, and playback various video media is more
      limited than the number of sound applications.  For example as
      of this writing, there is no good re-encoding application in the
      FreeBSD Ports Collection, which could be use to convert
      between formats, as there is with <package>audio/sox</package>.  However, the software
      landscape in this area is changing rapidly.</para>

    <para>This chapter will describe the necessary steps to configure
      your sound card.  The configuration and installation of X11
      (<xref linkend="x11"/>) has already taken care of the
      hardware issues for your video card, though there may be some
      tweaks to apply for better playback.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>sound cards</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Before you begin, you should know the model of the card you
      have, the chip it uses, and whether it is a PCI or ISA card.
      FreeBSD supports a wide variety of both PCI and ISA cards.
      Check the supported audio devices list of the <link xlink:href="&rel.current.hardware;">Hardware Notes</link> to see if
      your card is supported.  This document will also mention which
      driver supports your card.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>configuration</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>To use your sound device, you will need to load the proper
      device driver.  This may be accomplished in one of two ways.
      The easiest way is to simply load a kernel module for your sound
      card with &man.kldload.8; which can either be done from the
      command line:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload snd_emu10k1</userinput></screen>

    <para>or by adding the appropriate line to the file
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> like this:</para>

    <programlisting>snd_emu10k1_load="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>These examples are for a Creative &soundblaster; Live! sound
      card.  Other available loadable sound modules are listed in
      <filename>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</filename>.
      If you are not sure which driver to use, you may try to load
      the <filename>snd_driver</filename> module:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload snd_driver</userinput></screen>

    <para>This is a metadriver loading the most common device drivers
      at once.  This speeds up the search for the correct driver.  It
      is also possible to load all sound drivers via the
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> facility.</para>

    <para>If you wish to find out the driver selected for your
      soundcard after loading the <filename>snd_driver</filename>
      metadriver, you may check the <filename>/dev/sndstat</filename>
      file with the <command>cat /dev/sndstat</command>
      command.</para>

    <para>A second method is to statically
      compile in support for your sound card in your kernel.  The
      section below provides the information you need to add support
      for your hardware in this manner.  For more information about
      recompiling your kernel, please see <xref linkend="kernelconfig"/>.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Configuring a Custom Kernel with Sound Support</title>

      <para>The first thing to do is adding the generic audio driver
	&man.sound.4; to the kernel, for that you will need to
	add the following line to the kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>device sound</programlisting>

      <para>Then we have to add the support for our sound card.
	Therefore, we need to know which driver supports the card.
	Check the supported audio devices list of the <link xlink:href="&rel.current.hardware;">Hardware Notes</link>, to
	determine the correct driver for your sound card.  For
	example, a Creative &soundblaster; Live! sound card is
	supported by the &man.snd.emu10k1.4; driver.  To add the support
	for this card, use the following:</para>

      <programlisting>device snd_emu10k1</programlisting>

      <para>Be sure to read the manual page of the driver for the
	syntax to use.  Information regarding the syntax of sound
	drivers in the kernel configuration can also be found in the
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> file.</para>

      <para>Non-PnP ISA cards may require you to provide the kernel
	with information on the sound card settings (IRQ, I/O port,
	etc).  This is done via the
	<filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file.  At system boot,
	the &man.loader.8; will read this file and pass the settings
	to the kernel.  For example, an old
	Creative &soundblaster; 16 ISA non-PnP card will use the
	&man.snd.sbc.4; driver in conjunction with snd_sb16(4).  For this card the following lines have to be added to
	the kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>device snd_sbc
device snd_sb16</programlisting>

      <para>as well as the following in
	<filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>hint.sbc.0.at="isa"
hint.sbc.0.port="0x220"
hint.sbc.0.irq="5"
hint.sbc.0.drq="1"
hint.sbc.0.flags="0x15"</programlisting>

      <para>In this case, the card uses the <literal>0x220</literal>
	I/O port and the IRQ <literal>5</literal>.</para>

      <para>The syntax used in the
	<filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file is covered in the
	sound driver manual page.  On &os;&nbsp;4.X, these settings
	are directly written in the kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>The settings shown above are the defaults.  In some
	cases, you may need to change the IRQ or the other settings to
	match your card.  See the &man.snd.sbc.4; manual page for more
	information.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sound-testing">
    <title>Testing the Sound Card</title>

    <para>After rebooting with the modified kernel, or after loading
      the required module, the sound card should appear in your system
      message buffer (&man.dmesg.8;) as something like:</para>

    <screen>pcm0: &lt;Intel ICH3 (82801CA)&gt; port 0xdc80-0xdcbf,0xd800-0xd8ff irq 5 at device 31.5 on pci0
pcm0: [GIANT-LOCKED]
pcm0: &lt;Cirrus Logic CS4205 AC97 Codec&gt;</screen>

    <para>The status of the sound card may be checked via the
      <filename>/dev/sndstat</filename> file:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cat /dev/sndstat</userinput>
FreeBSD Audio Driver (newpcm)
Installed devices:
pcm0: &lt;Intel ICH3 (82801CA)&gt; at io 0xd800, 0xdc80 irq 5 bufsz 16384
kld snd_ich (1p/2r/0v channels duplex default)</screen>

    <para>The output from your system may vary.  If no
      <filename>pcm</filename> devices show up, go back and review
      what was done earlier.  Go through your kernel
      configuration file again and make sure the correct
      device is chosen.  Common problems are listed in <xref linkend="troubleshooting"/>.</para>

    <para>If all goes well, you should now have a functioning sound
      card.  If your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is properly coupled to
      your sound card, you can put a CD in the drive and play it
      with &man.cdcontrol.1;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cdcontrol -f /dev/acd0 play 1</userinput></screen>

    <para>Various applications, such as <package>audio/workman</package> can provide a friendlier
      interface.  You may want to install an application such as
      <package>audio/mpg123</package> to listen to
      MP3 audio files.  A quick way to test the card is sending data
      to the <filename>/dev/dsp</filename>, like this:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cat filename &gt; /dev/dsp</userinput></screen>

    <para>where <replaceable>filename</replaceable> can be any file.
      This command line should produce some noise, confirming the
      sound card is actually working.</para>

    <para>Sound card mixer levels can be changed via the &man.mixer.8;
      command.  More details can be found in the &man.mixer.8; manual
      page.</para>

    </info>
    

    <para>It is often desirable to have multiple sources of sound that
      are able to play simultaneously, such as when
      <application>esound</application> or
      <application>artsd</application> do not support sharing of the
      sound device with a certain application.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD lets you do this through <emphasis>Virtual Sound
      Channels</emphasis>, which can be set with the &man.sysctl.8;
      facility.  Virtual channels allow you to multiplex your sound
      card's playback channels by mixing sound in the kernel.</para>

    <para>To set the number of virtual channels, there are two sysctl
      knobs which, if you are the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, can
      be set like this:</para>
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.snd.pcm0.vchans=4</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.snd.maxautovchans=4</userinput></screen>

    <para>The above example allocates four virtual channels, which is a
      practical number for everyday use.  <varname>hw.snd.pcm0.vchans</varname>
      is the number of virtual channels <filename>pcm0</filename> has, and is configurable
      once a device has been attached.
      <literal>hw.snd.maxautovchans</literal> is the number of virtual channels
      a new audio device is given when it is attached using
      &man.kldload.8;.  Since the <filename>pcm</filename> module
      can be loaded independently of the hardware drivers,
      <varname>hw.snd.maxautovchans</varname> can store how many
      virtual channels any devices which are attached later will be
      given.</para>

    <note>
      <para>You cannot change the number of virtual channels for a
	device while it is in use.  First close any programs using the
	device, such as music players or sound daemons.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If you are not using &man.devfs.5;, you will have to point
      your applications at
      <filename>/dev/dsp0</filename>.<replaceable>x</replaceable>,
      where <replaceable>x</replaceable> is 0 to 3 if
      <varname>hw.snd.pcm.0.vchans</varname> is set to 4 as in the
      above example.  On a system using &man.devfs.5;, the above will
      automatically be allocated transparently to the user.</para>

      <para>This is only supported in &os; 5.3-RELEASE and later.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The default values for the different mixer channels are
      hardcoded in the sourcecode of the &man.pcm.4; driver.  There are
      a lot of different applications and daemons that allow
      you to set values for the mixer they remember and set
      each time they are started, but this is not a clean
      solution, we want to have default values at the driver
      level.  This is accomplished by defining the appropriate
      values in <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>. E.g.:</para>
<programlisting>hint.pcm.0.vol="100"</programlisting>

    <para>This will set the volume channel to a default value of
      100, when the &man.pcm.4; module is loaded.</para>

    <para>Video playback is a very new and rapidly developing application
      area.  Be patient.  Not everything is going to work as smoothly as
      it did with sound.</para>

    <para>Before you begin, you should know the model of the video
      card you have and the chip it uses.  While <application>&xorg;</application> and <application>&xfree86;</application> support a
      wide variety of video cards, fewer give good playback
      performance.  To obtain a list of extensions supported by the
      X server using your card use the command &man.xdpyinfo.1; while
      X11 is running.</para>

    <para>It is a good idea to have a short MPEG file which can be
      treated as a test file for evaluating various players and
      options.  Since some DVD players will look for DVD media in
      <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> by default, or have this device
      name hardcoded in them, you might find it useful to make
      symbolic links to the proper devices:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0c /dev/dvd</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/racd0c /dev/rdvd</userinput></screen>

    <para>On FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X, which uses &man.devfs.5; there
        is a slightly different set of recommended links:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0 /dev/dvd</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0 /dev/rdvd</userinput></screen>

    <para>Note that due to the nature of &man.devfs.5;,
      manually created links like these will not persist if you reboot
      your system.  In order to create the symbolic links
      automatically whenever you boot your system, add the following
      lines to <filename>/etc/devfs.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>link acd0 dvd
link acd0 rdvd</programlisting>

    <para>Additionally, DVD decryption, which requires invoking
      special DVD-ROM functions, requires write permission on the DVD
      devices.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel options</primary>
      <secondary>CPU_ENABLE_SSE</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Some of the ports discussed rely on the following kernel
      options to build correctly.  Before attempting to build, add
      this option to the kernel configuration file, build a new kernel, and reboot:</para>

      <programlisting>options CPU_ENABLE_SSE</programlisting>

    <para>To enhance the shared memory X11 interface, it is
      recommended that the values of some &man.sysctl.8; variables
      should be increased:</para>

      <programlisting>kern.ipc.shmmax=67108864
kern.ipc.shmall=32768</programlisting>

    <para>This section discusses the software available from the
      FreeBSD Ports Collection which can be used for video playback.
      Video playback is a very active area of software development,
      and the capabilities of various applications are bound to
      diverge somewhat from the descriptions given here.</para>

    <para>Firstly, it is important to know that many of the video
      applications which run on FreeBSD were developed as Linux
      applications.  Many of these applications are still
      beta-quality.  Some of the problems that you may encounter with
      video packages on FreeBSD include:</para>

      <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>An application cannot playback a file which another
          application produced.</para>
      </listitem>

        <para>An application cannot playback a file which the
          application itself produced.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>The same application on two different machines,
          rebuilt on each machine for that machine, plays back the same
          file differently.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A seemingly trivial filter like rescaling of the image
          size results in very bad artifacts from a buggy rescaling
          routine.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An application frequently dumps core.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Documentation is not installed with the port and can be
          found either on the web or under the port's <filename>work</filename>
          directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      </orderedlist>

    <para>Many of these applications may also exhibit
      <quote>Linux-isms</quote>.  That is, there may be
      issues resulting from the way some standard libraries are
      implemented in the Linux distributions, or some features of the
      Linux kernel which have been assumed by the authors of the
      applications.  These issues are not always noticed and worked around
      by the port maintainers, which can lead to problems like
      these:</para>

      <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>The use of <filename>/proc/cpuinfo</filename> to detect
          processor characteristics.</para>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>So far, these application developers have been cooperative with
        port maintainers to minimize the work-arounds needed for
        port-ing.</para>

    <sect3 xml:id="video-mplayer">
      <title>MPlayer</title>

      <para><application>MPlayer</application> is a recently developed and rapidly developing
        video player.  The goals of the <application>MPlayer</application> team are speed and
        flexibility on Linux and other Unices.  The project was
        started when the team founder got fed up with bad playback
        performance on then available players.  Some would say that
        the graphical interface has been sacrificed for a streamlined
        design.  However, once
        you get used to the command line options and the key-stroke
        controls, it works very well.</para>

        <title>Building MPlayer</title>
        <indexterm><primary>MPlayer</primary>
	           <secondary>making</secondary></indexterm>

	<para><application>MPlayer</application> resides in <package>multimedia/mplayer</package>.
	  <application>MPlayer</application> performs a variety of
	  hardware checks during the build process, resulting in a
	  binary which will not be portable from one system to
	  another.  Therefore, it is important to build it from
	  ports and not to use a binary package.  Additionally, a
	  number of options can be specified in the <command>make</command>
	  command line, as described in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and at the start of the build:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>
N - O - T - E

Take a careful look into the Makefile in order
to learn how to tune mplayer towards you personal preferences!
For example,
make WITH_GTK1
builds MPlayer with GTK1-GUI support.
If you want to use the GUI, you can either install
/usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer-skins
or download official skin collections from
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/dload.html
</screen>

	<para>The default port options should be sufficient for most
	  users.  However, if you need the XviD codec, you have to
	  specify the <varname>WITH_XVID</varname> option in the
	  command line.  The default DVD device can also be defined
	  with the <varname>WITH_DVD_DEVICE</varname> option, by
	  default <filename>/dev/acd0</filename> will be used.</para>

        <para>As of this writing, the <application>MPlayer</application> port will build its HTML
          documentation and two executables,
          <command>mplayer</command>, and
          <command>mencoder</command>, which is a tool for
          re-encoding video.</para>

        <para>The HTML documentation for <application>MPlayer</application> is very informative.
          If the reader finds the information on video hardware and
          interfaces in this chapter lacking, the <application>MPlayer</application> documentation
          is a very thorough supplement.  You should definitely take
          the time to read the <application>MPlayer</application>
          documentation if you are looking for information about video
          support in &unix;.</para>

        <para>Any user of <application>MPlayer</application> must set up a
          <filename>.mplayer</filename> subdirectory of her
          home directory.  To create this necessary subdirectory,
	  you can type the following:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make install-user</userinput></screen>

	<para>The command options for <command>mplayer</command> are

	  common uses.</para>

	<para>To play a file, such as
	  <filename>testfile.avi</filename>,
	  through one of the various video interfaces set the

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -vo 'sdl:dga' testfile.avi</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is worth trying all of these options, as their relative
	  performance depends on many factors and will vary significantly
	  with hardware.</para>

	<para>To play from a DVD, replace the
	 <filename>testfile.avi</filename> with <option>dvd://<replaceable>N</replaceable> -dvd-device
	 <replaceable>DEVICE</replaceable></option> where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is
	 the title number to play and

	 from <filename>/dev/dvd</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -vo xv dvd://3 -dvd-device /dev/dvd</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>The default DVD device can be defined during the build
	    of the <application>MPlayer</application> port via the
	    <varname>WITH_DVD_DEVICE</varname> option.  By default,
	    this device is <filename>/dev/acd0</filename>.  More
	    details can be found in the port
	    <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>
	</note>

	<para>To stop, pause, advance and so on, consult the
	  keybindings, which are output by running <command>mplayer
	  -h</command> or read the manual page.</para>

        <para>Additional important options for playback are:
          <option>-fs -zoom</option> which engages the fullscreen mode
          and <option>-framedrop</option> which helps performance.</para>

	<para>In order for the mplayer command line to not become too
	  large, the user can create a file
	  <filename>.mplayer/config</filename> and set default options
	  there:</para>
<programlisting>vo=xv
fs=yes
zoom=yes</programlisting>

	<para>Finally, <command>mplayer</command> can be used to rip a
	  DVD title into a <filename>.vob</filename> file.  To dump

	<para>Before using
         <command>mencoder</command> it is a good idea to
	 familiarize yourself with the options from the HTML
	 documentation.  There is a manual page, but it is not very
	 useful without the HTML documentation.  There are innumerable ways to
	 improve quality, lower bitrate, and change formats, and some
	 of these tricks may make the difference between good
	 or bad performance.  Here are a couple of examples to get
	 you going.  First a simple copy:</para>

	 <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mencoder input.avi -oac copy -ovc copy -o output.avi</userinput></screen>

         <para>Improper combinations of command line options can yield
	 output files that are
	 unplayable even by <command>mplayer</command>.  Thus, if you
	 just want to rip to a file, stick to the <option>-dumpfile</option>
	 in <command>mplayer</command>.</para>

	 <para>To convert <filename>input.avi</filename> to the MPEG4
	 codec with MPEG3 audio encoding (<package>audio/lame</package> is required):</para>

	 <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mencoder input.avi -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=192 \
	 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq -o output.avi</userinput></screen>

	 <para>This has produced output playable by <command>mplayer</command>
	 and <command>xine</command>.</para>

	 <para><filename>input.avi</filename> can be replaced with
	   <option>dvd://1 -dvd-device /dev/dvd</option> and run as
	   <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> to re-encode a DVD title
	   directly.  Since you are likely to be dissatisfied with
	   your results the first time around, it is recommended you
	   dump the title to a file and work on the file.</para>

    <title>The xine Video Player</title>

    <para>The <application>xine</application> video player is a project of wide scope aiming not only at being an
     all in one video solution, but also in producing a reusable base
     library and a modular executable which can be extended with
     plugins.  It comes both as a package and as a port, <package>multimedia/xine</package>.</para>

    <para>The <application>xine</application> player
     is still very rough around the edges, but it is clearly off to a
     good start.  In practice, <application>xine</application> requires either a fast CPU with a
     fast video card, or support for the XVideo extension.  The GUI is
     usable, but a bit clumsy.</para>

    <para>As of this writing, there is no input module shipped with
     <application>xine</application> which will play CSS encoded DVD's.  There are third party
     builds which do have modules for this built in them, but none
     of these are in the FreeBSD Ports Collection.</para>

    <para>Compared to <application>MPlayer</application>, <application>xine</application> does more for the user, but at the
      same time, takes some of the more fine-grained control away from
      the user.  The <application>xine</application> video player
      performs best on XVideo interfaces.</para>

    <para>By default, <application>xine</application> player will
    start up in a graphical user interface.  The menus can then be
    used to open a specific file:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xine</userinput></screen>

    <para>Alternatively, it may be invoked to play a file immediately

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>TV cards allow you to watch broadcast or cable TV on your
	computer.  Most of them accept composite video via an RCA or
	S-video input and some of these cards come with a FM
	radio tuner.</para>

      <para>&os; provides support for PCI-based TV cards using a
	Brooktree Bt848/849/878/879 or a Conexant CN-878/Fusion 878a
	Video Capture Chip with the &man.bktr.4; driver.  You must
	also ensure the board comes with a supported tuner, consult
	the &man.bktr.4; manual page for a list of supported
	tuners.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Adding the Driver</title>

      <para>To use your card, you will need to load the &man.bktr.4;
	driver, this can be done by adding the following line to the
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file like this:</para>

      <programlisting>bktr_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, you may statically compile the support for
	the TV card in your kernel, in that case add the following
	lines to your kernel configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>device	 bktr
device	iicbus
device	iicbb
device	smbus</programlisting>

      <para>These additional device drivers are necessary because of the
	card components being interconnected via an I2C bus.  Then build
	and install a new kernel.</para>

      <para>Once the support was added to your system, you have to
	reboot your machine.  During the boot process, your TV card
	should show up, like this:</para>

      <programlisting>bktr0: &lt;BrookTree 848A&gt; mem 0xd7000000-0xd7000fff irq 10 at device 10.0 on pci0
iicbb0: &lt;I2C bit-banging driver&gt; on bti2c0
iicbus0: &lt;Philips I2C bus&gt; on iicbb0 master-only
iicbus1: &lt;Philips I2C bus&gt; on iicbb0 master-only
smbus0: &lt;System Management Bus&gt; on bti2c0
bktr0: Pinnacle/Miro TV, Philips SECAM tuner.</programlisting>

      <para>Of course these messages can differ according to your
	hardware.  However you should check if the tuner is correctly
	detected; it is still possible to override some of the
	detected parameters with &man.sysctl.8; MIBs and kernel
	configuration file options.  For example, if you want to force
	the tuner to a Philips SECAM tuner, you should add the
	following line to your kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>options OVERRIDE_TUNER=6</programlisting>

      <para>or you can directly use &man.sysctl.8;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.bt848.tuner=6</userinput></screen>

      <para>See the &man.bktr.4; manual page and the
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> file for more
	details on the available options.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <para>If you encounter any problem with your TV card, you should
	check at first if the video capture chip and the tuner are
	really supported by the &man.bktr.4; driver and if you used the right
	configuration options.  For more support and various questions
	about your TV card you may want to contact and use the

    </indexterm>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>&os;, like any modern operating system, allows the use of
	image scanners.  Standardized access to scanners is provided
	by the <application>SANE</application> (Scanner Access Now
	Easy) <acronym role="Application Programming  Interface">API</acronym> available through the &os; Ports
	Collection.  <application>SANE</application> will also use
	some &os; devices drivers to access to the scanner
	hardware.</para>

      <para>&os; supports both SCSI and USB scanners.  Be sure your
	scanner is supported by <application>SANE</application> prior
	to performing any configuration.
	<application>SANE</application> has a <link xlink:href="http://sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">supported
	devices</link> list that can provide you with information
	about the support for a scanner and its status.  The
	&man.uscanner.4; manual page also provides a list of supported
	USB scanners.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

      <para>As mentioned above both SCSI and USB interfaces are
	supported.  According to your scanner interface, different
	device drivers are required.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="scanners-kernel-usb">
	<title>USB Interface</title>

	<para>The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by default
	  includes the device drivers needed to support USB scanners.
	  Should you decide to use a custom kernel, be sure that the
	  following lines are present in your kernel configuration
	  file:</para>

	<programlisting>device usb
device uhci
device ohci
device uscanner</programlisting>

	<para>Depending upon the USB chipset on your motherboard, you
	  will only need either <literal>device uhci</literal> or
	  <literal>device ohci</literal>, however having both in the
	  kernel configuration file is harmless.</para>

	<para>If you do not want to rebuild your kernel and your
	  kernel is not the <filename>GENERIC</filename> one, you can
	  directly load the &man.uscanner.4; device driver module with
	  the &man.kldload.8; command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload uscanner</userinput></screen>

	<para>To load this module at each system startup, add the
	  following line to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>uscanner_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>After rebooting with the correct kernel, or after
	  loading the required module, plug in your USB scanner.  The
	  scanner should appear in your system message buffer
	  (&man.dmesg.8;) as something like:</para>

	<screen>uscanner0: EPSON EPSON Scanner, rev 1.10/3.02, addr 2</screen>

	<para>This shows that our scanner is using the
	  <filename>/dev/uscanner0</filename> device node.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>SCSI Interface</title>

	<para>If your scanner comes with a SCSI interface, it is
	  important to know which SCSI controller board you will use.
	  According to the SCSI chipset used, you will have to tune
	  your kernel configuration file.  The
	  <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel supports the most common
	  SCSI controllers.  Be sure to read the
	  <filename>NOTES</filename> file
	  and add the correct line to your kernel
	  configuration file.  In addition to the SCSI adapter driver,
	  you need to have the following lines in your kernel
	  configuration file:</para>

	<programlisting>device scbus
device pass</programlisting>

	<para>Once your kernel has been properly compiled, you should
	  be able to see the devices in your system message buffer,
	  when booting:</para>

	<screen>pass2 at aic0 bus 0 target 2 lun 0
pass2: &lt;AGFA SNAPSCAN 600 1.10&gt; Fixed Scanner SCSI-2 device
pass2: 3.300MB/s transfers</screen>

	<para>If your scanner was not powered-on at system boot, it is
	  still possible to manually force the detection by performing
	  a SCSI bus scan with the &man.camcontrol.8; command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>camcontrol rescan all</userinput>
Re-scan of bus 0 was successful
Re-scan of bus 1 was successful
Re-scan of bus 2 was successful
Re-scan of bus 3 was successful</screen>

	<para>Then the scanner will appear in the SCSI devices
	  list:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>camcontrol devlist</userinput>
&lt;IBM DDRS-34560 S97B&gt;              at scbus0 target 5 lun 0 (pass0,da0)
&lt;IBM DDRS-34560 S97B&gt;              at scbus0 target 6 lun 0 (pass1,da1)
&lt;AGFA SNAPSCAN 600 1.10&gt;           at scbus1 target 2 lun 0 (pass3)
&lt;PHILIPS CDD3610 CD-R/RW 1.00&gt;     at scbus2 target 0 lun 0 (pass2,cd0)</screen>

	<para>More details about SCSI devices, are available in the
	  &man.scsi.4; and &man.camcontrol.8; manual pages.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>SANE Configuration</title>

      <para>The <application>SANE</application> system has been
	splitted in two parts: the backends (<package>graphics/sane-backends</package>) and the
	frontends (<package>graphics/sane-frontends</package>).  The
	backends part provides access to the scanner itself.  The
	<application>SANE</application>'s <link xlink:href="http://sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">supported
	devices</link> list specifies which backend will support your
	image scanner.  It is mandatory to determine the correct
	backend for your scanner if you want to be able to use your
	device.  The frontends part provides the graphical scanning
	interface (<application>xscanimage</application>).</para>

      <para>The first thing to do is install the <package>graphics/sane-backends</package> port or
	package.  Then, use the <command>sane-find-scanner</command>
	command to check the scanner detection by the
	<application>SANE</application> system:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sane-find-scanner -q</userinput>
found SCSI scanner "AGFA SNAPSCAN 600 1.10" at /dev/pass3</screen>

      <para>The output will show the interface type of the scanner and
	the device node used to attach the scanner to the system.  The
	vendor and the product model may not appear, it is not
	important.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Some USB scanners require you to load a firmware, this
	  is explained in the backend manual page.  You should also read
	  &man.sane-find-scanner.1; and &man.sane.7; manual
	  pages.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Now we have to check if the scanner will be identified by
	a scanning frontend.  By default, the
	<application>SANE</application> backends comes with a command
	line tool called &man.scanimage.1;.  This command allows you
	to list the devices and to perform an image acquisition from
	the command line.  The <option>-L</option> option is used to
	list the scanner device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>scanimage -L</userinput>
device `snapscan:/dev/pass3' is a AGFA SNAPSCAN 600 flatbed scanner</screen>

      <para>No output or a message saying that no scanners were
	identified indicates that &man.scanimage.1; is unable to
	identify the scanner.  If this happens, you will need to edit
	the backend configuration file and define the scanner device
	used.  The <filename>/usr/local/etc/sane.d/</filename> directory
	contains all backends configuration files.  This
	identification problem does appear with certain USB
	scanners.</para>

      <para>For example, with the USB scanner used in the <xref linkend="scanners-kernel-usb"/>,
	<command>sane-find-scanner</command> gives us the following
	information:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sane-find-scanner -q</userinput>
found USB scanner (UNKNOWN vendor and product) at device /dev/uscanner0</screen>
      <para>The scanner is correctly detected, it uses the USB
	interface and is attached to the
	<filename>/dev/uscanner0</filename> device node.  We can now
	check if the scanner is correctly identified:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>scanimage -L</userinput>

No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
sane-find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation
which came with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).</screen>

      <para>Since the scanner is not identified, we will need to edit
	the <filename>/usr/local/etc/sane.d/epson.conf</filename>
	file.  The scanner model used was the &epson.perfection; 1650,
	so we know the scanner will use the <literal>epson</literal>
	backend.  Be sure to read the help comments in the backends
	configuration files.  Line changes are quite simple: comment
	out all lines that have the wrong interface for your scanner
	(in our case, we will comment out all lines starting with the
	word <literal>scsi</literal> as our scanner uses the USB
	interface), then add at the end of the file a line specifying
	the interface and the device node used.  In this case, we add
	the following line:</para>

      <programlisting>usb /dev/uscanner0</programlisting>

      <para>Please be sure to read the comments provided in the
	backend configuration file as well as the backend manual page
	for more details and correct syntax to use.  We can now verify
	if the scanner is identified:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>scanimage -L</userinput>
device `epson:/dev/uscanner0' is a Epson GT-8200 flatbed scanner</screen>

      <para>Our USB scanner has been identified.  It is not important
	if the brand and the model do not match.  The key item to be
	concerned with is the
	<literal>`epson:/dev/uscanner0'</literal> field, which give us
	the right backend name and the right device node.</para>

      <para>Once the <command>scanimage -L</command> command is able
	to see the scanner, the configuration is complete.  The device
	is now ready to scan.</para>

      <para>While &man.scanimage.1; does allow us to perform an
	image acquisition from the command line, it is preferable to
	use a graphical user interface to perform image scanning.
	<application>SANE</application> offers a simple but efficient
	graphical interface: <application>xscanimage</application>
	(<package>graphics/sane-frontends</package>).</para>

      <para><application>Xsane</application> (<package>graphics/xsane</package>) is another popular
	graphical scanning frontend.  This frontend offers advanced
	features such as various scanning mode (photocopy, fax, etc.),
	color correction, batch scans, etc.  Both of these applications
	are useable as a <application>GIMP</application>
	plugin.</para>

	other users to have access
	to the scanner.  The user will need read and write
	permissions to the device node used by the scanner.  As an
	example, our USB scanner uses the device node
	<filename>/dev/uscanner0</filename> which is owned by the
	<systemitem class="groupname">operator</systemitem> group.  Adding the user
	<systemitem class="username">joe</systemitem> to the
	<systemitem class="groupname">operator</systemitem> group will allow him to use
	the scanner:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod operator -m joe</userinput></screen>

      <para>For more details read the &man.pw.8; manual page.  You
	also have to set the correct write permissions (0660 or 0664)
	on the <filename>/dev/uscanner0</filename> device node, by
	default the <systemitem class="groupname">operator</systemitem> group can only
	read the device node.  This is done by adding the following
	lines to the <filename>/etc/devfs.rules</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>[system=5]
add path uscanner0 mode 660</programlisting>

      <para>Then add the following to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and reboot the
	machine:</para>

      <programlisting>devfs_system_ruleset="system"</programlisting>

      <para>More information regarding these lines can be found in the
	&man.devfs.8; manual page.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Of course, for security reasons, you should think twice
	  before adding a user to any group, especially the
	  <systemitem class="groupname">operator</systemitem> group.</para>

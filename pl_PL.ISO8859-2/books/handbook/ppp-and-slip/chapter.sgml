    <para>FreeBSD has a number of ways to link one computer to
      another.  To establish a network or Internet connection through a
      dial-up modem, or to allow others to do so through you, requires
      the use of PPP or SLIP.  This chapter describes setting up
      these modem-based communication services in detail.</para>

    <para>Before reading this chapter, you should:</para>

	<para>Be familiar with basic network terminology.</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>Understand the basics and purpose of a dialup connection
	  and PPP and/or SLIP.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>You may be wondering what the main difference is between user
      PPP and kernel PPP.  The answer is simple: user PPP processes the
      inbound and outbound data in userland rather than in the kernel.
      This is expensive in terms of copying the data between the kernel
      and userland, but allows a far more feature-rich PPP implementation.
      User PPP uses the <devicename>tun</devicename> device to communicate
      with the outside world whereas kernel PPP uses the
      <devicename>ppp</devicename> device.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Throughout in this chapter, user PPP will simply be
	referred to as <application>ppp</application> unless a distinction needs to be made between it
	and any other PPP software such as <application>pppd</application>.
	Unless otherwise stated, all of the commands explained in this
	chapter should be executed as <username>root</username>.</para>

      <title>Setting Up Kernel PPP</title>
      <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary><secondary>kernel PPP</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>Before you start setting up PPP on your machine, make sure
	that <command>pppd</command> is located in
	<filename>/usr/sbin</filename> and the directory
	<filename>/etc/ppp</filename> exists.</para>

      <para><command>pppd</command> can work in two modes:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>As a <quote>client</quote> &mdash; you want to connect your
	    machine to the outside world via a PPP serial connection or
	    modem line.</para>
	</listitem>

        <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary><secondary>server</secondary></indexterm>
	<listitem>
	  <para>As a <quote>server</quote> &mdash; your machine is located on
	    the network, and is used to connect other computers using
	    PPP.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>In both cases you will need to set up an options file
        (<filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename> or
	<filename>~/.ppprc</filename> if you have more than one user on
	your machine that uses PPP).</para>

      <para>You will also need some modem/serial software (preferably
	<filename role="package">comms/kermit</filename>), so you can dial and
	establish a connection with the remote host.</para>

    <title>Troubleshooting <acronym>PPP</acronym> Connections</title>

    <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary><secondary>troubleshooting</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>This section covers a few issues which may arise when
	using PPP over a modem connection.  For instance, perhaps you
	need to know exactly what prompts the system you are dialing
	into will present.  Some <acronym>ISP</acronym>s present the
	<literal>ssword</literal> prompt, and others will present
	<literal>password</literal>; if the <command>ppp</command>
	script is not written accordingly, the login attempt will
	fail.  The most common way to debug <command>ppp</command>
	connections is by connecting manually.  The following
	information will walk you through a manual connection step by
	step.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Check the Device Nodes</title>

	<para>If you reconfigured your kernel then you recall the
	  <devicename>sio</devicename> device.  If you did not
	  configure your kernel, there is no reason to worry.  Just
	  check the <command>dmesg</command> output for the modem
	  device with:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dmesg | grep sio</userinput></screen>

	<para>You should get some pertinent output about the
	  <devicename>sio</devicename> devices.  These are the COM
	  ports we need.  If your modem acts like a standard serial
	  port then you should see it listed on
	  <devicename>sio1</devicename>, or <devicename>COM2</devicename>.  If so, you are not
	  required to rebuild the kernel.
	  When matching up sio modem is on <devicename>sio1</devicename> or
          <devicename>COM2</devicename> if you are in DOS, then your
	  modem device would be <filename>/dev/cuaa1</filename>.</para>

      <title>Connecting Manually</title>

      <para>Connecting to the Internet by manually controlling
	<command>ppp</command> is quick, easy, and a great way to
	debug a connection or just get information on how your
	<acronym>ISP</acronym> treats <command>ppp</command> client
	connections.  Lets start <application>PPP</application> from
	the command line.  Note that in all of our examples we will

      <screen>ISP Pass:<userinput>mypassword</userinput></screen>

      <para>This time we are prompted for a password, just

	&os;, the password will not echo.</para>

      <screen>Shell or PPP:<userinput>ppp</userinput></screen>

      <para>Depending on your <acronym>ISP</acronym> this prompt
	may never appear.  Here we are being asked if we wish to
	use a shell on the provider, or to start
	<command>ppp</command>.  In this example, we have chosen
	to use <command>ppp</command> as we want an Internet
	connection.</para>

      <screen>Ppp ON example&gt;</screen>

      <para>Notice that in this example the first <option>p</option>
	has been capitalized.  This shows that we have successfully
	connected to the <acronym>ISP</acronym>.</para>

      <screen>PPp ON example&gt;</screen>

      <para>We have successfully authenticated with our

	address and successfully completed our connection.</para>

      <screen>PPP ON example&gt;<userinput>add default HISADDR</userinput></screen>

      <para>Here we add our default route, we need to do this before
	we can talk to the outside world as currently the only
	established connection is with the peer.  If this fails due to
	existing routes you can put a bang character
	<literal>!</literal> in front of the <option>add</option>.
	Alternatively, you can set this before making the actual
	connection and it will negotiate a new route
	accordingly.</para>

      <para>If everything went good we should now have an active
	connection to the Internet, which could be thrown into the
	background using <keycombo
	action="simul"><keycap>CTRL</keycap>
	<keycap>z</keycap></keycombo> If you notice the
	<command>PPP</command> return to <command>ppp</command> then
	we have lost our connection.  This is good to know because it
	shows our connection status.  Capital P's show that we have a
	connection to the <acronym>ISP</acronym> and lowercase p's
	show that the connection has been lost for whatever reason.
	<command>ppp</command> only has these 2 states.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Debugging</title>

	<para>If you have a direct line and cannot seem to make a
	  connection, then turn hardware flow
	  <acronym>CTS/RTS</acronym> to off with the <option>set
	  ctsrts off</option>.  This is mainly the case if you are
	  connected to some <application>PPP</application> capable
	  terminal servers, where <application>PPP</application> hangs
	  when it tries to write data to your communication link, so
	  it would be waiting for a <acronym>CTS</acronym>, or Clear
	  To Send signal which may never come.  If you use this option
	  however, you should also use the <option>set accmap</option>
	  option, which may be required to defeat hardware dependent
	  on passing certain characters from end to end, most of the
	  time XON/XOFF.  See the &man.ppp.8; manual page for more
	  information on this option, and how it is used.</para>

	<para>If you have an older modem, you may need to use the
	  <option>set parity even</option>.  Parity is set at none
	  be default, but is used for error checking (with a large
	  increase in traffic) on older modems and some
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym>s.  You may need this option for
	  the Compuserve <acronym>ISP</acronym>.</para>

	<para><application>PPP</application> may not return to the
	  command mode, which is usually a negotiation error where
	  the <acronym>ISP</acronym> is waiting for your side to start
	  negotiating.  At this point, using the <command>~p</command>
	  command will force ppp to start sending the configuration
	  information.</para>

	<para>If you never obtain a login prompt, then most likely you
	  need to use <acronym>PAP</acronym> or
	  <acronym>CHAP</acronym> authentication instead of the
	  &unix; style in the example above.  To use
	  <acronym>PAP</acronym> or <acronym>CHAP</acronym> just add
	  the following options to <application>PPP</application>
	  before going into terminal mode:</para>

	<screen>ppp ON example&gt; <userinput>set authname <replaceable>myusername</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>Where <replaceable>myusername</replaceable> should be
	  replaced with the username that was assigned by the
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym>.</para>

	<screen>ppp ON example&gt; <userinput>set authkey <replaceable>mypassword</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>Where <replaceable>mypassword</replaceable> should be
	  replaced with the password that was assigned by the
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym>.</para>

	<para>If you connect fine, but cannot seem to find any domain
	  name, try to use &man.ping.8; with an <acronym>IP</acronym>
	  address and see if you can get any return information.  If
	  you experience 100 percent (100%) packet loss, then it is most
	  likely that you were not assigned a default route.  Double
	  check that the option <option>add default HISADDR</option>
	  was set during the connection.  If you can connect to a
	  remote <acronym>IP</acronym> address then it is possible
	  that a resolver address has not been added to the
	  <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  This file should
	  look like:</para>

	<programlisting>domain <replaceable>example.com</replaceable>
nameserver <replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable>
nameserver <replaceable>y.y.y.y</replaceable></programlisting>

	<para>Where <replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable> and
	  <replaceable>y.y.y.y</replaceable> should be replaced with
	  the <acronym>IP</acronym> address of your
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s DNS servers.  This information may
	  or may not have been provided when you signed up, but a
	  quick call to your <acronym>ISP</acronym> should remedy
	  that.</para>

	<para>You could also have &man.syslog.3; provide a logging
	  function for your <application>PPP</application> connection.
	  Just add:</para>

	<programlisting>!ppp
*.*     /var/log/ppp.log</programlisting>

	<para>to <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>.  In most cases, this
	  functionality already exists.</para>

      <title>Using a PPPoE Service Tag</title>

      <para>Sometimes it will be necessary to use a service tag to establish
	your connection.  Service tags are used to distinguish between
	different PPPoE servers attached to a given network.</para>

      <para>You should have been given any required service tag information
	in the documentation provided by your ISP.  If you cannot locate
	it there, ask your ISP's tech support personnel.</para>

      <para>As a last resort, you could try the method suggested by the
	<ulink url="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/">Roaring Penguin
	PPPoE</ulink> program which can be found in the <link
	linkend="ports">Ports Collection</link>.  Bear in mind however,
	this may de-program your modem and render it useless, so
	think twice before doing it.  Simply install the program shipped
	with the modem by your provider.  Then, access the
	<guimenu>System</guimenu> menu from the program.  The name of your
	profile should be listed there.  It is usually
	<emphasis>ISP</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The profile name (service tag) will be used in the PPPoE
	configuration entry in <filename>ppp.conf</filename> as the provider
	part of the <command>set device</command> command (see the &man.ppp.8;
	manual page for full details).  It should look like this:</para>

      <programlisting>set device PPPoE:<replaceable>xl1</replaceable>:<replaceable>ISP</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>Do not forget to change <replaceable>xl1</replaceable>
	to the proper device for your Ethernet card.</para>
      <para>Do not forget to change <replaceable>ISP</replaceable>

    <para>The following describes how to set up PPP over ATM (PPPoA).
      PPPoA is a popular choice among European DSL providers.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using PPPoA with the Alcatel &speedtouch; USB</title>

      <para>PPPoA support for this device is supplied as a port in
	FreeBSD because the firmware is distributed under <ulink
	url="http://www.speedtouchdsl.com/disclaimer_lx.htm">Alcatel's
	license agreement</ulink> and can not be redistributed freely
	with the base system of FreeBSD.</para>

      <para>To install the software, simply use the <link
	  linkend="ports">Ports Collection</link>. Install the
	<filename role="package">net/pppoa</filename> port and follow the
	instructions provided with it.</para>

      <para>Like many USB devices, the Alcatel &speedtouch; USB needs to
        download firmware from the host computer to operate properly.
        It is possible to automate this process in &os; so that this
        transfer takes place whenever the device is plugged into a USB
        port.  The following information can be added to the
        <filename>/etc/usbd.conf</filename> file to enable this
        automatic firmware transfer.  This file must be edited as the
        <username>root</username> user.</para>

      <programlisting>device "Alcatel SpeedTouch USB"
    devname "ugen[0-9]+"
    vendor 0x06b9
    product 0x4061
    attach "/usr/local/sbin/modem_run -f /usr/local/libdata/mgmt.o"</programlisting>

     <para>To enable the USB daemon, <application>usbd</application>,
       put the following the line into
       <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

     <programlisting>usbd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

     <para>It is also possible to set up
       <application>ppp</application> to dial up at startup.  To do
       this add the following lines to
       <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Again, for this procedure
       you will need to be logged in as the <username>root</username>
       user.</para>

     <programlisting>ppp_enable="YES"
ppp_mode="ddial"
ppp_profile="adsl"</programlisting>

     <para>For this to work correctly you will need to have used the
       sample <filename>ppp.conf</filename> which is supplied with the
       <filename role="package">net/pppoa</filename> port.</para>
     
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using mpd</title>

      <para>You can use <application>mpd</application> to connect to a
        variety of services, in particular PPTP services. You can find
        <application>mpd</application> in the Ports Collection,
        <filename role="package">net/mpd</filename>.  Many ADSL modems
        require that a PPTP tunnel is created between the modem and
        computer, one such modem is the Alcatel &speedtouch;
        Home.</para>

      <para>First you must install the port, and then you can
        configure <application>mpd</application> to suit your
        requirements and provider settings. The port places a set of
        sample configuration files which are well documented in
        <filename><replaceable>PREFIX</replaceable>/etc/mpd/</filename>.
        Note here that <replaceable>PREFIX</replaceable> means the directory
        into which your ports are installed, this defaults to
        <filename>/usr/local/</filename>. A complete guide to
        configure <application>mpd</application> is available in
        HTML format once the port has been installed. It is placed in
        <filename><replaceable>PREFIX</replaceable>/share/doc/mpd/</filename>.
        Here is a sample configuration for connecting to an ADSL
        service with <application>mpd</application>. The configuration
        is spread over two files, first the
        <filename>mpd.conf</filename>:</para>

      <title>Setting Up a SLIP Client</title>
      <indexterm><primary>SLIP</primary><secondary>client</secondary></indexterm>
      <para>The following is one way to set up a FreeBSD machine for SLIP
	on a static host network.  For dynamic hostname assignments (your
	address changes each time you dial up), you probably need to
	have a more complex setup.</para>

      <para>First, determine which serial port your modem is connected to.
	Many people set up a symbolic link, such as
	<filename>/dev/modem</filename>, to point to the real device name,
	<filename>/dev/cuaaN</filename> (or <filename>/dev/cuadN</filename> under &os;&nbsp;6.X).  This allows you to
	abstract the actual device name should you ever need to move
	the modem to a different port.  It can become quite cumbersome when you
	need to fix a bunch of files in <filename>/etc</filename> and
	<filename>.kermrc</filename> files all over the system!</para>

      <note>
	<para><filename>/dev/cuaa0</filename> (or <filename>/dev/cuad0</filename> under &os;&nbsp;6.X) is
	  <devicename>COM1</devicename>, <filename>cuaa1</filename> (or <filename>/dev/cuad1</filename>) is
	  <devicename>COM2</devicename>, etc.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Make sure you have the following in your kernel configuration
	file:</para>

      <para>It is included in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, so

	<title>Quick Overview</title>

	<para>In its typical configuration, using FreeBSD as a SLIP server
	  works as follows:  a SLIP user dials up your FreeBSD SLIP Server
	  system and logs in with a special SLIP login ID that uses
	  <filename>/usr/sbin/sliplogin</filename> as the special user's
	  shell.  The <command>sliplogin</command> program browses the
	  file <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> to find a
	  matching line for the special user, and if it finds a match,
	  connects the serial line to an available SLIP interface and then
	  runs the shell script
	  <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> to configure the
	  SLIP interface.</para>

        <sect4>
	  <title>An Example of a SLIP Server Login</title>

	  <para>For example, if a SLIP user ID were
	    <username>Shelmerg</username>, <username>Shelmerg</username>'s
	    entry in <filename>/etc/master.passwd</filename> would look
	    something like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>Shelmerg:password:1964:89::0:0:Guy Helmer - SLIP:/usr/users/Shelmerg:/usr/sbin/sliplogin</programlisting>

	  <para>When <username>Shelmerg</username> logs in,
	    <command>sliplogin</command> will search
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> for a line that
	    had a matching user ID; for example, there may be a line in
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> that
	    reads:</para>

	  <programlisting>Shelmerg        dc-slip sl-helmer       0xfffffc00		  autocomp</programlisting>

	  <para><command>sliplogin</command> will find that matching line,
	    hook the serial line into the next available SLIP interface,
	    and then execute <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename>
	    like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>/etc/sliphome/slip.login 0 19200 Shelmerg dc-slip sl-helmer 0xfffffc00 autocomp</programlisting>

	  <para>If all goes well,
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> will issue an
	    <command>ifconfig</command> for the SLIP interface to which
	    <command>sliplogin</command> attached itself (SLIP interface
	    0, in the above example, which was the first parameter in the
	    list given to <filename>slip.login</filename>) to set the
	    local IP address (<hostid>dc-slip</hostid>), remote IP address
	    (<hostid>sl-helmer</hostid>), network mask for the SLIP
	    interface (<hostid role="netmask">0xfffffc00</hostid>), and
	    any additional flags (<literal>autocomp</literal>).  If
	    something goes wrong, <command>sliplogin</command> usually
	    logs good informational messages via the
	    <application>syslogd</application> daemon facility, which usually logs
	    to <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> (see the manual
	    pages for &man.syslogd.8; and &man.syslog.conf.5; and perhaps
	    check <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> to see to what
	    <application>syslogd</application> is logging and where it is
	    logging to).</para>

	<para>By default, your &os; machine will not forward packets.
	  If you want your FreeBSD SLIP Server to act as a router, you

	<para>As mentioned earlier, there are three files in the

	  which defines the SLIP users and their associated IP
	  addresses; <filename>slip.login</filename>, which usually just
	  configures the SLIP interface; and (optionally)
	  <filename>slip.logout</filename>, which undoes

	  connection is terminated.</para>

        <sect4>
	  <title><filename>slip.hosts</filename> Configuration</title>

	  <para><filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> contains

	    with the local and remote addresses and network mask of the
	    SLIP interface.</para>

	  <para>If you have decided to use the <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    method (instead of using a separate subnet for your SLIP

	  <para>The additional line in this
	    <filename>slip.login</filename>, <command>arp -s
	    &#36;5 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub</command>, creates an ARP entry
	    in the SLIP server's ARP table.  This ARP entry causes the
	    SLIP server to respond with the SLIP server's Ethernet MAC
	    address whenever another IP node on the Ethernet asks to
	    speak to the SLIP client's IP address.</para>

  	  <indexterm><primary>Ethernet</primary><secondary>MAC address</secondary></indexterm>
	  <para>When using the example above, be sure to replace the

	    your system's Ethernet card, or your <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    will definitely not work!  You can discover your SLIP server's
	    Ethernet MAC address by looking at the results of running

	  <para>This indicates that this particular system's Ethernet MAC
	    address is <hostid role="mac">00:02:c1:28:5f:4a</hostid>
	    &mdash; the periods in the Ethernet MAC address given by
	    <command>netstat -i</command> must be changed to colons and
	    leading zeros should be added to each single-digit hexadecimal
	    number to convert the address into the form that &man.arp.8;
	    desires; see the manual page on &man.arp.8; for complete
	    information on usage.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>When you create

	  <title><filename>slip.logout</filename> Configuration</title>

	  <para><filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename> is not
	    strictly needed (unless you are implementing <quote>proxy
	    ARP</quote>), but if you decide to create it, this is an
	    example of a basic

	  <para>If you are using <quote>proxy ARP</quote>, you will want to

  </indexterm>
	<para>If you are not using the <quote>proxy ARP</quote> method for
	  routing packets between your SLIP clients and the rest of your
	  network (and perhaps the Internet), you will probably 
	  have to add static routes to your closest default router(s) to
	  route your SLIP clients subnet via your SLIP server.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Static Routes</title>
	  <indexterm><primary>static routes</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>Adding static routes to your nearest default routers
	    can be troublesome (or impossible if you do not have
	    authority to do so...).  If you have a multiple-router
	    network in your organization, some routers, such as those
	    made by Cisco and Proteon, may not only need to be
	    configured with the static route to the SLIP subnet, but
	    also need to be told which static routes to tell other
	    routers about, so some expertise and
	    troubleshooting/tweaking may be necessary to get
	    static-route-based routing to work.</para>

	<note>
	  <para><application>&gated;</application> is proprietary software now and 
	    will not be available as source code to the public anymore 
	    (more info on the <ulink

	    section only exists to ensure backwards compatibility for
	    those that are still using an older version.</para>
	</note>

	  <para>An alternative to the headaches of static routes is to
	    install <application>&gated;</application> on your FreeBSD SLIP server
	    and configure it to use the appropriate routing protocols
	    (RIP/OSPF/BGP/EGP) to tell other routers about your SLIP
	    subnet.  
	    You will need to write a <filename>/etc/gated.conf</filename>
	    file to configure your <application>&gated;</application>; here is a sample, similar to
	    what the author used on a FreeBSD SLIP server:</para>

	  <programlisting>#
# gated configuration file for dc.dsu.edu; for gated version 3.5alpha5
# Only broadcast RIP information for xxx.xxx.yy out the ed Ethernet interface
#
#
# tracing options
#
traceoptions "/var/tmp/gated.output" replace size 100k files 2 general ;

rip yes {
  interface sl noripout noripin ;
  interface ed ripin ripout version 1 ;
  traceoptions route ;
} ;

#
# Turn on a bunch of tracing info for the interface to the kernel:
kernel {
  traceoptions remnants request routes info interface ;
} ;

#
# Propagate the route to xxx.xxx.yy out the Ethernet interface via RIP
#

export proto rip interface ed {
  proto direct {
      <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable> mask 255.255.252.0 metric 1; # SLIP connections
  } ;
} ;

#
# Accept routes from RIP via ed Ethernet interfaces
	      
import proto rip interface ed {
  all ;
} ;</programlisting>

          <indexterm><primary>RIP</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>The above sample <filename>gated.conf</filename> file
	    broadcasts routing information regarding the SLIP subnet
	    <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable> via RIP onto the
	    Ethernet; if you are using a different Ethernet driver than
	    the <devicename>ed</devicename> driver, you will need to
	    change the references to the <devicename>ed</devicename>
	    interface appropriately.  This sample file also sets up
	    tracing to <filename>/var/tmp/gated.output</filename> for
	    debugging <application>&gated;</application>'s activity; you can
	    certainly turn off the tracing options if
	    <application>&gated;</application> works correctly for you.  You will need to
	    change the <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable>'s into the
	    network address of your own SLIP subnet (be sure to change the
	    net mask in the <literal>proto direct</literal> clause as
	    well).</para>

	  <para>Once you have installed and configured
	    <application>&gated;</application> on your system, you will need to
	    tell the FreeBSD startup scripts to run
	    <application>&gated;</application> in place of
	    <application>routed</application>.  The easiest way to accomplish
	    this is to set the <varname>router</varname> and
	    <varname>router_flags</varname> variables in
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Please see the manual
	    page for <application>&gated;</application> for information on
	    command-line parameters.</para>

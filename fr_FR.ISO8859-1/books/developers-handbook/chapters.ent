     Creates entities for each chapter in the FreeBSD Developer's
     Handbook. Each entity is named chap.foo, where foo is the value
     of the id attribute on that chapter, and corresponds to the name of
     the directory in which that chapter's .sgml file is stored.
   
     Chapters should be listed in the order in which they are referenced.

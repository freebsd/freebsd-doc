# Web site build hooks for the release notes.  Also see the README file.
#
# The variable RELNOTES (I couldn't think of a better name) is a poor
# man's list.  Its semantics are very similar to that of MLINKS (see
# bsd.man.mk).  The first word is the directory under which that set
# of relnotes should appear on the web site.  The second word is the
# path to that relnotes set.

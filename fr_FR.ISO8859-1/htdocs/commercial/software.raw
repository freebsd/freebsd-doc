Dragon is a real-time, packet-based, intrusion-detection system.
Dragon sensors collect events,
based on user configurable data driven attack signatures
and protocol violations.
When events occur,
Dragon collects the response from the target server,
along with any other traffic that an attacker may try.
Event data is logged to a database
that can be analyzed with a variety of command line forensic tools
that summarize events, replay suspicious network sessions,
and perform statistical analysis.
Dragon sensors can send real-time data via SNMP traps, Syslog messages,
and a Blowfish-encrypted, ICMP-based network pipe
to a central Dragon-Master server.
Up to one hundred sensors can be handled by one Dragon-Master server.
Dragon correctly reconstructs IP fragments and UDP/TCP network traffic.
It can also operate at 100base-T speeds
and some customers have placed Dragon onto Gigabit networks with success.

<title>FreeBSD Device Driver Writer's Guide
<author>Eric L. Hernes, <tt/erich@rrnet.com/
<date>Wednesday, May 29, 1996

<abstract>

This document describes how to add a device driver to FreeBSD.  It is
<it/not/ intended to be a tutorial on UNIX device drivers in general.
It is intended for device driver authors, familiar with the UNIX
device driver model, to work on FreeBSD.

</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>2.x specific

<p>Due to changes in FreeBSD over time, this guide is only accurate as
regards FreeBSD 2.x.  A replacement guide for FreeBSD 3.x and beyond
is being written.  Please contact Jeroen Ruigrok <tt/&lt;asmodai@wxs.nl&gt;/
if you would like to help with this.

<sect> Overview

<p> <it> 
The FreeBSD kernel is very well documented, unfortunately it's all
in `C'.
</it>

<sect> Types of drivers.

<sect1> Character

<sect2> Data Structures
<p> <tt/struct cdevsw/ Structure

<sect2> Entry Points
<sect3> d_open()
<p>
d_open() takes several arguments, the formal list looks something like:
<code>
int
d_open(dev_t dev, int flag, int mode, struct proc *p)
</code>
d_open() is called on <em/every/ open of the device.
<p>

The <tt/dev/ argument contains the major and minor number of the
device opened.  These are available through the macros <tt/major()/ and
<tt/minor()/
<p>

The <tt/flag/ and <tt/mode/ arguments are as described in the 
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?open(2)" name="open(2)">
manual page.  It is recommended that you check these for access modes
in &lt;sys/fcntl.h&gt; and do what is required.  For example if <tt/flag/
is (O_NONBLOCK | O_EXLOCK) the open should fail if either it would
block, or exclusive access cannot be granted.
<p>

The <tt/p/ argument contains all the information about the current
process.

<sect3> d_close()
<p>
d_close() takes the same argument list as d_open():
<code>
int
d_close(dev_t dev , int flag , int mode , struct proc *p)
</code>

d_close() is only called on the last close of your device (per minor
device). For example in the following code fragment, d_open() is called
3 times, but d_close() is called only once.
<code>
 ...
    fd1=open("/dev/mydev", O_RDONLY);
    fd2=open("/dev/mydev", O_RDONLY);
    fd3=open("/dev/mydev", O_RDONLY);
 ...
   <useful stuff with fd1, fd2, fd3 here>
 ...
    close(fd1);
    close(fd2);
    close(fd3);
 ...
</code>

The arguments are similar to those described above for 
d_open().

<sect3> d_read() and d_write()
<p>
d_read() and d_write take the following argument lists:
<code>
int
d_read(dev_t dev, struct uio *uio, int flat)
int
d_write(dev_t dev, struct uio *uio, int flat)
</code>

The d_read() and d_write() entry points are called when
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?read(2)" name="read(2)"> and
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?write(2)" name="write(2)">
are called on your device from user-space.  The transfer
of data can be handled through the kernel support routine uiomove().

<sect3> d_ioctl()
<p>
It's argument list is as follows:
<code>
int
d_ioctl(dev_t dev, int cmd, caddr_t arg, int flag, struct proc *p)
</code>

d_ioctl() is a catch-all for operations which don't make sense in
a read/write paradigm.  Probably the most famous of all ioctl's is on
tty devices, through
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?stty(1)" name="stty(1)">.
The ioctl entry point is called from
ioctl() in sys/kern/sys_generic.c<p>

There are four different types of ioctl's which can be implemented.
&lt;sys/ioccom.h&gt; contains convenience macros for defining these ioctls.

<tt/_IO(g,n)/ for control type operations. &nl;

<tt/_IOR(g,n,t)/ for operations that read data from a device. &nl;

<tt/_IOW(g,n,t)/ for operations that write data to a device. &nl;

<tt/_IOWR(g,n,t)/ for operations that write to a device, and then 
read data back. &nl;

Here <tt/g/ refers to a <em/group/. This is an 8-bit value, typically
indicative of the device; for example, 't' is used in tty ioctls.
<tt/n/ refers to the number of the ioctl within the group.  On SCO, this
number alone denotes the ioctl.  <tt/t/ is the data type which will
get passed to the driver; this gets handed to a sizeof() operator in
the kernel.  The ioctl() system call will either copyin() or copyout()
or both for your driver, then hand you a pointer to the data structure
in the <tt/arg/ argument of the d_ioctl call.  Currently the data size
is limited to one page (4k on the i386).

<sect3> d_stop()
<sect3> d_reset()
<sect3> d_devtotty()
<sect3> d_poll() (3.0+) or d_select() (2.2)
<p>
d_poll()'s argument list is as follows:
<code>
void
d_poll(dev_t dev, int events, struct proc *p)
</code>

<p> d_poll() is used to find out if a device is ready for IO.  An
example is waiting for data to become available from the network, or
waiting for the user to press a key.  This correspond to the poll()
call in userland.

<p>The d_poll() call should check for the events specified in the
event mask.  If none of the requested events are active, but they may
become active later, it should record this for the kernel's later
persual.  d_poll() does this by calling selrecord() with a selinfo
structure for this device.  The sum of all these activities look
something like this:

<code>
static struct my_softc {
	struct queue rx_queue;  /* As example only - not required */
	struct queue tx_queue;  /* As example only - not required */
	struct selinfo selp;    /* Required */
} my_softc[NMYDEV];

...

static int
mydevpoll(dev_t dev, int events, struct proc *p)
{
	int revents = 0;	/* Events we found */
	int s;
	struct my_softc *sc = &amp;my_softc[dev];

	/* We can only check for IN and OUT */
	if ((events &amp; (POLLIN|POLLOUT)) == 0)
		return(POLLNVAL);
	
	s = splhigh();
	/* Writes are if the transmit queue can take them */
	if ((events &amp; POLLOUT) &amp;&amp;
	    !IF_QFULL(sc->tx_queue))
		revents |= POLLOUT;
	/* ... while reads are OK if we have any data */
	if ((events &amp; POLLIN) &amp;&amp;
	    !IF_QEMPTY(sc->rx_queue))
		revents |= POLLIN;
	if (revents == 0)
		selrecord(p, &amp;sc->selp);
	splx(s);
	return revents;
}
</code>

<p>
d_select() is used in 2.2 and previous versions of FreeBSD.  Instead
of 'events' it take a single int 'rw', which can be FREAD for reads
(as in POLLIN above), FWRITE for write (as in POLLOUT above), and 0
for 'exception' - something exceptional happened, like a card being
inserted or removed for the pccard driver.

<p>For select, the above code fragment would look like this:
<code>
static int
mydevselect(dev_t dev, int rw, struct proc *p)
{
	int ret = 0;
	int s;
	struct my_softc *sc = &amp;my_softc[dev];

	s = splhigh();
	switch (rw) {
	case FWRITE:
		/* Writes are if the transmit queue can take them */
		if (!IF_QFULL(sc->tx_queue))
			ret = 1;
		break;
	case FREAD:
		/* ... while reads are OK if we have any data */
		if (!IF_QEMPTY(sc->rx_queue))
			ret = 1;
		break;
	case 0:
		/* This driver never get any exceptions */
		break;
        }
	if(ret == 0)
		selrecord(p, &amp;sc->selp);
	splx(s);
	return(revents);
}
</code>

<sect3> d_mmap()
<sect3> d_strategy()
<p>
d_strategy()'s argument list is as follows:
<code>
void
d_strategy(struct buf *bp)
</code>

<p> d_strategy() is used for devices which use some form of scatter-gather
io.  It is most common in a block device.  This is significantly different
than the System V model, where only the block driver performs scatter-gather
io. Under BSD, character devices are sometimes requested to perform
scatter-gather io via the readv() and writev() system calls.

<sect> Supported Busses

<sect1> ISA -- Industry Standard Architecture
<sect2> Data Structures

<sect3> <tt/struct isa_device/ Structure
<p>
This structure is required, but generally it is created by
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)">
from the kernel configuration file.  It is required on a per-device
basis, meaning that if you have a driver which controls two serial
boards, you will have two isa_device structures.  If you build a
device as an LKM, you must create your own isa_device structure to
reflect your configuration. (lines 85 - 131 in pcaudio_lkm.c) There is
nearly a direct mapping between the config file and the isa_device
structure. The definition from /usr/src/sys/i386/isa/isa_device.h is:
<code>
struct isa_device {
        int     id_id;          /* device id */
        struct  isa_driver *id_driver;
        int     id_iobase;      /* base i/o address */
        u_short id_irq;         /* interrupt request */
        short   id_drq;         /* DMA request */
        caddr_t id_maddr;       /* physical i/o memory address on bus (if any)*/
        int     id_msize;       /* size of i/o memory */
        inthand2_t *id_intr;    /* interrupt interface routine */
        int     id_unit;        /* unit number */
        int     id_flags;       /* flags */
        int     id_scsiid;      /* scsi id if needed */
        int     id_alive;       /* device is present */
#define RI_FAST         1               /* fast interrupt handler */
        u_int   id_ri_flags;    /* flags for register_intr() */
        int     id_reconfig;    /* hot eject device support (such as PCMCIA) */
        int     id_enabled;     /* is device enabled */
        int     id_conflicts;   /* we're allowed to conflict with things */
        struct isa_device *id_next; /* used in isa_devlist in userconfig() */
};
</code>

<!-- XXX add stuff here -->
<sect3> <tt/struct isa_driver/ Structure

<p>
This structure is defined in ``/usr/src/sys/i386/isa/isa_device.h''.
These are required on a per-driver basis.  The definition is:
<code>
struct isa_driver {
        int     (*probe) __P((struct isa_device *idp));
                                        /* test whether device is present */
        int     (*attach) __P((struct isa_device *idp));
                                        /* setup driver for a device */
        char    *name;                  /* device name */
        int     sensitive_hw;           /* true if other probes confuse us */
};
</code>

This is the structure used by the probe/attach code to detect and
initialize your device.  The <tt/probe/ member is a pointer to your
device probe function; the <tt/attach/ member is a pointer to your
attach function.  The <tt/name/ member is a character pointer to the
two or three letter name for your driver.  This is the name reported
during the probe/attach process (and probably also in 
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?lsdev(8)" name="lsdev(8)">). The
<tt/sensitive_hw/ member is a flag which helps the probe code
determine probing order.

A typical instantiation is:
<code>
struct  isa_driver      mcddriver = { mcd_probe, mcd_attach, "mcd" };
</code>

<sect2> Entry Points

<sect3> probe()
<p>
probe() takes a <tt/struct isa_device/ pointer as an argument and returns
an int.  The return value is ``zero'' or ``non-zero'' as to the absence
or presence of your device.  This entry point may (and probably should)
be declared as <tt/static/ because it is accessed via the <tt/probe/ member
of the <tt/struct isa_driver/ structure.  This function is intended
to detect the presence of your device only; it should not do any
configuration of the device itself.

<sect3> attach()
<p>
attach() also takes a <tt/struct isa_device/ pointer as an argument and
returns an int.  The return value is also ``zero'' or ``non-zero'' indicating
whether or not the attach was successful.  This function is intended
to do any special initialization of the device as well as confirm that
the device is usable.  It too should be declared <tt/static/ because 
it is accessed through the <tt/attach/ member of the <tt/isa_driver/ 
structure.

<sect> Linking Into the Kernel.

<p>
In FreeBSD, support for the ISA and EISA busses is i386 specific.
While FreeBSD itself is presently available on the i386 platform,
some effort has been made to make the PCI, PCCARD, and SCSI code
portable.  The ISA and EISA specific code resides in
/usr/src/sys/i386/isa and /usr/src/sys/i386/eisa respectively.
The machine independent PCI, PCCARD, and SCSI code reside in
/usr/src/sys/{pci,pccard,scsi}. The i386 specific code for these
reside in /usr/src/sys/i386/{pci,pccard,scsi}.

<p>
In FreeBSD, a device driver can be either binary or source.  There is
no ``official'' place for binary drivers to reside.  BSD/OS uses
something like sys/i386/OBJ.  Since most drivers are distributed
in source, the following discussion refers to a source driver.
Binary only drivers are sometimes provided by hardware vendors
who wish to maintain the source as proprietary.

<p>
A typical driver has the source code in one c-file, say dev.c.  The
driver also can have some include files; devreg.h typically contains
public device register declarations, macros, and other driver
specific declarations.  Some drivers call this devvar.h instead.
Some drivers, such as the dgb (for the Digiboard PC/Xe),
require microcode to be loaded onto the board.  For the dgb driver
the microcode is compiled and dumped into a header file ala
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?file2c(1)" name="file2c(1)">.

<p>
If the driver has data structures and ioctl's which are specific to
the driver/device, and need to be accessible from user-space, they
should be put in a separate include file which will reside in
/usr/include/machine/ (some of these reside in /usr/include/sys/).
These are typically named something like ioctl_dev.h or devio.h.

<p>
If a driver is being written which, from user space is
identical to a device which already exists, care should be taken to
use the same ioctl interface and data structures.  For example, from
user space, a SCSI CDROM drive should be identical to an IDE cdrom
drive; or a serial line on an intelligent multiport card (Digiboard,
Cyclades, ...)  should be identical to the sio devices.  These devices
have a fairly well defined interface which should be used.

<p>
There are two methods for linking a driver into the kernel, static and 
the LKM model.  The first method is fairly standard across the
*BSD family.  The other method was originally developed by Sun
(I believe), and has been implemented into BSD using the Sun model.
I don't believe that the current implementation uses any Sun code.

<sect1> Standard Model

<p>
The steps required to add your driver to the standard FreeBSD kernel are
<itemize>
<item> Add to the driver list
<item> Add an entry to the &lsqb;bc&rsqb;devsw
<item> Add the driver entry to the kernel config file
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)">, 
compile, and install the kernel
<item> make required nodes.
<item> reboot.
</itemize>

<sect2> Adding to the driver list.
<p>
The standard model for adding a device driver to the Berkeley kernel
is to add your driver to the list of known devices. This list is 
dependent on the CPU architecture.  If the device is not i386 specific
(PCCARD, PCI, SCSI), the file is in ``/usr/src/sys/conf/files''.
If the device is i386 specific, use ``/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/files.i386''.
A typical line looks like:
<tscreen><code>
i386/isa/joy.c                  optional        joy     device-driver
</code></tscreen>

The first field is the pathname of the driver module relative to
/usr/src/sys. For the case of a binary driver the path would be
something like ``i386/OBJ/joy.o''.

The second field tells 
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)">
that this is an optional driver. Some
devices are required for the kernel to even be built.

The third field is the name of the device.

The fourth field tells config that it's a device driver (as opposed to
just optional).  This causes config to create entries for the device
in some structures in /usr/src/sys/compile/KERNEL/ioconf.c.

It is also possible to create a file
``/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/files.KERNEL'' whose contents will override
the default files.i386, but only for the kernel ``KERNEL''.

<sect2>Make room in conf.c
<p>
Now you must edit ``/usr/src/sys/i386/i386/conf.c'' to make an entry
for your driver.  Somewhere near the top, you need to declare your
entry points. The entry for the joystick driver is:
<code>
#include "joy.h"
#if NJOY > 0
d_open_t        joyopen;
d_close_t       joyclose;
d_rdwr_t        joyread;
d_ioctl_t       joyioctl;
#else
#define joyopen         nxopen
#define joyclose        nxclose
#define joyread         nxread
#define joyioctl        nxioctl
#endif
</code>

This either defines your entry points, or null entry points which
will return ENXIO when called (the #else clause).

The include file ``joy.h'' is automatically generated by
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)"> when
the kernel build tree is created.  This usually has only one line like:
<code>
#define NJOY 1
</code>
or
<code>
#define NJOY 0
</code>
which defines the number of your devices in your kernel.

You must additionally add a slot to either cdevsw&lsqb;&rsqb, or to
bdevsw&lsqb;&rsqb, depending on whether it is a character device or
a block device, or both if it is a block device with a raw interface.
The entry for the joystick driver is:

<code>
/* open, close, read, write, ioctl, stop, reset, ttys, select, mmap, strat */
struct cdevsw   cdevsw[] =
{
 ...
        { joyopen,      joyclose,       joyread,        nowrite,        /*51*/
          joyioctl,     nostop,         nullreset,      nodevtotty,/*joystick */
          seltrue,      nommap,         NULL},
 ...
}
</code>

Order is what determines the major number of your device. Which is why
there will always be an entry for your driver, either null entry
points, or actual entry points.  It is probably worth noting that this
is significantly different from SCO and other system V derivatives,
where any device can (in theory) have any major number.  This is
largely a convenience on FreeBSD, due to the way device nodes are
created.  More on this later.

<sect2>Adding your device to the config file.
<p>
This is simply adding a line describing your device.
The joystick description line is:
<verb>
device          joy0    at isa? port "IO_GAME"
</verb>
This says we have a device called ``joy0'' on the isa bus using
io-port ``IO_GAME'' (IO_GAME is a macro defined in
/usr/src/sys/i386/isa/isa.h).

A slightly more complicated entry is for the ``ix'' driver:
<verb>
device ix0 at isa? port 0x300 net irq 10 iomem 0xd0000 iosiz 32768 vector ixintr
</verb>
This says that we have a device called `ix0' on the ISA bus.  It uses
io-port 0x300. It's interrupt will be masked with other devices in
the network class. It uses interrupt 10. It uses
32k of shared memory at physical address 0xd0000.  It also defines
it's interrupt handler to be ``ixintr()''

<sect2><htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)">
the kernel.
<p>
Now with our config file in hand, we can create a kernel compile directory.
This is done by simply typing:
<verb>
# config KERNEL
</verb>
where KERNEL is the name of your config file.  Config creates a
compile tree for you kernel in /usr/src/sys/compile/KERNEL.  It
creates the Makefile, some .c files, and some .h files with macros
defining the number of each device in your kernel.

Now you can go to the compile directory and build.  Each time you run
config, your previous build tree will be removed, unless you config
with a -n.  If you have config'ed and compiled a GENERIC kernel, you can
``make links'' to avoid compiling a few files on each iteration.  I typically
run
<verb>
# make depend links all
</verb>
followed by a ``make install'' when the kernel is done to my liking.

<sect2>Making device nodes.
<p>
On FreeBSD, you are responsible for making your own device nodes.  The
major number of your device is determined by the slot number in the
device switch.  Minor number is driver dependent, of course.  You can
either run the mknod's from the command line, or add a section to
/dev/MAKEDEV.local, or even /dev/MAKEDEV to do the work.  I sometimes
create a MAKEDEV.dev script that can be run stand-alone or pasted
into /dev/MAKEDEV.local

<sect2>Reboot.
<p>
This is the easy part.  There are a number of ways to do this, reboot,
fastboot, shutdown -r, cycle the power, etc. Upon bootup you should
see your XXprobe() called, and if all is successful, your XXattach()
too.

<sect1> Loadable Kernel Module (LKM)

<p>
There are really no defined procedures for writing an LKM driver.  The
following is my own conception after experimenting with the LKM device
interface and looking at the standard device driver model, this is one
way of adding an LKM interface to an existing driver without touching
the original driver source (or binary).  It is recommended though,
that if you plan to release source to your driver, the LKM specific
parts should be part of the driver itself, conditionally compiled
on the LKM macro (i.e. #ifdef LKM).

This section will focus on writing the LKM specific part of the driver.  We
will assume that we have written a driver which will drop into the standard
device driver model, which we would now like to implement as an LKM.  We will
use the pcaudio driver as a sample driver, and develop an LKM front-end.  The
source and makefile for the pcaudio LKM, ``pcaudio_lkm.c'' and ``Makefile'',
should be placed in /usr/src/lkm/pcaudio.  What follows is a breakdown of
pcaudio_lkm.c.

Lines  17 -  26  

  --  This includes the file ``pca.h'' and conditionally compiles the rest
of the LKM on whether or not we have a pcaudio device defined.  This
mimics the behavior of config.  In a standard device driver,
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?config(8)" name="config(8)">
generates the pca.h file from the number pca devices in the config file.

device major number higher than what exists in conf.c, for example at
present, conf.c rev 1.85, there are 67 slots for character devices,
you cannot use a (character) major device number 67 or greater,

<sect2> <tt/struct uio/ Structure
<p>
This structure is used for moving data between the kernel and user spaces
through read() and write() system calls.  It is defined in
/usr/src/sys/sys/uio.h:
<code>
struct uio {
        struct  iovec *uio_iov;
        int     uio_iovcnt;
        off_t   uio_offset;
        int     uio_resid;
        enum    uio_seg uio_segflg;
        enum    uio_rw uio_rw;
        struct  proc *uio_procp;
};

  <title>Resources on the Internet</title>
  
  <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;.</emphasis></para>
  
  <para>The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a
    means of following the latest developments.  Electronic resources are the
    best, if not often the only, way stay informed of the latest advances.
    Since FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also
    generally serves as a &ldquo;technical support department&rdquo; of sorts,
    with electronic mail and  USENET news being the most effective way of
    reaching that community.</para>
      
  <para>The most important points of contact with the FreeBSD user community
    are outlined below.  If you are aware of other resources not mentioned
    here, please send them to the &a.doc;so that they may also be
    included.</para>
  
  <sect1 id="eresources-mail">
    <title>Mailing lists</title>
    
    <para>Though many of the FreeBSD development members read USENET, we
      cannot always guarantee that we will get to your questions in a timely
      fashion (or at all) if you post them only to one of the
      <literal>comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.*</literal> groups.  By addressing your
      questions to the appropriate mailing list you will reach both us and a
      concentrated FreeBSD audience, invariably assuring a better (or at least
      faster) response.</para>
	
    <para>The charters for the various lists are given at the bottom of this
      document.  <emphasis>Please read the charter before joining or sending
	mail to any list</emphasis>.  Most of our list subscribers now receive
      many hundreds of FreeBSD related messages every day, and by setting down
      charters and rules for proper use we are striving to keep the
      signal-to-noise ratio of the lists high. To do less would see the
      mailing lists ultimately fail as an effective communications medium for
      the project.</para>
	
    <para>Archives are kept for all of the mailing lists and can be searched
      using the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search.html">FreeBSD World
	Wide Web server</ulink>.  The keyword searchable archive offers an
      excellent way of finding answers to frequently asked questions and
      should be consulted before posting a question.</para>

      <para>All mailing lists live on <hostid
	  role="fqdn">FreeBSD.org</hostid>, so to post to a given list you
	simply mail to
	&lt;<replaceable>listname</replaceable>@FreeBSD.org&gt;.  It will then
	be redistributed to mailing list members world-wide.</para>
	  
      <para>To subscribe to a list, send mail to &a.majordomo; and include
	
	<programlisting>
subscribe &lt;listname&gt; [&lt;optional address&gt;]</programlisting>

	in the body of your message.  For example, to subscribe yourself to
	<literal>freebsd-announce</literal>, you'd do:</para>
	    
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mail majordomo@FreeBSD.org</userinput>
subscribe freebsd-announce
^D</screen>
	    
      <para>If you want to subscribe yourself under a different name, or
	submit a subscription request for a local mailing list (this is more
	efficient if you have several interested parties at one site, and
	highly appreciated by us!), you would do something like:</para>
	    	    
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mail majordomo@FreeBSD.org</userinput>
subscribe freebsd-announce local-announce@somesite.com
^D</screen>
	    
      <para>Finally, it is also possible to unsubscribe yourself from a list,
	get a list of other list members or see the list of mailing lists
	again by sending other types of control messages to majordomo.  For a
	complete list of available commands, do this:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mail majordomo@FreeBSD.org</userinput>
help
^D</screen>
	    
      <para>Again, we would like to request that you keep discussion in the
	technical mailing lists on a technical track. If you are only
	interested in the &ldquo;high points&rdquo; then it is suggested that
	you join freebsd-announce, which is intended only for infrequent
	traffic.</para>

      <para><emphasis>All</emphasis>FreeBSD mailing lists have certain basic
	rules which must be adhered to by anyone using them. Failure to comply
	with these guidelines will result in two (2) written warnings from the
	FreeBSD Postmaster <email>postmaster@FreeBSD.org</email>, after which,
	on a third offense, the poster will removed from all FreeBSD mailing
	lists and filtered from further posting to them. We regret that such
	rules and measures are necessary at all, but today's Internet is a
	pretty harsh environment, it would seem, and many fail to appreciate
	just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.</para>
	  
      <para>Rules of the road:</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The topic of any posting should adhere to the basic charter of
	    the list it is posted to, e.g. if the list is about technical
	    issues then your posting should contain technical discussion.
	    Ongoing irrelevant chatter or flaming only detracts from the value
	    of the mailing list for everyone on it and will not be tolerated.
	    For free-form discussion on no particular topic, the freebsd-chat
	    <email>freebsd-chat@FreeBSD.org</email> mailing list is freely
	    available and should be used instead.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>No posting should be made to more than 2 mailing lists, and
	    only to 2 when a clear and obvious need to post to both lists
	    exists.  For most lists, there is already a great deal of
	    subscriber overlap and except for the most esoteric mixes (say
	    "-stable &amp; -scsi"), there really is no reason to post to more
	    than one list at a time.  If a message is sent to you in such a
	    way that multiple mailing lists appear on the Cc line then the cc
	    line should also be trimmed before sending it out again.

	  <para>Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument)

	    Gross breaches of netiquette, like excerpting or reposting private
	    mail when permission to do so was not and would not be
	    forthcoming, are frowned upon but not specifically enforced.
	    <emphasis>However</emphasis>, there are also very few cases where

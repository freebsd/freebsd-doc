    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>UNIX has always had support for serial communications.  In fact,
      the very first UNIX machines relied on serial lines for user input
      and output.  Things have changed a lot from the days when the average
      &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; consisted of a 10-character-per-second serial
      printer and a keyboard.  This chapter will cover some of the ways in
      which FreeBSD uses serial communications.</para>

    <title>Serial Basics</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Assembled from FAQ.</emphasis></para>
    
    <para>This section should give you some general information about serial
      ports.  If you do not find what you want here, check into the Terminal
      and Dialup sections of the handbook.</para>

    <para>The <filename>ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></filename> (or
      <filename>cuaa<replaceable>X</replaceable></filename>) device is the
      regular device you will want to open for your applications.  When a
      process opens the device, it will have a default set of terminal I/O
      settings.  You can see these settings with the command</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1</userinput></screen>
	  
    <para>When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in
      effect until the device is closed.  When it is reopened, it goes back to
      the default set.  To make changes to the default set, you can open and
      adjust the settings of the &ldquo;initial state&rdquo; device. For
      example, to turn on <acronym>CLOCAL</acronym> mode, 8 bits, and
      <emphasis>XON/XOFF</emphasis> flow control by default for ttyd5,
      do:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff</userinput></screen>
	  
    <para>A good place to do this is in <filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename>.
      Now, an application will have these settings by default when it opens
      <filename>ttyd5</filename>. It can still change these settings to its
      liking, though.</para>

    <para>You can also prevent certain settings from being changed by an
      application by making adjustments to the &ldquo;lock state&rdquo;
      device.  For example, to lock the speed of <filename>ttyd5</filename> to
      57600 bps, do</para>
	  
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now, an application that opens <filename>ttyd5</filename> and tries
      to change the speed of the port will be stuck with 57600 bps.</para>

    <para>Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state devices
      writable only by <username>root</username>.  The
      <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> script does <emphasis>not</emphasis> do
      this when it creates the device entries.</para>

    <title>Terminals</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.kelly;  28 July 1996</emphasis></para>

    <para>Terminals provide a convenient and low-cost way to access the power
      of your FreeBSD system when you are not at the computer's console or on
      a connected network.  This section describes how to use terminals with
      FreeBSD.</para>

    <sect2 id="term-uses">
      <title>Uses and Types of Terminals</title>
      
      <para>The original Unix systems did not have consoles.  Instead, people
	logged in and ran programs through terminals that were connected to
	the computer's serial ports.  It is quite similar to using a modem and
	some terminal software to dial into a remote system to do text-only
	work.</para>
	  
      <para>Today's PCs have consoles capable of high quality graphics, but
	the ability to establish a login session on a serial port still exists
	in nearly every Unix-style operating system today; FreeBSD is no
	exception.  By using a terminal attached to a unused serial port, you
	can log in and run any text program that you would normally run on the
	console or in an <command>xterm</command> window in the X Window
	System.</para>
	  
      <para>For the business user, you can attach many terminals to a FreeBSD
	system and place them on your employees' desktops.  For a home user, a
	spare computer such as an older IBM PC or a Macintosh can be a
	terminal wired into a more powerful computer running FreeBSD.  You can
	turn what might otherwise be a single-user computer into a powerful
	multiple user system.</para>
	  
      <para>For FreeBSD, there are three kinds of terminals:</para>

      <para>The remaining subsections describe each kind.</para>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-dumb">
	<title>Dumb Terminals</title>

	<para>Dumb terminals are specialized pieces of hardware that let you
	  connect to computers over serial lines.  They are called
	  &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; because they have only enough computational power
	  to display, send, and receive text.  You cannot run any programs on
	  them.  It is the computer to which you connect them that has all the
	  power to run text editors, compilers, email, games, and so
	  forth.</para>
	    
	<para>There are hundreds of kinds of dumb terminals made by many
	  manufacturers, including Digital Equipment Corporation's VT-100 and
	  Wyse's WY-75.  Just about any kind will work with FreeBSD. Some
	  high-end terminals can even display graphics, but only certain
	  software packages can take advantage of these advanced
	  features.</para>
	    
	<para>Dumb terminals are popular in work environments where workers do
	  not need access to graphic applications such as those provided by
	  the X Window System.</para>
      </sect3>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-pcs">
	<title>PCs Acting As Terminals</title>

	<para>If a <link linkend="term-dumb">dumb terminal</link> has just
	  enough ability to display, send, and receive text, then certainly
	  any spare personal computer can be a dumb terminal. All you need is
	  the proper cable and some <emphasis>terminal emulation</emphasis>
	  software to run on the computer.</para>
	    
	<para>Such a configuration is popular in homes.  For example, if your
	  spouse is busy working on your FreeBSD system's console, you can do
	  some text-only work at the same time from a less powerful personal
	  computer hooked up as a terminal to the FreeBSD system.</para>
      </sect3>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-x">
	<title>X Terminals</title>

	<para>X terminals are the most sophisticated kind of terminal
	  available.  Instead of connecting to a serial port, they usually
	  connect to a network like Ethernet.  Instead of being relegated to
	  text-only applications, they can display any X application.</para>
	    
	<para>We introduce X terminals just for the sake of completeness.
	  However, this chapter does <emphasis>not</emphasis> cover setup,
	  configuration, or use of X terminals.</para>

    <sect2 id="term-cables-ports">
      <title>Cables and Ports</title>
      
      <para>To connect a terminal to your FreeBSD system, you need the right
	kind of cable and a serial port to which to connect it.  This section
	tells you what to do.  If you are already familiar with your terminal
	and the cable it requires, skip to <link
	  linkend="term-config">Configuration</link>.</para>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-cables">
	<title>Cables</title>

	<para>Because terminals use serial ports, you need to use
	  serial&mdash;also known as RS-232C&mdash;cables to connect the
	  terminal to the FreeBSD system.</para>
	    
	<para>There are a couple of kinds of serial cables.  Which one
	  you'll use depends on the terminal you want to connect:</para>
	    
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you are connecting a personal computer to act as a
	      terminal, use a <link linkend="term-null">null-modem</link>
	      cable.  A null-modem cable connects two computers or terminals
	      together.</para>
	  </listitem>
		
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you have an actual terminal, your best source of
	      information on what cable to use is the documentation that
	      accompanied the terminal.  If you do not have the documentation,
	      then try a <link linkend="term-null">null-modem</link> cable.
	      If that does not work, then try a <link
		linkend="term-std">standard</link> cable.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Also, the serial port on <emphasis>both</emphasis> the terminal
	  and your FreeBSD system must have connectors that will fit the cable
	  you are using.</para>
	    
	<sect4 id="term-null">
	  <title>Null-modem cables</title>
	  
	  <para>A null-modem cable passes some signals straight through, like
	    &ldquo;signal ground,&rdquo; but switches other signals.  For
	    example, the &ldquo;send data&rdquo; pin on one end goes to the
	    &ldquo;receive data&rdquo; pin on the other end.</para>
	      
	  <para>If you like making your own cables, here is a table showing a
	    recommended way to construct a null-modem cable for use with
	    terminals.  This table shows the RS-232C signal names and the pin

	<title>Ports</title>

	<para>Serial ports are the devices through which data is transferred
	  between the FreeBSD host computer and the terminal. This section
	  describes the kinds of ports that exist and how they are addressed
	  in FreeBSD.</para>

	<sect4 id="term-portkinds">
	  <title>Kinds of Ports</title>
	  
	  <para>Several kinds of serial ports exist.  Before you purchase or
	    construct a cable, you need to make sure it will fit the ports on
	    your terminal and on the FreeBSD system.</para>
	      
	  <para>Most terminals will have DB25 ports.  Personal computers,
	    including PCs running FreeBSD, will have DB25 or DB9 ports. If you
	    have a multiport serial card for your PC, you may have RJ-12 or
	    RJ-45 ports.</para>
	      
	  <para>See the documentation that accompanied the hardware for
	    specifications on the kind of port in use.  A visual inspection of
	    the port often works, too.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="term-portnames">
	  <title>Port Names</title>
	  
	  <para>In FreeBSD, you access each serial port through an entry in
	    the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.  There are two different
	    kinds of entries:</para>
	      
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Callin ports are named
		<filename>/dev/ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></filename>
		where <replaceable>X</replaceable> is the port number,
		starting from zero.  Generally, you use the callin port for
		terminals.  Callin ports require that the serial line assert
		the data carrier detect (DCD) signal to work.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Callout ports are named
		<filename>/dev/cuaa<replaceable>X</replaceable></filename>.
		You usually do not use the callout port for terminals, just
		for modems.  You may use the callout port if the serial cable
		or the terminal does not support the carrier detect
		signal.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  <para>See the &man.sio.4; manual page for more information.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you have connected a terminal to the first serial port
	    (<devicename>COM1</devicename> in DOS parlance), then you want to
	    use <filename>/dev/ttyd0</filename> to refer to the terminal.  If
	    it is on the second serial port (also known as
	    <devicename>COM2</devicename>), it is
	    <filename>/dev/ttyd1</filename>, and so forth.</para>
	      
	  <para>Note that you may have to configure your kernel to support
	    each serial port, especially if you have a multiport serial card.
	    See <link linkend="kernelconfig">Configuring the FreeBSD
	      Kernel</link> for more information.</para>
	</sect4>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="term-config">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      
      <para>This section describes what you need to configure on your FreeBSD
	system to enable a login session on a terminal.  It assumes you have
	already configured your kernel to support the serial port to which the
	terminal is connected&mdash;and that you have connected it.</para>
	  
      <para>In a nutshell, you need to tell the <command>init</command>
	process, which is responsible for process control and initialization,
	to start a <command>getty</command> process, which is responsible for
	reading a login name and starting the <command>login</command>
	program.</para>
	  
      <para>To do so, you have to edit the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>
	file.  First, use the <command>su</command> command to become root.
	Then, make the following changes to
	<filename>/etc/ttys</filename>:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Add an line to <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> for the entry in
	    the <filename>/dev</filename> directory for the serial port if it
	    is not already there.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Specify that <filename>/usr/libexec/getty</filename> be run on
	    the port, and specify the appropriate
	    <replaceable>getty</replaceable> type from the
	    <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> file.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Specify the default terminal type.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Set the port to &ldquo;on.&rdquo;</para>
	</step>
	      
	<step>
	  <para>Specify whether the port should be
	    &ldquo;secure.&rdquo;</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Force <command>init</command> to reread the
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>
      
      <para>As an optional step, you may wish to create a custom
	<replaceable>getty</replaceable> type for use in step 2 by making an
	entry in <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>.  This document does
	not explain how to do so; you are encouraged to see the
	  &man.gettytab.5; and the &man.getty.8; manual pages for more
	information.</para>
      
      <para>The remaining sections detail how to do these steps.  We will use
	a running example throughout these sections to illustrate what we need
	to do.  In our example, we will connect two terminals to the system: a
	Wyse-50 and a old 286 IBM PC running Procomm terminal software
	emulating a VT-100 terminal.  We connect the Wyse to the second serial
	port and the 286 to the sixth serial port (a port on a multiport
	serial card).</para>
      
      <para>For more information on the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>
	file, see the &man.ttys.5; manual page.</para>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-etcttys">
	<title>Adding an Entry to <filename>/etc/ttys</filename></title>

	<para>First, you need to add an entry to the
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file, unless one is already
	  there.</para>

	<para>The <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file lists all of the ports
	  on your FreeBSD system where you want to allow logins.  For example,
	  the first virtual console <filename>ttyv0</filename> has an entry in
	  this file.  You can log in on the console using this entry.  This
	  file contains entries for the other virtual consoles, serial ports,
	  and pseudo-ttys.  For a hardwired terminal, just list the serial
	  port's <filename>/dev</filename> entry without the
	  <filename>/dev</filename> part.</para>
	    
	<para>When you installed your FreeBSD system, the
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file included entries for the first
	  four serial ports: <filename>ttyd0</filename> through
	  <filename>ttyd3</filename>.  If you are attaching a terminal on one
	  of those ports, you do not need to add an entry.</para>
	    
	<para>In our example, we attached a Wyse-50 to the second serial port,
	  <filename>ttyd1</filename>, which is already in the file.  We need
	  to add an entry for the 286 PC connected to the sixth serial port.
	  Here is an excerpt of the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file after
	  we add the new entry:</para>

	<programlisting>
ttyd1   "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   unknown off secure
ttyd5</programlisting>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="term-getty">
	<title>Specifying the <replaceable>getty</replaceable> Type</title>

	<para>Next, we need to specify what program will be run to handle the
	  logins on a terminal.  For FreeBSD, the standard program to do that
	  is <filename>/usr/libexec/getty</filename>.  It is what provides the
	  <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt.</para>
	    
	<para>The program <command>getty</command> takes one (optional)
	  parameter on its command line, the <replaceable>getty</replaceable>
	  type. A <replaceable>getty</replaceable> type tells about
	  characteristics on the terminal line, like bps rate and parity. The
	  <command>getty</command> program reads these characteristics from
	  the file <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>.</para>
	    
	<para>The file <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> contains lots of
	  entries for terminal lines both old and new.  In almost all cases,
	  the entries that start with the text <literal>std</literal> will
	  work for hardwired terminals. These entries ignore parity.  There is
	  a <literal>std</literal> entry for each bps rate from 110 to 115200.
	  Of course, you can add your own entries to this file. The manual
	  page &man.gettytab.5; provides more
	  information.</para>
	    
	<para>When setting the <replaceable>getty</replaceable> type in the
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file, make sure that the
	  communications settings on the terminal match.</para>
	    
	<para>For our example, the Wyse-50 uses no parity and connects at
	  38400 bps.  The 286 PC uses no parity and connects at 19200 bps.
	  Here is the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file so far (showing just
	  the two terminals in which we are interested):</para>

	<programlisting>
ttyd1   "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400"   unknown off secure
ttyd5   "/usr/libexec/getty std.19200"</programlisting>

	<para>Note that the second field&mdash;where we specify what program
	  to run&mdash;appears in quotes.  This is important, otherwise the
	  type argument to <command>getty</command> might be interpreted as
	  the next field.</para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="term-deftermtype">
	<title>Specifying the Default Terminal Type</title>

	<para>The third field in the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file lists
	  the default terminal type for the port.  For dialup ports, you
	  typically put <literal>unknown</literal> or
	  <literal>dialup</literal> in this field because users may dial up
	  with practically any kind of terminal or software. For hardwired
	  terminals, the terminal type does not change, so you can put a real
	  terminal type in this field.</para>

	<para>Users will usually use the <command>tset</command> program in
	  their <filename>.login</filename> or <filename>.profile</filename>
	  files to check the terminal type and prompt for one if necessary.
	  By setting a terminal type in the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>
	  file, users can forego such prompting.</para>

	<para>To find out what terminal types FreeBSD supports, see the
	  file <filename>/usr/share/misc/termcap</filename>.  It lists
	  about 600 terminal types.  You can add more if you wish.  See
	  the &man.termcap.5; manual page for information.</para>

	<para>In our example, the Wyse-50 is a Wyse-50 type of terminal
	  (although it can emulate others, we will leave it in Wyse-50 mode).
	  The 286 PC is running Procomm which will be set to emulate a VT-100.
	  Here are the pertinent yet unfinished entries from the
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file:</para>

	<programlisting>

	<title>Enabling the Port</title>

	<para>The next field in <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>, the fourth
	  field, tells whether to enable the port.  Putting
	  <literal>on</literal> here will have the <command>init</command>
	  process start the program in the second field,
	  <command>getty</command>, which will prompt for a login.  If you put
	  <literal>off</literal> in the fourth field, there will be no

	<title>Specifying Secure Ports</title>

	<para>We have arrived at the last field (well, almost: there is an
	  optional <literal>window</literal> specifier, but we will ignore
	  that).  The last field tells whether the port is secure.</para>
	    
	<para>What does &ldquo;secure&rdquo; mean?</para>
	    
	<para>It means that the root account (or any account with a user ID of
	  0) may login on the port.  Insecure ports do not allow root to
	  login.</para>

	<para>How do you use secure and insecure ports?</para>

	<para>By marking a port as insecure, the terminal to which it is
	  connected will not allow root to login.  People who know the root
	  password to your FreeBSD system will first have to login using a
	  regular user account.  To gain superuser privileges, they will then
	  have to use the <command>su</command> command.</para>
	    
	<para>Because of this, you will have two records to help track down
	  possible compromises of root privileges: both the
	  <command>login</command> and the <command>su</command> command make
	  records in the system log (and logins are also recorded in the
	  <filename>wtmp</filename> file).</para>
	    
	<para>By marking a port as secure, the terminal will allow root in.
	  People who know the root password will just login as root. You will
	  not have the potentially useful login and <command>su</command>
	  command records.</para>
	    
	<para>Which should you use?</para>

	<para>Just use &ldquo;insecure.&rdquo;  Use &ldquo;insecure&rdquo;
	  <emphasis>even</emphasis> for terminals <emphasis>not</emphasis> in
	  public user areas or behind locked doors.  It is quite easy to login
	  and use <command>su</command> if you need superuser
	  privileges.</para>
	    
	<para>Here finally are the completed entries in the

    <para>This document provides suggestions for configuring a FreeBSD system
      to handle dialup modems.  This document is written based on the author's
      experience with FreeBSD versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1.5.1 (and experience
      with dialup modems on other UNIX-like operating systems); however, this

      specific enough to your environment. The author cannot be responsible if
      you damage your system or lose data due to attempting to follow the
      suggestions here.</para>

    <sect2 id="dialup-prereqs">
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      
      <para>To begin with, the author assumes you have some basic knowledge of
	FreeBSD.  You need to have FreeBSD installed, know how to edit files
	in a UNIX-like environment, and how to look up manual pages on the
	system.  As discussed below, you will need certain versions of
	FreeBSD, and knowledge of some terminology &amp; modem and
	cabling.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>FreeBSD Version</title>

	<para>First, it is assumed that you are using FreeBSD version 1.1 or
	  higher (including versions 2.x).  FreeBSD version 1.0 included two
	  different serial drivers, which complicates the situation.  Also,
	  the serial device driver (<devicename>sio</devicename>) has improved
	  in every release of FreeBSD, so more recent versions of FreeBSD are
	  assumed to have better and more efficient drivers than earlier
	  versions.</para>

	<para>When talking about communications data rates, the author does
	  not use the term &ldquo;baud&rdquo;.  Baud refers to the number of
	  electrical state transitions that may be made in a period of time,
	  while &ldquo;bps&rdquo; (bits per second) is the

	<title>External vs. Internal Modems</title>

	<para>External modems seem to be more convenient for dialup, because
	  external modems often can be semi-permanently configured via
	  parameters stored in non-volatile RAM and they usually provide
	  lighted indicators that display the state of important RS-232
	  signals.  Blinking lights impress visitors, but lights are also very
	  useful to see whether a modem is operating properly.</para>
	    
	<para>Internal modems usually lack non-volatile RAM, so their
	  configuration may be limited only to setting DIP switches.  If your
	  internal modem has any signal indicator lights, it is probably
	  difficult to view the lights when the system's cover is in
	  place.</para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Modems and Cables</title>
	    
	<para>A background knowledge of these items is assumed</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You know how to connect your modem to your computer so that
	      the two can communicate (unless you have an internal modem,
	      which does not need such a cable)</para>

	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>The first, connecting your modem, is usually simple &mdash; most
	  straight-through serial cables work without any problems.  You need
	  to have a cable with appropriate connectors (DB-25 or DB-9, male or
	  female) on each end, and the cable must be a DCE-to-DTE cable with
	  these signals wired:</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Signal Ground (<acronym>SG</acronym>)</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>FreeBSD needs the <acronym>RTS</acronym> and
	  <acronym>CTS</acronym> signals for flow-control at speeds above
	  2400bps, the <acronym>CD</acronym> signal to detect when a call has
	  been answered or the line has been hung up, and the
	  <acronym>DTR</acronym> signal to reset the modem after a session is
	  complete.  Some cables are wired without all of the needed signals,
	  so if you have problems, such as a login session not going away when
	  the line hangs up, you may have a problem with your cable.</para>
	    
	<para>The second prerequisite depends on the modem(s) you use.  If you
	  do not know your modem's command set by heart, you will need to have
	  the modem's reference book or user's guide handy. Sample commands
	  for USR Sportster 14,400 external modems will be given, which you
	  may be able to use as a reference for your own modem's
	  commands.</para>
	    
	<para>Lastly, you will need to know how to setup your modem so that it
	  will work well with FreeBSD.  Like other UNIX-like operating
	  systems, FreeBSD uses the hardware signals to find out when a call
	  has been answered or a line has been hung up and to hangup and reset
	  the modem after a call.  FreeBSD avoids sending commands to the
	  modem or watching for status reports from the modem.  If you are
	  familiar with connecting modems to PC-based bulletin board systems,
	  this may seem awkward.</para>

	<title>Serial Interface Considerations</title>

	<para>FreeBSD supports NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550-, and NS16550A-based
	  EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.24) communications interfaces.  The 8250 and
	  16450 devices have single-character buffers.  The 16550 device
	  provides a 16-character buffer, which allows for better system
	  performance.  (Bugs in plain 16550's prevent the use of the
	  16-character buffer, so use 16550A's if possible).  Because
	  single-character-buffer devices require more work by the operating
	  system than the 16-character-buffer devices, 16550A-based serial
	  interface cards are much preferred. If the system has many active
	  serial ports or will have a heavy load, 16550A-based cards are
	  better for low-error-rate communications.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Quick Overview</title>
      
      <para>Here is the process that FreeBSD follows to accept dialup logins.
	A <command>getty</command> process, spawned by
	<command>init</command>, patiently waits to open the assigned serial
	port (<filename>/dev/ttyd0</filename>, for our example).  The command
	<command>ps ax</command> might show this:</para>
	  
      <screen> 4850 ??  I      0:00.09 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0</screen>
	    
      <para>When a user dials the modem's line and the modems connect, the
	<acronym>CD</acronym> line is asserted by the modem.  The kernel
	notices that carrier has been detected and completes
	<command>getty</command>'s open of the port.  <command>getty</command>
	sends a <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt at the specified initial line
	speed.  <command>getty</command> watches to see if legitimate
	characters are received, and, in a typical configuration, if it finds
	junk (probably due to the modem's connection speed being different
	than <command>getty</command>'s speed), <command>getty</command> tries
	adjusting the line speeds until it receives reasonable
	characters.</para>
	  
      <para>We hope <command>getty</command> finds the correct speed and the
	user sees a <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt.  After the user enters
	his/her login name, <command>getty</command> executes
	<filename>/usr/bin/login</filename>, which completes the login by
	asking for the user's password and then starting the user's
	shell.</para>
	  
      <para>Let's dive into the configuration...</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>
      
      <para>FreeBSD kernels typically come prepared to search for four serial
	ports, known in the PC-DOS world as <devicename>COM1:</devicename>,
	<devicename>COM2:</devicename>, <devicename>COM3:</devicename>, and
	<devicename>COM4:</devicename>. FreeBSD can presently also handle
	&ldquo;dumb&rdquo; multiport serial interface cards, such as the Boca
	Board 1008 and 2016 (please see the manual page &man.sio.4; for kernel
	configuration information if you have a multiport serial card).  The
	default kernel only looks for the standard COM ports, though.</para>
	  
      <para>To see if your kernel recognizes any of your serial ports, watch
	for messages while the kernel is booting, or use the
	<command>/sbin/dmesg</command> command to replay the kernel's boot
	messages.  In particular, look for messages that start with the
	characters <literal>sio</literal>.  Hint: to view just the messages
	that have the word <literal>sio</literal>, use the command:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/sbin/dmesg | grep 'sio'</userinput></screen>
	    
      <para>For example, on a system with four serial ports, these are the
	serial-port specific kernel boot messages:</para>
      
      <screen>sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
sio0: type 16550A
sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
sio1: type 16550A
sio2 at 0x3e8-0x3ef irq 5 on isa
sio2: type 16550A
sio3 at 0x2e8-0x2ef irq 9 on isa
sio3: type 16550A</screen>
	  
      <para>If your kernel does not recognize all of your serial ports, you
	will probably need to configure a custom FreeBSD kernel for your
	system.</para>
      
      <para>Please see the BSD System Manager's Manual chapter on
	&ldquo;Building Berkeley Kernels with Config&rdquo; [the source for
	which is in <filename>/usr/src/share/doc/smm</filename>] and
	&ldquo;FreeBSD Configuration Options&rdquo; [in
	<filename>/sys/conf/options</filename> and in
	<filename>/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/options.<replaceable>arch</replaceable></filename>,
	with <emphasis>arch</emphasis> for example being
	<filename>i386</filename>] for more information on configuring and
	building kernels.  You may have to unpack the kernel source
	distribution if have not installed the system sources already
	(<filename>srcdist/srcsys.??</filename> in FreeBSD 1.1,
	<filename>srcdist/sys.??</filename> in FreeBSD 1.1.5.1, or the entire
	source distribution in FreeBSD 2.0) to be able to configure and build
	kernels.</para>
	  
      <para>Create a kernel configuration file for your system (if you have
	not already) by <command>cd</command>ing to
	<filename>/sys/i386/conf</filename>.  Then, if you are creating a new
	custom configuration file, copy the file
	<filename>GENERICAH</filename> (or <filename>GENERICBT</filename>, if
	you have a BusTek SCSI controller on FreeBSD 1.x) to
	<filename>YOURSYS</filename>, where <filename>YOURSYS</filename> is
	the name of your system, but in upper-case letters.  Edit the file,
	and change the device lines:</para>
	  
      <programlisting>
device		sio0	at isa? port "IO_COM1" tty irq 4 vector siointr
device		sio1	at isa? port "IO_COM2" tty irq 3 vector siointr
device		sio2	at isa? port "IO_COM3" tty irq 5 vector siointr
device		sio3    at isa? port "IO_COM4" tty irq 9 vector siointr</programlisting>
	  
      <para>You can comment-out or completely remove lines for devices you do
	not have.  If you have a multiport serial board, such as the Boca
	Board BB2016, please see the &man.sio.4; man page for complete
	information on how to write configuration lines for multiport boards.
	Be careful if you are using a configuration file that was previously
	used for a different version of FreeBSD because the device flags have
	changed between versions.</para>

      <note>
	<para><literal>port "IO_COM1"</literal> is a substitution for
	  <literal>port 0x3f8</literal>, <literal>IO_COM2</literal> is
	  <literal>0x2f8</literal>, <literal>IO_COM3</literal> is
	  <literal>0x3e8</literal>, and <literal>IO_COM4</literal> is
	  <literal>0x2e8</literal>, which are fairly common port addresses for
	  their respective serial ports; interrupts 4, 3, 5, and 9 are fairly
	  common interrupt request lines.  Also note that regular serial ports
	  <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> share interrupts on ISA-bus PCs
	  (multiport boards have on-board electronics that allow all the
	  16550A's on the board to share one or two interrupt request
	  lines).</para>
      </note>
	  
      <para>When you are finished adjusting the kernel configuration file, use
	the program <command>config</command> as documented in &ldquo;Building
	Berkeley Kernels with Config&rdquo; and the
	  &man.config.8; manual page to prepare a kernel building directory,
	then build, install, and test the new kernel.</para>

      <title>Device Special Files</title>
      
      <para>Most devices in the kernel are accessed through &ldquo;device

	devices are accessed through the

	and <filename>/dev/cua0<replaceable>?</replaceable></filename>
	(call-out) devices.  On FreeBSD version 1.1.5 and higher, there are

	parameters each time a port is opened, such as
	<literal>crtscts</literal> for modems which use
	<literal>CTS/RTS</literal> signaling for flow control.  The locking
	devices are used to lock flags on ports to prevent users or programs
	changing certain parameters; see the manual pages &man.termios.4;,
	  &man.sio.4;, and &man.stty.1; for

	<title>Making Device Special Files</title>

	<para>A shell script called <command>MAKEDEV</command> in the
	  <filename>/dev</filename> directory manages the device special
	  files.  (The manual page for &man.MAKEDEV.8; on FreeBSD 1.1.5 is
	  fairly bogus in its discussion of <acronym>COM</acronym> ports, so
	  ignore it.)  To use <command>MAKEDEV</command> to make dialup device
	  special files for <devicename>COM1:</devicename> (port 0),
	  <command>cd</command> to <filename>/dev</filename> and issue the
	  command <command>MAKEDEV ttyd0</command>. Likewise, to make dialup
	  device special files for <devicename>COM2:</devicename> (port 1),
	  use <command>MAKEDEV ttyd1</command>.</para>
	    
	<para><command>MAKEDEV</command> not only creates the
	  <filename>/dev/ttyd<replaceable>?</replaceable></filename> device
	  special files, but also creates the
	  <filename>/dev/cua0<replaceable>?</replaceable></filename> (and all
	  of the initializing and locking special files under FreeBSD 1.1.5
	  and up) and removes the hardwired terminal special file
	  <filename>/dev/tty0<replaceable>?</replaceable></filename>, if it
	  exists.</para>
	    
	<para>After making new device special files, be sure to check the
	  permissions on the files (especially the
	  <filename>/dev/cua*</filename> files) to make sure that only users
	  who should have access to those device special files can read &amp;
	  write on them &mdash; you probably do not want to allow your average
	  user to use your modems to dialout.  The default permissions on the
	  <filename>/dev/cua*</filename> files should be sufficient:</para>
	    
	<screen>crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 129 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cua01
crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 161 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cuai01
crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 193 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cual01</screen>
	    
	<para>These permissions allow the user <username>uucp</username> and
	  users in the group <username>dialer</username> to use the call-out
	  devices.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration Files</title>
      
      <para>There are three system configuration files in the
	<filename>/etc</filename> directory that you will probably need to
	edit to allow dialup access to your FreeBSD system.  The first,
	<filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>, contains configuration information
	for the <filename>/usr/libexec/getty</filename> daemon.  Second,
	<filename>/etc/ttys</filename> holds information that tells
	<filename>/sbin/init</filename> what <filename>tty</filename> devices
	should have <command>getty</command> processes running on them.
	Lastly, you can place port initialization commands in the
	<filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename> script if you have FreeBSD 1.1.5.1
	or higher; otherwise, you can initialize ports in the
	<filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> script.</para>
	  
      <para>There are two schools of thought regarding dialup modems on UNIX.
	One group likes to configure their modems and system so that no matter
	at what speed a remote user dials in, the local computer-to-modem
	RS-232 interface runs at a locked speed.  The benefit of this
	configuration is that the remote user always sees a system login
	prompt immediately.  The downside is that the system does not know
	what a user's true data rate is, so full-screen programs like Emacs
	will not adjust their screen-painting methods to make their response
	better for slower connections.</para>
	  
      <para>The other school configures their modems' RS-232 interface to vary
	its speed based on the remote user's connection speed.  For example,
	V.32bis (14.4 Kbps) connections to the modem might make the modem run
	its RS-232 interface at 19.2 Kbps, while 2400 bps connections make the
	modem's RS-232 interface run at 2400 bps. Because
	<command>getty</command> does not understand any particular modem's
	connection speed reporting, <command>getty</command> gives a
	<prompt>login:</prompt> message at an initial speed and watches the
	characters that come back in response.  If the user sees junk, it is
	assumed that they know they should press the
	<literal>&lt;Enter&gt;</literal> key until they see a recognizable
	prompt.  If the data rates do not match, <command>getty</command> sees
	anything the user types as &ldquo;junk&rdquo;, tries going to the next
	speed and gives the <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt again.  This
	procedure can continue ad nauseum, but normally only takes a keystroke
	or two before the user sees a good prompt.  Obviously, this login
	sequence does not look as clean as the former
	&ldquo;locked-speed&rdquo; method, but a user on a low-speed
	connection should receive better interactive response from full-screen
	programs.</para>
	  
      <para>The author will try to give balanced configuration information,
	but is biased towards having the modem's data rate follow the
	connection rate.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title><filename>/etc/gettytab</filename></title>

	<para><filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> is a &man.termcap.5;-style
	  file of configuration information for &man.getty.8;.  Please see the
	    &man.gettytab.5; manual page for complete information on the
	  format of the file and the list of capabilities.</para>

	  <title>Locked-Speed Config</title>

	    probably use the existing <literal>D2400</literal> entry.  This
	    entry already exists in the FreeBSD 1.1.5.1

      <title>My stock Hayes modem is not supported, what can I do?</title>
      
      <para>Actually, the man page for <command>tip</command> is out of date.
	There is a generic Hayes dialer already built in. Just use
	<literal>at=hayes</literal> in your <filename>/etc/remote</filename>
	file.</para>
	  
      <para>The Hayes driver is not smart enough to recognize some of the
	advanced features of newer modems&mdash;messages like
	<literal>BUSY</literal>, <literal>NO DIALTONE</literal>, or
	<literal>CONNECT 115200</literal> will just confuse it.  You should
	turn those messages off when you use <command>tip</command> (using
	<command>ATX0&amp;W</command>).</para>
	  
      <para>Also, the dial timeout for <command>tip</command> is 60 seconds.
	Your modem should use something less, or else tip will think there is
	a communication problem.  Try <command>ATS7=45&amp;W</command>.</para>
	  
      <para>Actually, as shipped <command>tip</command> does not yet support
	it fully.  The solution is to edit the file
	<filename>tipconf.h</filename> in the directory
	<filename>/usr/src/usr.bin/tip/tip</filename> Obviously you need the

      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <para>The FreeBSD/i386 operating system can boot on a system with  only
	a dumb terminal on a serial port as a console.  Such a configuration
	should be useful for two classes of people; system administrators who
	wish to install FreeBSD on a dedicated file/compute/terminal server
	machines that have no keyboard or monitor attached, and developers who
	want to debug the kernel or device drivers.</para>
  
      <para>Starting from version 3.1, FreeBSD/i386 employs a three stage
	bootstrap.  The first two stages are in the boot block code which is
	stored at the beginning of the FreeBSD slice on the boot disk.  The
	boot block will then load and run the boot loader
	(<filename>/boot/loader</filename>) as the third stage code. (See
	&man.boot.8; and &man.loader.8; for more details on the boot
	process.)</para>
  
      <para>In order to set up the serial console you must configure the boot
	block code, the boot loader code and the kernel.</para>
      
      <para>In FreeBSD version 3.0, the boot loader does not exist and there
	are only two stages in the bootstrap; the boot blocks directly load
	the kernel into memory.  If you are using FreeBSD 3.0, then you should
	disregard any reference to the boot loader in this section.  You can
	still use the serial port as a console.</para>
  
      <para>FreeBSD versions 2.X are quite different from 3.X, in that the
	serial port driver, &man.sio.4;, must be configured in a different
	way.  This chapter will not describe the settings for version 2.X
	systems.  If you are using these older versions of FreeBSD, please
	consult <filename>/sys/i386/boot/biosboot/README.serial</filename>
	instead.</para>

	<step>
	  <para>Unplug your keyboard.</para>
	  
	  <para>Most PC systems probe for the keyboard during the Power-On
	    Self-Test (POST) and will generate an error if the keyboard is not
	    detected.  Some machines complain loudly about the lack of a
	    keyboard and will not continue to boot until it is plugged
	    in.</para>
    
	  <para>If your computer complains about the error, but boots anyway,
	    then you do not have to do anything special.  (One machine with a
	    Phoenix BIOS that I have here merely says <errorname>Keyboard
	      failed</errorname> then continues to boot normally.)</para>

	  <para>If your computer refuses to boot without a keyboard attached
	    then you will have to configure the BIOS so that it ignores this
	    error (if it can).  Consult your motherboard's manual for details
	    on how to do this.</para>
	  
	  <tip>
	    <para>Setting the keyboard to &ldquo;Not installed&rdquo; in the
	      BIOS setup does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that you will not
	      be able to use your keyboard.  All this does is tell the BIOS
	      not to probe for a keyboard at power-on so that it will not
	      complain if the keyboard is not plugged in.  You can leave the
	      keyboard plugged in even with this flag set to &ldquo;Not
	      installed&rdquo; and the keyboard will still work.</para>
	  </tip>
	  
	  <note>
	    <para>If your system has a PS/2 mouse, chances are very good  that
	      you may have to unplug your mouse as well as your keyboard.
	      This is because PS/2 mice share some hardware with the keyboard,
	      and leaving the mouse plugged in can fool the keyboard probe
	      into thinking the keyboard is still there.  It is said that a
	      Gateway 2000 Pentium 90Mhz system with an AMI BIOS that behaves
	      this way.  In general this is not a problem since the mouse is
	      not much good without the keyboard anyway.</para>

	    you do not have a <devicename>COM1:</devicename>
	    (<devicename>sio0</devicename>), get one.  At this time, there is
	    no way to select a port other than <devicename>COM1:</devicename>
	    for the boot blocks without recompiling the boot blocks.  If you
	    are already using <devicename>COM1:</devicename> for another
	    device, you will have to temporarily remove that device and
	    install a new boot block and kernel once you get FreeBSD up and
	    running. (It is assumed that <devicename>COM1:</devicename> will
	    be available on a file/compute/terminal server anyway; if you

      <title>Changing Console from the Boot Loader</title>
      
      <para>Previous sections described how to set up the serial console by
	tweaking the boot block.  This section shows that you can specify the
	console by entering some commands and environment variables in the
	boot loader.  As the boot loader is invoked as the third stage of the

	will override the settings in the boot block.</para>

	<title>Setting Up the Serial Console</title>

	<para>You can easily specify the boot loader and the kernel to use the
	  serial console by writing just one line in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>:</para>
  
	<programlisting>set console=comconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>This will take effect regardless of the settings in the boot
	  block discussed in the previous section.</para>
  
	<para>You had better put the above line as the first line of
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> so as to see boot messages  on
	  the serial console as early as possible.</para>
  
	<para>Likewise, you can specify the internal console as:</para>

	<programlisting>set console=vidconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>If you do not set the boot loader environment variable
	  <envar>console</envar>, the boot loader, and subsequently the
	  kernel, will use whichever console indicated by the
	  <option>-h</option> option in the  boot block.</para>
  
	<para>In versions 3.2 or later, you may specify the console in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf.local</filename> or
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, rather than in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>.  In this method your
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> should look like:</para>
  
	<programlisting>include /boot/loader.4th
start</programlisting>
  
	<para>Then, create <filename>/boot/loader.conf.local</filename>  and
	  put the following line there.</para>
  
	<programlisting>console=comconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>or</para>

	<programlisting>console=vidconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>See &man.loader.conf.5; for more information.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>At the moment, the boot loader has no option equivalent to the

      <para>The idea here is to allow people to set up dedicated servers  that
	require no graphics hardware or attached keyboards.  Unfortunately,
	while (most?) every system will let you boot without a keyboard, there
	are quite a few that will not let you boot without a graphics adapter.
	Machines with AMI BIOSes can be configured to  boot with no graphics
	adapter installed simply by changing the `graphics adapter' setting in
	the CMOS configuration to `Not installed.'</para>
  
      <para>However, many machines do not support this option and will refuse
	to boot if you have no display hardware in the system.  With these
	machines, you'll have to leave some kind of graphics card plugged in,
	(even if it's just a junky mono board) although you will not have to
	attach a monitor into it. You might also try installing an AMI
	BIOS.</para>

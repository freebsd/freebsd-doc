    <para>FreeBSD is a state of the art operating system for computer
      systems based on both the Intel CPU architecture, which includes the
      386 and 486 and Pentium processors (both SX and DX versions) and the DEC
      Alpha architecture.  Intel compatible CPUs from AMD to Cyrix are
      supported as well.  FreeBSD provides you with many advanced features
      previously available only on much more expensive computers.
      These features include:</para>

    <para>FreeBSD is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite2 release from Computer Systems
      Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley, and
      carries on the distinguished tradition of BSD systems development.  In
      addition to the fine work provided by CSRG, the FreeBSD Project has put
      in many thousands of hours in fine tuning the system for maximum
      performance and reliability in real-life load situations.  As many of
      the commercial giants struggle to field PC operating systems with such
      features, performance and reliability, FreeBSD can offer them
      <emphasis>now</emphasis>!</para>
	
    <para>The applications to which FreeBSD can be put are truly limited only
      by your own imagination.  From software development to factory
      automation, inventory control to azimuth correction of remote satellite
      antennae; if it can be done with a commercial UNIX product then it is
      more than likely that you can do it with FreeBSD, too! FreeBSD also
      benefits significantly from the literally thousands of high quality
      applications developed by research centers and universities around the
      world, often available at little to no cost. Commercial applications are
      also available and appearing in greater numbers every day.</para>
	
    <para>Because the source code for FreeBSD itself is generally available,
      the system can also be customized to an almost unheard of degree for
      special applications or projects, and in ways not generally possible
      with operating systems from most major commercial vendors.  Here is just
      a sampling of some of the applications in which people are currently
      using FreeBSD:</para>

      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Research:</emphasis> With source code for the entire

	  operating systems as well as other branches of computer science.
	  FreeBSD's freely available nature also makes it possible for remote

	  many applications to be run locally, if desired, thus relieving the
	  burden on a central server.  FreeBSD can even boot

    <title>A Brief History of FreeBSD</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <para>The FreeBSD project had its genesis in the early part of 1993,
      partially as an outgrowth of the &ldquo;Unofficial 386BSD
      Patchkit&rdquo; by the patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate Williams,
      Rod Grimes and myself.</para>
    
    <para>Our original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of 386BSD
      in order to fix a number of problems with it that the patchkit mechanism
      just was not capable of solving.  Some of you may remember the early
      working title for the project being &ldquo;386BSD 0.5&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;386BSD Interim&rdquo; in reference to that fact.</para>
    
    <para>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up to that
      point suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth of neglect.
      As the patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with each passing day,
      we were in unanimous agreement that something had to be done and decided
      to try and assist Bill by providing this interim &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo;
      snapshot.  Those plans came to a rude halt when Bill Jolitz suddenly
      decided to withdraw his sanction from the project and without any clear
      indication of what would be done instead.</para>
	
    <para>It did not take us long to decide that the goal remained worthwhile,
      even without Bill's support, and so we adopted the name
      &ldquo;FreeBSD&rdquo;, coined by David Greenman.  Our initial objectives
      were set after consulting with the system's current users and, once it
      became clear that the project was on the road to perhaps even becoming a
      reality, I contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with an eye towards improving
      FreeBSD's distribution channels for those many unfortunates without easy
      access to the Internet.  Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported the idea
      of distributing FreeBSD on CD but went so far as to provide the project
      with a machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  Without
      Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what was,
      at the time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that
      FreeBSD would have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today.</para>
	
    <para>The first CDROM (and general net-wide) distribution was FreeBSD 1.0,
      released in December of 1993.  This was based on the 4.3BSD-Lite
      (&ldquo;Net/2&rdquo;) tape from U.C. Berkeley, with many components also
      provided by 386BSD and the Free Software Foundation.  It was a fairly
      reasonable success for a first offering, and we followed it with the
      highly successful FreeBSD 1.1 release in May of 1994.</para>
	
    <para>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on the
      horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running lawsuit
      over the legal status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape.  A condition of that
      settlement was U.C. Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were
      &ldquo;encumbered&rdquo; code and the property of Novell, who had in
      turn acquired it from AT&amp;T some time previously.  What Berkeley got
      in return was Novell's &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; that the 4.4BSD-Lite
      release, when it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered
      and all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to switch.
      This included FreeBSD, and the project was given until the end of July
      1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product.  Under the terms of
      that agreement, the project was allowed one last release before the
      deadline, that release being FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.</para>
	
    <para>FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally re-inventing
      itself from a completely new and rather incomplete set of 4.4BSD-Lite
      bits.  The &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; releases were light in part because
      Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks of code required for actually
      constructing a bootable running system (due to various legal
      requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was highly
      incomplete.  It took the project until November of 1994 to make this
      transition, at which point it released FreeBSD 2.0 to the net
      and on CDROM (in late December).  Despite being still more than a little
      rough around the edges, the release was a significant success and was
      followed by the more robust and easier to install FreeBSD 2.0.5 release
      in June of 1995.</para>
	
    <para>We released FreeBSD 2.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared to be
      popular enough among the ISP and commercial communities that another
      release along the 2.1-stable branch was merited.  This was FreeBSD
      2.1.7.1, released in February 1997 and capping the end of mainstream
      development on 2.1-stable.  Now in maintenance mode, only security
      enhancements and other critical bug fixes will be done on this branch
      (RELENG_2_1_0).</para>
	
    <para>FreeBSD 2.2 was branched from the development mainline
      (&ldquo;-current&rdquo;) in November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2 branch, and
      the first full release (2.2.1) was released in April, 1997.  Further
      releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the Summer and Fall of '97,
      the latest being 2.2.7 which appeared in late July of '98. The first
      official 3.0 release appeared in October, 1998 and the last release on
      the 2.2 branch, 2.2.8, appeared in November, 1998.</para>

    <para>The tree branched again on Jan 20, 1999.  This led to 4.0-current
      and a 3.x-stable branch, from which 3.1 was released on February
      15th, 1999 and 3.2 was released on May 15, 1999.</para>

    <para>Long term development projects will continue to take place in the
      4.0-current branch and SNAPshot releases of 4.0 on CDROM (and, of
      course, on the net).</para>

    <title>FreeBSD Project Goals</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <para>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may be
      used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of us have a
      significant investment in the code (and project) and would certainly not
      mind a little financial compensation now and then, but we are definitely
      not prepared to insist on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
      &ldquo;mission&rdquo; is to provide code to any and all comers, and for
      whatever purpose, so that the code gets the widest possible use and
      provides the widest possible benefit.  This is, I believe, one of the
      most fundamental goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
      support.</para>
	
    <para>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU General Public
      License (GPL) or Library General Public License (LGPL) comes with slightly
      more strings attached, though at least on the side of enforced access
      rather than the usual opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that
      can evolve in the commercial use of GPL software, we do, however,
      endeavor to replace such software with submissions under the more
      relaxed BSD copyright when reasonable to do so.</para>

      Alpha based computer systems.  It is based primarily on software from U.C.
      Berkeley's CSRG group, with some enhancements from NetBSD, OpenBSD, 386BSD,
      and the Free Software Foundation.</para>
	
    <para>Since our release of FreeBSD 2.0 in late 94, the performance,
      feature set, and stability of FreeBSD has improved dramatically.  The
      largest change is a revamped virtual memory system with a merged VM/file
      buffer  cache that not only increases performance, but reduces FreeBSD's
      memory footprint, making a 5MB configuration a more acceptable minimum.
      Other enhancements include full NIS client and server support,
      transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP, an improved SCSI subsystem,
      ISDN support, support for ATM, FDDI and Fast Ethernet (100Mbit)
      adapters, improved support for the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and narrow) and
      many hundreds of bug fixes.</para>
	
    <para>We have also taken the comments and suggestions of many of our users
      to heart and have attempted to provide what we hope is a more sane and
      easily understood installation process.  Your feedback on this
      (constantly evolving) process is especially welcome!</para>
	
    <para>In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a new ported
      software collection with hundreds of commonly sought-after programs.  By
      mid-September 1999, there were more than 2600 ports!  The list of
      ports ranges from http (WWW) servers, to games, languages, editors and
      almost everything in between.  The entire ports collection requires
      approximately 50MB of storage, all ports being  expressed as
      &ldquo;deltas&rdquo; to their original sources.  This makes  it much
      easier for us to update ports, and greatly reduces the disk space
      demands made by the older 1.0 ports collection.  To compile a port, you
      simply change to the directory of the program you wish to install, type
      <command>make all</command> followed by <command>make install</command>
      after successful compilation and let the system do the rest.  The full
      original distribution for each port you build is retrieved dynamically
      off the CDROM or a local ftp site, so you need only enough disk space to
      build the ports you want.  (Almost) every port is also provided as a
      pre-compiled &ldquo;package&rdquo; which can be installed with a simple
      command (pkg_add) by those who do not wish to compile their own ports
      from source.</para>
	
    <para>A number of additional documents which you may find very helpful in
      the process of installing and using FreeBSD may now also be found in the
      <filename>/usr/share/doc</filename> directory on any machine running
      FreeBSD 2.1 or later.  You may view the locally installed manuals with
      any HTML capable browser using the following URLs:</para>

    <para>The core of FreeBSD does not contain DES code which would inhibit
      its being exported outside the United States.  There is an add-on
      package to the core distribution, for use only in the United States,
      that contains the programs that normally use DES.  The auxiliary
      packages provided separately can be used by anyone.  A freely (from
      outside the U.S.) exportable European distribution of DES for our
      non-U.S.  users also exists and is described in the <ulink
	url="../FAQ/FAQ.html">FreeBSD FAQ</ulink>.</para>
	
    <para>If password security for FreeBSD is all you need, and you have no
      requirement for copying encrypted passwords from different hosts (Suns,
      DEC machines, etc) into FreeBSD password entries, then FreeBSD's MD5
      based security may be all you require! We feel that our default security
      model is more than a match for DES, and without any messy export issues
      to deal with.  If you are outside (or even inside) the U.S., give it a
      try!</para>

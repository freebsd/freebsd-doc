    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>FreeBSD is under constant development between releases.  For
      people who want to be on the cutting edge, there are several easy
      mechanisms for keeping your system in sync with the latest
      developments.  Be warned&mdash;the cutting edge is not for everyone!
      This chapter will help you decide if you want to track the
      development system, or stick with one of the released
      versions.</para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="current-stable">
    <title>-CURRENT vs. -STABLE</title>

    <para>There are two development branches to FreeBSD; -CURRENT and
      -STABLE.  This section will explain a bit about each and describe
      how to keep your system up-to-date with each respective tree.
      -CURRENT will be discussed first, then -STABLE.</para>

    <sect2 id="current">
      <title>Staying Current with FreeBSD</title>

      <para>As you are reading this, keep in mind that -CURRENT is the
	<quote>bleeding edge</quote> of FreeBSD development and that if you
	are new to FreeBSD, you are most likely going to want to think
	twice about running it.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>What is FreeBSD-CURRENT?</title>

	<para>FreeBSD-CURRENT is, quite literally, nothing more than a
	  daily snapshot of the working sources for FreeBSD.  These
	  include work in progress, experimental changes and transitional
	  mechanisms that may or may not be present in the next official
	  release of the software.  While many of us compile almost daily
	  from FreeBSD-CURRENT sources, there are periods of time when the
	  sources are literally un-compilable.  These problems are
	  generally resolved as expeditiously as possible, but whether or
	  not FreeBSD-CURRENT sources bring disaster or greatly desired
	  functionality can literally be a matter of which part of any
	  given 24 hour period you grabbed them in!</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Who needs FreeBSD-CURRENT?</title>

	<para>FreeBSD-CURRENT is made generally available for 3 primary
	  interest groups:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Members of the FreeBSD group who are actively working on
	      some part of the source tree and for whom keeping
	      <quote>current</quote> is an absolute requirement.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Members of the FreeBSD group who are active testers,
	      willing to spend time working through problems in order to
	      ensure that FreeBSD-CURRENT remains as sane as possible.
	      These are also people who wish to make topical suggestions
	      on changes and the general direction of FreeBSD.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Peripheral members of the FreeBSD (or some other) group
	      who merely wish to keep an eye on things and use the current
	      sources for reference purposes (e.g. for
	      <emphasis>reading</emphasis>, not running).  These people
	      also make the occasional comment or contribute code.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>What is FreeBSD-CURRENT <emphasis>not</emphasis>?</title>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A fast-track to getting pre-release bits because you
	      heard there is some cool new feature in there and you want
	      to be the first on your block to have it.</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>In any way <quote>officially supported</quote> by us.
	      We do our best to help people genuinely in one of the 3
	      <quote>legitimate</quote> FreeBSD-CURRENT categories, but we
	      simply <emphasis>do not have the time</emphasis> to provide
	      tech support for it.  This is not because we are mean and
	      nasty people who do not like helping people out (we would
	      not even be doing FreeBSD if we were), it is literally
	      because we cannot answer 400 messages a day
	      <emphasis>and</emphasis> actually work on FreeBSD!  Given the
	      choice between improving FreeBSD and answering lots of
	      questions, most developers, and users, would probably opt for
	      the former.</para>

	<title>Using FreeBSD-CURRENT</title>
      
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Join the &a.current; and the &a.cvsall; .  This is not
	      just a good idea, it is <emphasis>essential</emphasis>.  If
	      you are not on the <emphasis>FreeBSD-CURRENT</emphasis>
	      mailing list, you will not see the comments that people are
	      making about the current state of the system and thus will
	      probably end up stumbling over a lot of problems that others
	      have already found and solved.  Even more importantly, you
	      will miss out on important bulletins which may be critical
	      to your system's continued health.</para>

	    <para>The &a.cvsall; mailing list will allow you to see the
	      commit log entry for each change as it is made along with
	      any pertinent information on possible side-effects.</para>

	    <para>To join these lists, send mail to &a.majordomo; and
	      specify the following in the body of your message:</para>

	    <programlisting>subscribe freebsd-current
subscribe cvs-all</programlisting>

	    <para>Optionally, you can also say <literal>help</literal>
	      and Majordomo will send you full help on how to subscribe
	      and unsubscribe to the various other mailing lists we
	      support.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Grab the sources from <hostid
	      role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>.  You can do this in
	      one of three ways:</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>Use the <link linkend="cvsup">cvsup</link> program
		  with <ulink
		  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/examples/cvsup/standard-supfile">this
		  supfile</ulink>.  This is the second most recommended
		  method, since it allows  you to grab the entire
		  collection once and then only what has changed from then
		  on.  Many people run cvsup from cron and keep their
		  sources up-to-date automatically.  For a fairly easy
		  interface to this, simply type:</para>

		<blockquote><screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -f \
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/development/CVSup/cvsupit.tgz</userinput></screen></blockquote>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Use <command>ftp</command>.  The source tree for
		  FreeBSD-CURRENT is always <quote>exported</quote> on:
		  <ulink
		  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/</ulink>.
		  We also use <command>wu-ftpd</command> which allows
		  compressed/tarred grabbing of whole trees.  e.g. you
		  see:</para>

		<screen>usr.bin/lex</screen>

		<para>You can do the following to get the whole directory
		  as a tar file:</para>

		<screen><prompt>ftp&gt;</prompt> <userinput>cd usr.bin</userinput>
<prompt>ftp&gt;</prompt> <userinput>get lex.tar</userinput></screen>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Use the <application><link
		  linkend="ctm">CTM</link></application> facility.  If you
		  have very bad connectivity (high price connections or
		  only e-mail access) <application>CTM</application> is an option.
		  However, it is a lot of hassle and can give you broken files.
		  This leads to it being rarely used, which again increases
		  the chance of it not working for fairly long periods of
		  time.  We recommend using
		  <application><link linkend="cvsup">CVSup</link></application>
		  for anybody with a 9600bps modem or faster connection.

	    </orderedlist>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you are grabbing the sources to run, and not just
	      look at, then grab <emphasis>all</emphasis> of current, not
	      just selected portions.  The reason for this is that various
	      parts of the source depend on updates elsewhere, and trying
	      to compile just a subset is almost guaranteed to get you
	      into trouble.</para>

	    <para>Before compiling current, read the
	      <filename>Makefile</filename>in <filename>/usr/src</filename>
	      carefully.  You should at least run a <link

      <title>Staying Stable with FreeBSD</title>

      <para>If you are using FreeBSD in a production environment and want
	to make sure you have the latest fixes from the -CURRENT branch,
	you want to be running -STABLE.  This is the tree that -RELEASEs

	<quote>snapshot</quote> from the -STABLE branch that we put on

	branch.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>What is FreeBSD-STABLE?</title>

	<para>FreeBSD-STABLE is our development branch for a more low-key
	  and conservative set of changes intended for our next mainstream
	  release.  Changes of an experimental or untested nature do not

	<title>Who needs FreeBSD-STABLE?</title>

	<para>If you are a commercial user or someone who puts maximum
	  stability of their FreeBSD system before all other concerns, you
	  should consider tracking <emphasis>stable</emphasis>.  This is

	  (<ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">&rel.current;-RELEASE</ulink>
	  at the time of this writing) since the

	  stream relative to the previous release.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>The <emphasis>stable</emphasis> tree endeavors, above all,
	    to be fully compilable and stable at all times, but we do
	    occasionally make mistakes (these are still active sources
	    with quickly-transmitted updates, after all).  We also do our
	    best to thoroughly test fixes in <emphasis>current</emphasis>
	    before bringing them into <emphasis>stable</emphasis>, but
	    sometimes our tests fail to catch every case.  If something

  <sect1 id="synching">
    <title>Synchronizing Your Source</title>
    
    <para>There are various ways of using an Internet (or email)
      connection to stay up-to-date with any given area of the FreeBSD
      project sources, or all areas, depending on what interests you.  The
      primary services we offer are <link linkend="anoncvs">Anonymous
      CVS</link>, <link linkend="cvsup">CVSup</link>, and <link
      linkend="ctm">CTM</link>.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>While it is possible to update only parts of your source tree,
        the only supported update procedure is to update the entire tree
        and recompile both userland (i.e., all the programs that run in
        user space, such as those in <filename>/bin</filename> and
        <filename>/sbin</filename>) and kernel sources.  Updating only part
        of your source tree, only the kernel, or only userland will often
        result in problems.  These problems may range from compile errors
        to kernel panics or data corruption.</para>
    </warning>

    <para><application>Anonymous CVS</application> and
      <application>CVSup</application> use the <emphasis>pull</emphasis>
      model of updating sources.  In the case of
      <application>CVSup</application> the user (or a cron script) invokes
      the <command>cvsup</command> program, and it interacts with a
      <command>cvsupd</command> server somewhere to bring your files
      up-to-date.  The updates you receive are up-to-the-minute and you
      get them when, and only when, you want them.  You can easily
      restrict your updates to the specific files or directories that are
      of interest to you.  Updates are generated on the fly by the server,
      according to what you have and what you want to have.
      <application>Anonymous CVS</application> is quite a bit more
      simplistic than CVSup in that it's just an extension to
      <application>CVS</application> which allows it to pull changes
      directly from a remote CVS repository.
      <application>CVSup</application> can do this far more efficiently,
      but <application>Anonymous CVS</application> is easier to
      use.</para>

    <para><application>CTM</application>, on the other hand, does not
      interactively compare the sources you have with those on the master
      archive or otherwise pull them across..  Instead, a script which
      identifies changes in files since its previous run is executed
      several times a day on the master CTM machine, any detected changes
      being compressed, stamped with a sequence-number and encoded for
      transmission over email (in printable ASCII only).  Once received,
      these <quote>CTM deltas</quote> can then be handed to the
      &man.ctm.rmail.1; utility which will automatically decode, verify
      and apply the changes to the user's copy of the sources.  This
      process is far more efficient than <application>CVSup</application>,
      and places less strain on our server resources since it is a
      <emphasis>push</emphasis> rather than a <emphasis>pull</emphasis>
      model.</para>

    <para>There are other trade-offs, of course.  If you inadvertently
      wipe out portions of your archive, <application>CVSup</application>
      will detect and rebuild the damaged portions for you.
      <application>CTM</application> won't do this, and if you wipe some
      portion of your source tree out (and don't have it backed up) then
      you will have to start from scratch (from the most recent CVS
      <quote>base delta</quote>) and rebuild it all with CTM or, with
      anoncvs, simply delete the bad bits and resync.</para>

    <para>More information about <application>Anonymous CVS</application>,

      <title>Update <filename>/etc/group</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>/etc</filename> directory contains a large part
	of your system's configuration information, as well as scripts
	that are run at system startup.  Some of these scripts change from
	version to version of FreeBSD.</para>

      <para>Some of the configuration files are also used in the day to
	day running of the system.  In particular,
	<filename>/etc/group</filename>.</para>

      <para>There have been occasions when the installation part of
        <quote>make world</quote> has expected certain usernames or groups
	to exist.  When performing an upgrade it is likely that these
	groups did not exist. This caused problems when upgrading.</para>

      <para>The most recent example of this is when the <quote/ppp/ group
	(later renamed <quote/network/) was added.  Users had the
	installation process fail for them when parts of the
	<filename>ppp</filename> subsystem were installed using a
	non-existent (for them) group name.</para>

      <para>The solution is to examine
	<filename>/usr/src/etc/group</filename> and compare its list of
	groups with your own.  If there are any groups in the new file that
	are not in your file then copy them over.  Similarly, you should
	rename any groups in <filename>/etc/group</filename> which have
	the same GID but a different name to those in
	<filename>/usr/src/etc/group</filename>.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>If you are feeling particularly paranoid, you can check your
	  system to see which files are owned by the group you are
	  renaming or deleting.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>find / -group <replaceable>GID</replaceable> -print</userinput></screen>

	<para>will show all files owned by group
	  <replaceable>GID</replaceable> (which can be either a group name
	  or a numeric group ID).</para>

      <title>Drop to single user mode</title>

      <para>You may want to compile the system in single user mode.  Apart
	from the obvious benefit of making things go slightly faster,
	reinstalling the system will touch a lot of important system
	files, all the standard system binaries, libraries, include files
	and so on.  Changing these on a  running system (particularly if
	you have active users on the system at the time) is asking for
	trouble.</para>

      <para>Another method is to compile the system in multi-user mode, and
        then drop into single user mode for the installation.  If you would
        like to do it this way, simply hold off on the following steps until
        the build has completed.</para>

      <para>As the superuser, you can execute</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput/shutdown now/</screen>

      <para>from a running system, which will drop it to single user
	mode.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, reboot the system, and at the boot prompt,
        enter the <option>-s</option> flag.  The system will then boot
	single user.  At the shell prompt you should then run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fsck -p</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -u /</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -a -t ufs</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>swapon -a</userinput></screen>

      <para>This checks the filesystems, remounts <filename>/</filename>

      <para>You can speed up the <quote>make world</quote> process, and
	possibly  save yourself some dependency headaches by removing this

	<title>Saving the output</title>

	<para>It is a good idea to save the output you get from running
	  &man.make.1; to another file.  If something goes wrong you will
	  have a copy of the error message.  While this might not help you
	  in diagnosing what has gone wrong, it can help others if you post
	  your problem to one of the FreeBSD mailing lists.</para>

	<para>The easiest way to do this is to use the &man.script.1;
	  command, with a parameter that specifies the name of the file to
	  save all output to.  You would do this immediately before
	  rebuilding the world, and then type <userinput>exit</userinput>
	  when the process has finished.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>script /var/tmp/mw.out</userinput>
Script started, output file is /var/tmp/mw.out	 
&prompt.root; <userinput>make TARGET</userinput>
<emphasis>&hellip; compile, compile, compile &hellip;</emphasis>	  
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>
Script done, &hellip;</screen>

	<para>If you do this, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> save the output
	  in <filename>/tmp</filename>.  This directory may be cleared
	  next time you reboot.  A better place to store it is in
	  <filename>/var/tmp</filename> (as in the previous example) or
	  in <username>root</username>'s home directory.</para>

	<para>You must be in the <filename>/usr/src</filename>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput></screen>

	<para>(unless, of course, your source code is elsewhere, in which
	  case change to that directory instead).</para>

	<para>To rebuild the world you use the &man.make.1; command.  This
          command reads instructions from the <filename>Makefile</filename>,
          which describes how the programs that comprise FreeBSD should be
          rebuilt, the order in which they should be built, and so on.</para>

	<para>The general format of the command line you will type is as
	  follows:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make <option>-<replaceable/x/</option> <option>-D<replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable></option> <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>In this example, <option>-<replaceable>x</replaceable></option>
	  is an option that you would pass to &man.make.1;.  See the
	  &man.make.1; manual page for an example of the options you can
	  pass.</para>

	<para><option>-D<replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable></option>
	  passes a variable to the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  The
	  behavior of the <filename>Makefile</filename> is controlled by
	  these variables.  These are the same variables as are set in
	  <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>, and this provides another
	  way of setting them.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DNOPROFILE=true <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>is another way of specifying that profiled libraries should
	  not be built, and corresponds with the</para>

	<programlisting>NOPROFILE=    true
#    Avoid compiling profiled libraries</programlisting>

	<para>lines in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.</para>

	<para><replaceable>target</replaceable> tells &man.make.1; what
	  you want to do.  Each <filename>Makefile</filename> defines a
	  number of different <quote>targets</quote>, and your choice of
	  target determines what happens.</para>

	<para>Some targets are listed in the
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>, but are not meant for you to run.
	  Instead, they are used by the build process to break out the
	  steps necessary to rebuild the system into a number of
	  sub-steps.</para>

	<para>Most of the time you won't need to pass any parameters to
	    &man.make.1;, and so your command like will look like
	    this:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>Beginning with version 2.2.5 of FreeBSD (actually, it was
	  first created on the -CURRENT branch, and then retrofitted to
	  -STABLE midway between 2.2.2 and 2.2.5) the
	  <maketarget>world</maketarget> target has been split in
	  two.  <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> and
	  <maketarget>installworld</maketarget>.</para>

	<para>As the names imply, <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget>
	  builds a complete new tree under <filename>/usr/obj</filename>,
	  and <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> installs this tree on
	  the current machine.</para>

	<para>This is very useful for 2 reasons.  First, it allows you
	  to do the build safe in the knowledge that no components of
	  your running system will be affected.  The build is
	  <quote>self hosted</quote>.  Because of this, you can safely
	  run <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> on a machine running
	  in multi-user mode with no fear of ill-effects.  It is still
	  recommended that you run the
	  <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> part in single user
	  mode, though.</para>

	<para>Secondly, it allows you to use NFS mounts to upgrade 
	  multiple machines on your network.  If you have three machines,
	  A, B and C that you want to upgrade, run <command>make
	  buildworld</command> and <command>make installworld</command> on
	  A.  B and C should then NFS mount <filename>/usr/src</filename>
	  and <filename>/usr/obj</filename> from A, and you can then run
	  <command>make installworld</command> to install the results of 
	  the build on B and C.</para>

	<para>Although the <maketarget>world</maketarget> target still exists,
	  you are strongly encouraged not to use it.</para>

	<para>Run</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildworld</userinput></screen>
 
        <para>It is now possible to specify a -j option to
          <command>make</command> which will cause it to spawn several
          simultaneous processes.  This is most useful on multi-CPU machines.
          However, since much of the compiling process is IO bound rather
          than CPU bound it is also useful on single CPU machines.</para>

	<para>On a typical single-CPU machine you would run:</para>
	  
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -j4 buildworld</userinput></screen>

	<para>&man.make.1; will then have up to 4 processes running at any one
	  time.  Empirical evidence posted to the mailing lists shows this
	  generally gives the best performance benefit.</para>

	<para>If you have a multi-CPU machine and you are using an SMP
	  configured kernel try values between 6 and 10 and see how they speed
	  things up.</para>

	<para>Be aware that this is still somewhat experimental, and commits
	  to the source tree may occasionally break this feature.  If the
	  world fails to compile using this parameter try again without it
	  before you report any problems.</para>

	<title>Timings</title>

        <para>Many factors influence the build time, but currently a 500MHz
          Pentium 3 with 128MB of RAM takes about 3 and a half hours to build
          the -CURRENT tree, with no tricks or shortcuts used during the
          process.  A -STABLE tree will build somewhat faster.</para>

      <title>Compile and install a new kernel</title>

      <para>To take full advantage of your new system you should recompile the
	kernel.  This is practically a necessity, as certain memory structures
	may have changed, and programs like &man.ps.1; and &man.top.1; will
	fail to work until the kernel and source code versions are the
	same.</para>

      <para>The simplest, safest way to do this is to build and install a
	kernel based on <filename>GENERIC</filename>.  While
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> may not have all the necessary devices
	for your system, it should contain everything necessary to boot your
	system back to single user mode.  This is a good test that the new
	system works properly.  After booting from
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> and verifying that your system works you
	can then build a new kernel based on your normal kernel config
	file.</para>

      <para>If you are upgrading to FreeBSD 4.0 or above then the standard
	kernel build procedure (as described in <xref linkend="kernelconfig">)
	is deprecated.  Instead, you should run these commands.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildkernel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installkernel</userinput></screen>

      <para>If you are upgrading to a version of FreeBSD below 4.0 you should
	use the standard kernel build procedure.  However, it is recommended
	that you use the new version of &man.config.8;, using a command line
	like this.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Install the new system binaries</title>

      <para>If you were building a version of FreeBSD recent enough to have

      <para>Run</para>

      <note>
	<para>If you specified variables on the	  <command>make

	  variables in the <command>make installworld</command> command
	  line.  This does not necessarily hold true for other options;
	  for example, <option>-j</option> must never be used with
	  <maketarget>installworld</maketarget>.</para>
	
	<para>For example, if you ran:</para>

      <title>Update files not updated by <command>make world</command></title>
      
      <para>Remaking the world will not update certain directories (in
	particular, <filename>/etc</filename>, <filename>/var</filename> and
	<filename>/usr</filename>) with new or changed configuration files.</para>

      <para>The simplest way to update these files is to use
        &man.mergemaster.8;, though it is possible to do it manually
        if you would prefer to do that.  We strongly recommend you
        use &man.mergemaster.8;, however, and if you do then you
        can skip forward to the <link linkend="update-dev">next
        section</link>, since &man.mergemaster.8; is very simple to use.
        You should read the manual page first, and make a backup of
        <filename>/etc</filename> in case anything goes wrong.</para>

      <para>If you wish to do the update manually,
        you cannot just copy over the files from
	<filename>/usr/src/etc</filename> to <filename>/etc</filename> and
	have it work.  Some of these files must be <quote>installed</quote>
	first.  This is because the <filename>/usr/src/etc</filename>
	directory <emphasis>is not</emphasis> a copy of what your
	<filename>/etc</filename> directory should look like.  In addition,
	there  are files that should be in <filename>/etc</filename> that are
	not in <filename>/usr/src/etc</filename>.</para>

      <para>The simplest way to do this by hand is to install the files into a new
	directory, and then work through them looking for differences.</para>
    
      <warning>
	<title>Backup your existing <filename>/etc</filename></title>

	<para>Although, in theory, nothing is going to touch this directory
	  automatically, it is always better to be sure.  So copy your
	  existing <filename>/etc</filename> directory somewhere safe.
	  Something like:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp -Rp /etc /etc.old</userinput></screen>

	<para><option>-R</option> does a recursive copy, <option>-p</option>
	  preserves times, ownerships on files and suchlike.</para>
      </warning>
      
      <para>You need to build a dummy set of directories to install the new
	<filename>/etc</filename> and other files into.
	<filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> is a reasonable choice, and
	there are a number of subdirectories required under this as
	well.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/root</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/etc</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/root distrib-dirs distribution</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will build the necessary directory structure and install the
	files.  A lot of the subdirectories that have been created under
	<filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> are empty and should be deleted.
	The simplest way to do this is to:</para>
      
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /var/tmp/root</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>find -d . -type d | xargs rmdir 2&gt;/dev/null</userinput></screen>
      
      <para>This will remove all empty directories.  (Standard error is
        redirected to <filename>/dev/null</filename> to prevent the warnings
        about the directories that are not empty.)</para>

      <para><filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> now contains all the files that
	should be placed in appropriate locations below
	<filename>/</filename>.  You now have to go through each of these
	files, determining how they differ with your existing files.</para>
    
      <para>Note that some of the files that will have been installed in
	<filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> have a leading <quote/./.  At the
	time of writing the only files like this are shell startup files in
	<filename>/var/tmp/root/</filename> and
	<filename>/var/tmp/root/root/</filename>, although there may be others
	(depending on when you are reading this.  Make sure you use
	<command/ls -a/ to catch them.</para>
    
      <para>The simplest way to do this is to use &man.diff.1; to compare the
	two files.</para>
    
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>diff /etc/shells /var/tmp/root/etc/shells</userinput></screen>
      
      <para>This will show you the differences between your
	<filename>/etc/shells</filename> file and the new
	<filename>/etc/shells</filename> file.  Use these to decide whether to
	merge in changes that you have made or whether to copy over your old
	file.</para>

	<title>Name the new root directory
	  (<filename>/var/tmp/root</filename>) with a time stamp, so you can

	<para>Frequently rebuilding the world means that you have to update
	<filename>/etc</filename> frequently as well, which can be a bit of
	  a chore.</para>

	<para>You can speed this process up by keeping a copy of the last set

	  The  following procedure gives one idea of how to do this.</para>

	<procedure>

	    <para>Make the world as normal.  When you want to update

	      following.</para>
	  
	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/root-19980214</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/etc</userinput>

	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>When you have downloaded the latest version of the source
	      and remade it, follow step 1.  This will give you a new

	      between doing updates).</para>
	  </step>

&prompt.root; <userinput>diff -r root-19980214 root-19980221</userinput></screen>

	<step>
	  <para>Write another snapshot of the directory, this time to
	    <filename>/var/tmp/dev2.out</filename>.  Now look through these
	    two files for any devices that you missed creating.  There should
	    not be any, but it is better to be safe than sorry.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>diff /var/tmp/dev.out /var/tmp/dev2.out</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You are most likely to notice disk slice discrepancies which
	    will involve commands such as
	  
	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV sd0s1</userinput></screen>

	    to recreate the slice entries.  Your precise circumstances may

      <para>For the sake of completeness, you may want to update the files in
	<filename>/stand</filename> as well.  These files consist of hard
	links to the <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename> binary.  This
	binary should  be statically linked, so that it can work when no other
	filesystems (and  in particular <filename>/usr</filename>) have been

      <para>If things went slightly wrong, it is easy to rebuild a particular
        piece of the system.  For example, if you accidently deleted
        <filename>/etc/magic</filename> as part of the upgrade or merge of
        <filename>/etc</filename>, the &man.file.1; command will stop working.
        In this case, the fix would be to run:</para>

      <title/Questions?/

      <qandaset>
	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Do I need to re-make the world for every change?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
            <para>There is no easy answer to this one, as it depends on the
	      nature of the change.  For example, if you just ran CVSup, and
	      it has shown the following files as being updated,</para>
      
	    <screen><filename>src/games/cribbage/instr.c</filename>
<filename>src/games/sail/pl_main.c</filename>
<filename>src/release/sysinstall/config.c</filename>
<filename>src/release/sysinstall/media.c</filename>
<filename>src/share/mk/bsd.port.mk</filename></screen>

	    <para>it probably is not worth rebuilding the entire world.
	      You could just go to the appropriate sub-directories and
	      <command>make all install</command>, and that's about it.  But
	      if something major changed, for example
	      <filename>src/lib/libc/stdlib</filename> then you should either
	      re-make the world, or at least those parts of it that are
	      statically linked (as well as anything else you might have added
	      that is statically linked).</para>
      
	    <para>At the end of the day, it is your call.  You might be happy
	      re-making the world every fortnight say, and let changes
	      accumulate over that fortnight.  Or you might want to re-make
	      just those things that have changed, and are confident you can
	      spot all the dependencies.</para>
      
	    <para>And, of course, this all depends on how often you want to
	      upgrade, and whether you are tracking -STABLE or
	      -CURRENT.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>My compile failed with lots of signal 11 (or other signal
	      number) errors.  What has happened?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This is normally indicative of hardware problems.
	      (Re)making the world is an effective way to stress test your
	      hardware, and will frequently throw up memory problems.  These
	      normally manifest themselves as the compiler mysteriously dying
	      on receipt of strange signals.</para>
      
	    <para>A sure indicator of this is if you can restart the make and
	      it dies at a different point in the process.</para>
      
	    <para>In this instance there is little you can do except start
	      swapping around the components in your machine to determine
	      which one is failing.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can I remove <filename>/usr/obj</filename> when I have
	      finished?</para>
	  </question>
	  
	  <answer>
	    <para>The short answer is yes.</para>
      
	    <para><filename>/usr/obj</filename> contains all the object files
	      that were produced during the compilation phase.  Normally, one
	      of the first steps in the <quote/make world/ process is to
	      remove this directory and start afresh.  In this case, keeping
	      <filename>/usr/obj</filename> around after you have finished
	      makes little sense, and will free up a large chunk of disk space
	      (currently about 340MB).</para>
      
	    <para>However, if you know what you are doing you can have
	      <quote/make world/ skip this step.  This will make subsequent
	      builds run much faster, since most of sources will not need to
	      be recompiled.  The flip side of this is that subtle dependency
	      problems can creep in, causing your build to fail in odd ways.
	      This frequently generates noise on the FreeBSD mailing lists,
	      when one person complains that their build has failed, not
	      realising that it is because they have tried to cut
	      corners.</para>
      
	    <para>If you want to live dangerously then make the world, passing
	      the <makevar>NOCLEAN</makevar> definition to make, like
	      this:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DNOCLEAN world</userinput></screen>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can interrupted builds be resumed?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This depends on how far through the process you got before
	      you found a problem.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>In general</emphasis> (and this is not a hard and
	      fast rule) the <quote>make world</quote> process builds new
	      copies of essential tools (such as &man.gcc.1;, and
	      &man.make.1;) and the system libraries.  These tools and
	      libraries are then installed.  The new tools and libraries are
	      then used to rebuild themselves, and are installed again. The
	      entire system (now including regular user programs, such as
		&man.ls.1; or &man.grep.1;) is then rebuilt with the new
	      system files.</para>

	    <para>If you are at the last stage, and you know it (because you
	      have looked through the output that you were storing) then you
	      can (fairly safely) do</para>

	    <screen><emphasis>&hellip; fix the problem &hellip;</emphasis>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DNOCLEAN all</userinput></screen>

	    <para>This will not undo the work of the previous
	      <quote>make world</quote>.</para>

	    <para>If you see the message

	      <screen>--------------------------------------------------------------
Building everything..
--------------------------------------------------------------</screen>

	      in the <quote>make world</quote> output then it is
	      probably fairly safe to do so.</para>
	    
	    <para>If you do not see that message, or you are not sure, then it
	      is always better to be safe than sorry, and restart the build
	      from scratch.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can I use one machine as a <emphasis/master/ to upgrade lots
	      of machines (NFS)?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This is a fairly easy task, and can save hours of compile
              time for many machines.  Simply run the buildworld on a central
              machine, and then NFS mount <filename>/usr/src</filename> and
	      <filename>/usr/obj</filename> on the remote machine and
	      installworld there.</para>

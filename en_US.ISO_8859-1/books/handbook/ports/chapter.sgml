  <title>Installing Applications: Packages and Ports</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>There is only so much you can do with FreeBSD.  If you are an
      operating systems developer then the base system likely contains
      everything you need.  If that is not what you are planning to do with
      FreeBSD then you will probably want to install additional
      software&mdash;perhaps a web server, or a mail reader, or a graphical
      environment such as KDE or GNOME.</para>

    <para>If you have used a Unix system before you will know that the typical
      procedure for installing third party software goes something like
      this:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Download the software, which might be distributed in source code
	  format, or as a binary.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Unpack the software from its distribution format (typically a
	  tarball compressed with either &man.compress.1; or &man.gzip.1;).</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Locate the documentation (perhaps a <filename>README</filename>
	  file, or some files in a <filename>doc/</filename> subdirectory) and
	  read up on how to install the software.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>If the software was distributed in source format, compile it.
	  This may involve editing a <filename>Makefile</filename>, or
	  running a <command>configure</command> script, and other work.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Test and install the software.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>And that is only if everything goes well.  If you are installing a
      software package that was not deliberately ported to FreeBSD you may
      even have to go in and edit the code to make it work properly.</para>

    <para>Should you want to, you can continue to install software the
      <quote>traditional</quote> way with FreeBSD.  However, FreeBSD provides
      two technologies which can save you a lot of effort; packages and
      ports.  At the time of writing, over 4,000 third party applications have
      been made available in this way.</para>

    <para>For any given application, the FreeBSD package for that application
      is a single file which you must download.  The package contains
      pre-compiled copies of all the commands for the application, as well as
      any configuration files or documentation.  A downloaded package file can
      be manipulated with FreeBSD <literal>pkg_*</literal> commands, such as
      &man.pkg.add.1; &man.pkg.delete.1;, &man.pkg.info.1;, and so on.</para>

    <para>Installing a new application can be carried out with a single
      command.</para>

    <para>A FreeBSD port for an application is a collection of files designed
      to automate the process of compiling an application from source
      code.</para>

    <para>Remember that there are a number of steps you would normally carry
      out if you compiled a program yourself (unpacking, patching, compiling,
      installing).  The files that make up a port contain all the necessary
      information to alllow the system to do this for you.  You run a handful
      of simple commands and the source code for the application is
      automatically downloaded, extracted, patched, compiled, and installed
      for you.</para>

    <para>In fact, the ports system can also be used to generate packages
      which can later be manipulated with the <literal>pkg_*</literal>
      commands.</para>

    <para>Both packages and ports understand
      <emphasis>dependencies</emphasis>.  Suppose you want to install an
      application that depends on a specific library being installed.  Both
      the application and the library have been made available as FreeBSD
      ports and packages.  If you use the <command>pkg_add</command> command
      or the ports system to add the application, both will notice that the
      library has not been installed, and the commands will install the
      library first.</para>

    <para>Given that the two technologies are quite similar, you might be
      wondering why FreeBSD bothers with both.  Packages and ports both have
      their own strengths, and which one you use will depend on your own
      preference.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Package benefits</title>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than the
	  compressed tarball containing the source code for the application.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require any additional compilation.  For large
	  applications, such as <application>Mozilla</application>,
	  <application>KDE</application>, or <application>GNOME</application>
	  this can be important, particularly if you are on a slow system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require you to understand any of the process
	  involved in compiling software on FreeBSD.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Ports benefits</title>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>Packages are normally compiled with conservative options,
	  because they have to run on the maximum number of systems.  By
	  installing from the port, you can tweak the compilation options to
	  (for example) generate code that is specific to a 686 processor.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some packages have compile time options relating to what they
	  can and can't do.  For example, <application>Apache</application>
	  can be configured with a wide variety of different builtin options.
	  By building from the port you do not have to accept the default
	  options, and can set them yourself.</para>

	<para>In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same
	  application to specify certain settings.  For example,
	  <application>Ghostscript</application> is available as a
	  <filename>ghostscript</filename> package and a
	  <filename>ghostscript-nox11</filename> package, depending on whether
	  or not you have installed an X11 server.  This sort of rough
	  tweaking is possible with packages, but rapidly becomes impossible
	  if an application has more than one or two different compile time
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The licensing conditions of some software distributions forbid
	  binary distribution.  They must be distributed as source
	  code.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some people do not trust binary distributions.  At least with
	  source code, you can (in theory) read through it and look for
	  potential problems yourself.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you have local patches, you will need the source in order to
	  apply them.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some people like having code around, so they can read it if they
	  get bored, hack it, borrow from it (license permitting, of course),
	  and so on.</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>The remainder of this chapter will explain how to use packages and
      ports to install and manage third party software on FreeBSD.</para>

    <title>Finding your application</title>

    <para>Before you can install any applications you need to know what you
      want, and what the application is called.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD's list of available applications is growing all the time.
      Currently there are over 4,000 applications available as packages or
      ports.  There are a number of ways to find what you want.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The FreeBSD web site maintains an up-to-date searchable list of
	  all the available applications, at
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/">http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/</ulink>.
	  The name space is divided in to categories, and you may either
	  search for an application by name (if you know it), or you can list
	  all the applications available in a category.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Dan Langille maintains FreshPorts, at
	  <ulink url="http://www.freshports.org/">http://www.freshports.org/</ulink>.
	  FreshPorts tracks changes to the applications in the ports tree as
	  they happen, and allows you to <quote>watch</quote> one or more
	  ports, and will send you an e-mail when they are updated.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you do not know the name of the application you want, try
	  using a site like FreshMeat
	  (<ulink url="http://www.freshmeat.net/">http://www.freshmeat.net/</ulink>)
	  or AppWatch
	  (<ulink url="http://www.appwatch.com/">http://www.appwatch.com/</ulink>)
	  to find an application, then check back at the FreeBSD site to see
	  if the application has been ported yet.</para>

    <title>Using the Ports Collection</title>

    <para>The following sections provide basic instructions on using the
      ports collection to install or remove programs from your
      system.</para>

    <sect2 id="ports-skeleton">
      <title>Installing Ports</title>

      <para>The first thing that should be explained
        when it comes to the Ports collection is what is actually meant
	by a <quote>skeleton</quote>.  In a nutshell, a port skeleton is a
	minimal set of files that are needed for a program to compile and
	install cleanly on FreeBSD.  Each port skeleton includes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>Makefile</filename>.  The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> contains various statements that
	    specify how the application should be compiled and where it
	    should be installed on your system</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>distinfo</filename> file.  This file contains
	    information about the files that must be downloaded to build the
	    port, and checksums, to ensure that that files have not been
	    corrupted during the download.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>files</filename> directory.  This directory
	    contains patches to make the program compile and install on
	    your FreeBSD system.  Patches are basically small files that
	    specify changes to particular files.  They are in plain text
	    format, and basically say <quote>Remove line 10</quote> or
	    <quote>Change line 26 to this ...</quote>.  Patches are also
	    known as <quote>diffs</quote> because they are generated by the
	    <application>diff</application> program.</para>

	  <para>This directory may also contain other files used in building
	    the port.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>pkg-comment</filename> file.  This is a one-line
	    description of the program.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>pkg-descr</filename> file.  This is a more
	    detailed, often multiple-line, description of the program.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file.  This is a list of all
	    the files that will be installed by the port.  It also tells the
	    ports system what files to remove upon deinstallation.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Now that you have enough background information to know what
        the Ports collection is used for, you are ready to install your
	first port.  There are two ways this can be done, and each is
	explained below.</para>

      <para>Before we get into that however, you will need to choose a
        port to install.  There are a few ways to do this, with the
	easiest method being the <ulink
	url="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">ports listing on the FreeBSD
	web site</ulink>.  You can browse through the ports listed there
	or use the search function on the site.  Each port also includes
	a description so you can read a bit about each port before
	deciding to install it.</para>

      <para>Another method is to use the <command>whereis</command>
        command.  To use <command>whereis</command>, simply type
	<quote><command>whereis &lt;program you want to
	install&gt;</command></quote> at the prompt, and if it is found on
        your system, you will be told where it is, like so:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>whereis xchat</userinput>
xchat: /usr/ports/irc/xchat
&prompt.root;</screen>

      <para>This tells us that xchat (an irc client) can be found in the
        <filename>/usr/ports/irc/xchat</filename> directory.</para>

      <para>Yet another way of finding a particular port is by using the
        Ports collection's built-in search mechanism.  To use the search
        feature, you will need to be in the
	<filename>/usr/ports</filename> directory.  Once in that
	directory, run <command>make search key=program-name</command>
	where <quote>program-name</quote> is the name of the program you
	want to find.  For example, if you were looking for xchat:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make search key=xchat</userinput>
Port:   xchat-1.3.8
Path:   /usr/ports/irc/xchat
Info:   An X11 IRC client using the GTK+ toolkit, and optionally, GNOME
Maint:  jim@FreeBSD.org
Index:  irc
B-deps: XFree86-3.3.5 bzip2-0.9.5d gettext-0.10.35 giflib-4.1.0 glib-1.2.6 gmake-3.77 gtk-1.2.6
		imlib-1.9.8 jpeg-6b png-1.0.3 tiff-3.5.1
R-deps: XFree86-3.3.5 gettext-0.10.35 giflib-4.1.0 glib-1.2.6 gtk-1.2.6 imlib-1.9.8 jpeg-6b
		png-1.0.3 tiff-3.5.1</screen>

      <para>The part of the output you want to pay particular attention
        to is the <quote>Path:</quote> line, since that tells you where to
	find it.  The other information provided is not needed in order
	to install the port directly, so it will not be covered
	here.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You must be the <username>root</username> user to install
          ports.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Now that you have found a port you would like to install, you
        are ready to do the actual installation.</para>

      <sect3 id="ports-cd">
        <title>Installing ports from a CDROM</title>

        <para>As you may have guessed from the title, everything
	  described in this section assumes you have a FreeBSD CDROM set.
	  If you do not, you can order one from the <ulink
	  url="http://www.freebsdmall.com/">FreeBSD Mall</ulink>.</para>

        <para>Assuming that your FreeBSD CDROM is in the drive and is
	  mounted on <filename>/cdrom</filename> (and the mount point
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> be <filename>/cdrom</filename>),
	  you are ready to install the port.  To begin, change directories
	  to the directory where the port you want to install lives:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/irc/xchat</userinput></screen>

        <para>Once inside the xchat directory, you will see the port
	  skeleton.  The next step is to compile (also called build) the
	  port.  This is done by simply typing <command>make</command> at
	  the prompt.  Once you have done so, you should see something
	  like this:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>

        <note>
          <para>Please be aware that the licenses of a few ports do not
            allow for inclusion on the CDROM.  This could be for various
	    reasons, including things such as as registration form needs
	    to be filled out before downloading, if redistribution is not
	    allowed, and so on.  If you wish to install a port not
	    included on the CDROM, you will need to be online in order to

      <title>Removing Installed Ports</title>

      <para>Now that you know how to install ports, you are probably
        wondering how to remove them, just in case you install one and
	later on you decide that you installed the wrong port.  The next
	few paragraphs will cover just that.</para>

      <para>Now we will remove our previous example (which was xchat for
        those of you not paying attention).  As with installing ports,
	the first thing you must do is change to the port directory,
	which if you remember was
	<filename>/usr/ports/irc/xchat</filename>.  After you change
	directories, you are ready to uninstall xchat.  This is done with
	the <command>make deinstall</command> command (makes sense
	right?):</para>

	  <para id="ports-patch">What is a patch?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>A patch is a small file that specifies how to go from
	    one version of a file to another.  It contains plain text,
	    and basically says things like <quote>delete line 23</quote>,
	    <quote>add these two lines after line 468</quote>, or
	    <quote>change line 197 to this</quote>.  They are also known
	    as diffs because they are generated by the
	    <application>diff</application> program.</para>

	  <question>
	  <para id="ports-tarball">What is all this about
	    tarballs?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>It is a file ending in <filename>.tar</filename>, or
	    with variations such as <filename>.tar.gz</filename>,
	    <filename>.tar.Z</filename>, <filename>.tar.bz2</filename>,
	    and even <filename>.tgz</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Basically, it is a directory tree that has been archived
	    into a single file (<filename>.tar</filename>) and
	    optionally compressed (<filename>.gz</filename>).  This
	    technique was originally used for <emphasis>T</emphasis>ape
	    <emphasis>AR</emphasis>chives (hence the name
	    <command>tar</command>), but it is a widely used way of
	    distributing program source code around the Internet.</para>

	  <para>You can see what files are in them, or even extract them
	    yourself by using the standard UNIX tar program, which comes
	    with the base FreeBSD system, like this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>tar tvzf foobar.tar.gz</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>tar xzvf foobar.tar.gz</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>tar tvf foobar.tar</userinput>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	  <para id="ports-checksum">And a checksum?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>It is a number generated by adding up all the data in
	    the file you want to check.  If any of the characters
	    change, the checksum will no longer be equal to the total,
	    so a simple comparison will allow you to spot the
	    difference.</para>

	  <question>
	  <para>I did what you said for compiling ports from a CDROM and
	    it worked great until I tried to install the kermit
	    port.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
&gt;&gt; cku190.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist on this system.
&gt;&gt; Attempting to fetch from ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/archives/.</screen>

	  <para>Why can it not be found?  Have I got a dud CDROM?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>As was explained in the <link
	    linkend="ports-cd">compiling ports from CDROM</link>
	    section, some ports cannot be put on the CDROM set
	    due to licensing restrictions.  Kermit is an example of
	    that.  The licensing terms for kermit do not allow us to put
	    the tarball for it on the CDROM, so you will have to fetch
	    it by hand&mdash;sorry!</para>

	  <para>The reason why you got all those error messages was
	    because you were not connected to the Internet at the time.
	    Once you have downloaded it from any of the MASTER_SITES
	    (listed in the Makefile), you can restart the install
	    process.</para>

	  <question>
	  <para>I did that, but when I tried to put it into
	    <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename> I got some error
	    about not having permission.</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>The ports mechanism looks for the tarball in
	    <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>, but you will not
	    be able to copy anything there because it is symlinked to
	    the CDROM, which is read-only.  You can tell it to look
	    somewhere else by doing:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make DISTDIR=<replaceable>/where/you/put/it</replaceable> install</userinput></screen>

	  <question>
	  <para>Does the ports scheme only work if you have everything
	    in <filename>/usr/ports</filename>?  My system administrator
	    says I must put everything under
	    <filename>/u/people/guests/wurzburger</filename>, but it
	    does not seem to work.</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>You can use the <makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar> and
	    <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> variables to tell the ports
	    mechanism to use different directories.  For
	    instance,</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make PORTSDIR=/u/people/guests/wurzburger/ports install</userinput></screen>

	  <para>will compile the port in
	    <filename>/u/people/guests/wurzburger/ports</filename> and
	    install everything under
	    <filename>/usr/local</filename>.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make PREFIX=/u/people/guests/wurzburger/local install</userinput></screen>

	  <para>will compile it in <filename>/usr/ports</filename> and
	    install it in
	    <filename>/u/people/guests/wurzburger/local</filename>.</para>

	  <para>And of course,</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make PORTSDIR=../ports PREFIX=../local install</userinput></screen>

	  <para>will combine the two (it is too long to write fully on
	    the page, but it should give you the general idea).</para>

	  <para>Some ports that use &man.imake.1; (a part of the X Windows
	  System) don't work well with <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, and will insist on
	  installing under <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>.  Similarly, some Perl ports
	  ignore <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> and install in the Perl tree.  Making these
	  ports respect <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> is a difficult or impossible
	  job.</para>

	  <para>If you do not fancy typing all that in every time you
	    install a port, it is a good idea to put these variables
	    into your environment.  Read the man page for your shell for
	    instructions on doing so.</para>

	  <para>I do not have a FreeBSD CDROM, but I would like to have

	  <answer>
	  <para>Yes.  If you know, for example, that <hostid

	  <question>
	  <para>I have heard that some compiler options can cause bugs.
	    Is this true?  How can I make sure that I compile ports
	    with the right settings?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	  <para>Yes, with version 2.6.3 of <command>gcc</command> (the
	    version shipped with FreeBSD 2.1.0 and 2.1.5), the
	    <option>-O2</option> option could result in buggy code
	    unless you used the <option>-fno-strength-reduce</option>
	    option as well.  (Most of the ports do not use
	    <option>-O2</option>).  You <emphasis>should</emphasis> be
	    able to specify the compiler options used by something
	    like:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make CFLAGS='-O2 -fno-strength-reduce' install</userinput></screen>

	  <para>or by editing <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>, but
	    unfortunately not all ports respect this.  The surest way
	    is to do <command>make configure</command>, then go into
	    the source directory and inspect the Makefiles by hand, but
	    this can get tedious if the source has lots of
	    sub-directories, each with their own Makefiles.</para>

	    <para>The default FreeBSD compiler options are quite conservative, 
	      so if you have not changed them you should not have any
	      problems.</para>

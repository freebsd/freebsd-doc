  <title>Electronic Mail</title>
  
  <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.wlloyd;.</emphasis></para>
  
  <para>Electronic Mail configuration is the subject of many <link
      linkend="bibliography">System Administration</link> books. If you plan
    on doing anything beyond setting up one mailhost for your network, you
    need industrial strength help.</para>
  
  <para>Some parts of E-Mail configuration are controlled in the Domain Name
    System (DNS). If you are going to run your own own DNS server check out
    <filename>/etc/namedb</filename> and <command>man -k named</command> for
    more information.</para>
      
  <sect1>
    <title>Basic Information</title>
    
    <para>These are the major programs involved in an E-Mail exchange. A
      &ldquo;mailhost&rdquo; is a server that is responsible for delivering
      and receiving all email for your host, and possibly your network.</para>
	
    <sect2>
      <title>User program</title>
      
      <para>This is a program like <application >elm</application>,
	<application>pine</application>, <application>mail</application>, or
	something more sophisticated like a WWW browser. This program will
	simply pass off all e-mail transactions to the local
	&ldquo;mailhost&rdquo; , either by calling <command>sendmail</command>
	or delivering it over TCP.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Mailhost Server Daemon</title>
      
      <para>Usually this program is <command>sendmail</command> or
	<command>smail</command> running in the background. Turn it off or
	change the command line options in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	(or, prior to FreeBSD 2.2.2, <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>). It
	is best to leave it on, unless you have a specific reason to want it
	off. Example: You are building a <link
	  linkend="firewalls">Firewall</link>.</para>
	  
      <para>You should be aware that <command>sendmail</command> is a
	potential weak link in a secure site. Some versions of
	<command>sendmail</command> have known security problems.</para>
      
      <para><command>sendmail</command> does two jobs. It looks after
	delivering and receiving mail.</para>
      
      <para>If <command>sendmail</command> needs to deliver mail off your site
	it will look up in the DNS to determine the actual host that will
	receive mail for the destination.</para>
	  
      <para>If it is acting as a delivery agent <command>sendmail</command>
	will take the message from the local queue and deliver it across the
	Internet to another sendmail on the receivers computer.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>DNS &mdash; Name Service</title>
      
      <para>The Domain Name System and its daemon <command>named</command>,
	contain the database mapping hostname to IP address, and hostname to
	mailhost. The IP address is specified in an A record. The MX record
	specifies the mailhost that will receive mail for you. If you do not
	have a MX record mail for your hostname, the mail will be delivered to
	your host directly.</para>
	  
      <para>Unless you are running your own DNS server, you will not be able
	to change any information in the DNS yourself. If you are using an
	Internet Provider, speak to them.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>POP Servers</title>
      
      <para>This program gets the mail from your mailbox and gives it to your
	browser. If you want to run a POP server on your computer, you will
	need to do 2 things.</para>
	  
      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Get pop software from the <ulink
	      URL="../ports/mail.html">Ports collection</ulink>  that can be
	    found in <filename>/usr/ports</filename> or packages collection.
	    This handbook section has a complete reference on the <link
	      linkend="ports">Ports</link> system.</para>
	</step>
	
	<step>
	  <para>Modify <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> to load the POP
	    server.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>
      
      <para>The pop program will have instructions with it. Read them.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Basic</title>
      
      <para>As your FreeBSD system comes &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;[TM], you
	should be able to send E-mail to external hosts as long as you have
	<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> setup or are running a name
	server. If you want to have mail for your host delivered to your
	specific host,there are two methods:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Run a name server (<command>man -k named</command>) and have
	    your own domain <hostid role="domainname">smallminingco.com
	    </hostid></para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>Get mail delivered to the current DNS name for your host. Ie:
	    <hostid role="fqdn">dorm6.ahouse.school.edu </hostid></para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>No matter what option you choose, to have mail delivered directly
	to your host, you must be a full Internet host. You must have a
	permanent IP address. IE: NO dynamic PPP. If you are behind a
	firewall, the firewall must be passing on smtp traffic to you. From
	<filename>/etc/services</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>
smtp	      25/tcp mail         #Simple Mail Transfer</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to receive mail at your host itself, you must make
	sure that the DNS MX entry points to your host address, or there is no
	MX entry for your DNS name.</para>
      
      <para>Try this:</para>
      
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hostname</userinput>
newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org
&prompt.root; <userinput>host newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org</userinput>
newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org has address 204.216.27.xx</screen>
	    
      <para>If that is all that comes out for your machine, mail directory to
	<email>root@newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org</email> will work no
	problems.</para>
      
      <para>If instead, you have this:</para>
      
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>host newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org</userinput>
newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org has address 204.216.27.xx
newbsdbox.FreeBSD.org mail is handled (pri=10) by freefall.FreeBSD.org</screen>
	    
      <para>All mail sent to your host directly will end up on
	<hostid>freefall</hostid>, under the same username.</para>
      
      <para>This information is setup in your domain name server. This should
	be the same host that is listed as your primary nameserver in
	<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename></para>
      
      <para>The DNS record that carries mail routing information is the Mail
	eXchange entry. If no MX entry exists, mail will be delivered directly
	to the host by way of the Address record.</para>
	  
      <para>The MX entry for <hostid role="fqdn">freefall.FreeBSD.org</hostid>
	at one time.</para>
      
      <programlisting>
freefall                       MX    30   mail.crl.net
freefall                       MX    40   agora.rdrop.com

freefall                       CNAME www.FreeBSD.org</programlisting>
	  
      <para><hostid>freefall</hostid> has many MX entries. The lowest MX
	number gets the mail in the end. The others will queue mail
	temporarily, if <hostid>freefall</hostid> is busy or down.</para>
	  
      <para>Alternate MX sites should have separate connections to the
	Internet, to be most useful. An Internet Provider or other friendly
	site can provide this service.</para>
	  
      <para><command>dig</command>, <command>nslookup</command>, and
	<command>host</command> are your friends.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="mail-domain">
      <title>Mail for your Domain (Network).</title>
      
      <para>To setup up a network mailhost, you need to direct the mail from
	arriving at all the workstations. In other words, you want to hijack
	all mail for <hostid role="domainname">*.smallminingco.com </hostid>
	and divert it to one machine, your &ldquo;mailhost&rdquo;.</para>
	  
      <para>The network users on their workstations will most likely pick up
	their mail over POP or telnet.</para>
	  
      <para>A user account with the <emphasis>same username</emphasis> should
	exist on both machines. Please use <command>adduser</command> to do
	this as required. If you set the <literal>shell</literal> to
	<literal>/nonexistent</literal> the user will not be allowed to
	login.</para>
	  
      <para>The mailhost that you will be using must be designated the
	Mail eXchange for each workstation. This must be arranged in DNS (ie
	BIND, named). Please refer to a Networking book for in-depth
	information.</para>
	  
      <para>You basically need to add these lines in your DNS server.</para>

      <programlisting>
pc24.smallminingco.com	A <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable>		; Workstation ip
                       MX  10 smtp.smallminingco.com	; Your mailhost</programlisting>
	  
      <para>You cannot do this yourself unless you are running a DNS server.
	If you do not want to run a DNS server, get somebody else like your
	Internet Provider to do it.</para>
	  
      <para>This will redirect mail for the workstation to the Mail eXchange
	host. It does not matter what machine the A record points to, the mail
	will be sent to the MX host.</para>
	  
      <para>This feature is used to implement Virtual E-Mail Hosting.</para>
      
      <para>Example</para>
      
      <para>I have a customer with domain foo.bar and I want all mail for
	foo.bar to be sent to my machine smtp.smalliap.com. You must make an
	entry in your DNS server like:</para>

      <programlisting>
foo.bar                  MX  10	smtp.smalliap.com	; your mailhost</programlisting>

      <para>The A record is not needed if you only want E-Mail for the domain.
	IE: Don't expect <command>ping foo.bar</command> to work unless an
	Address record for <filename>foo.bar</filename> exists as well.</para>
	  
      <para>On the mailhost that actually accepts mail for final delivery to a
	mailbox, <command>sendmail</command> must be told what hosts it will
	be accepting mail for.</para>
	  
      <para>Add <literal>pc24.smallminingco.com</literal> to
	<filename>/etc/sendmail.cw</filename> (if you are using
	<literal>FEATURE(use_cw_file)</literal>), or add a <literal>Cw
	  myhost.smalliap.com</literal> line to
	<filename>/etc/sendmail.cf</filename></para>
	  
      <para>If you plan on doing anything serious with
	<command>sendmail</command> you should install the
	<command>sendmail</command> source. The source has plenty of
	documentation with it. You will find information on getting
	<command>sendmail</command> source from <link
	  linkend="sendmailuucp">the UUCP information</link>.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="sendmailuucp">
      <title>Setting up UUCP.</title>
      
      <para><emphasis>Stolen from the FAQ.</emphasis></para>
      
      <para>The sendmail configuration that ships with FreeBSD is suited for
	sites that connect directly to the Internet. Sites that wish to
	exchange their mail via UUCP must install another
	<command>sendmail</command> configuration file.</para>
	  
      <para>Tweaking <filename>/etc/sendmail.cf</filename> manually is
	considered something for purists. Sendmail version 8 comes with a new
	approach of generating config files via some <command>m4</command>
	preprocessing, where the actual hand-crafted configuration is on a
	higher abstraction level. You should use the configuration files under
	<filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf</filename>.</para>
	  
      <para>If you did not install your system with full sources, the
	<command>sendmail</command> config stuff has been broken out into a
	separate source distribution tarball just for you. Assuming you have
	your CD-ROM mounted, do:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar -xvzf /cdrom/dists/src/ssmailcf.aa</userinput></screen>
	  
      <para>Do not panic, this is only a few hundred kilobytes in size. The
	file <filename>README</filename> in the <filename>cf</filename>
	directory can serve as a basic introduction to m4
	configuration.</para>
	  
      <para>For UUCP delivery, you are best advised to use the
	<emphasis>mailertable</emphasis> feature. This constitutes a database
	that <command>sendmail</command> can use to base its routing decision
	upon.</para>
	  
      <para>First, you have to create your <filename>.mc</filename> file. The
	directory <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</filename> is the
	home of these files. Look around, there are already a few examples.
	Assuming you have named your file <filename>foo.mc</filename>, all you
	need to do in order to convert it into a valid
	<filename>sendmail.cf</filename> is:</para>
      
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make foo.cf</userinput></screen>
	  
      <para>If you don't have a <filename>/usr/obj</filename> hierarchy,
	then:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf</userinput></screen>
	  
      <para>Otherwise:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp /usr/obj/`pwd`/foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf</userinput></screen>
	  
      <para>A typical <filename>.mc</filename> file might look like:</para>
	  
      <programlisting>
include(`../m4/cf.m4')
VERSIONID(`<replaceable>Your version number</replaceable>')
OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

FEATURE(nodns)
FEATURE(nocanonify)
FEATURE(mailertable)

define(`UUCP_RELAY', <replaceable>your.uucp.relay</replaceable>)
define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)

MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
MAILER(uucp)

Cw    <replaceable>your.alias.host.name</replaceable>
Cw    <replaceable>youruucpnodename.UUCP</replaceable></programlisting>
	  
      <para>The <literal>nodns</literal> and <literal>nocanonify</literal>
	features will prevent any usage of the DNS during mail delivery. The
	<literal>UUCP_RELAY</literal> clause is needed for bizarre reasons, do
	not ask. Simply put an Internet hostname there that is able to handle
	.UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely, you will enter the mail
	relay of your ISP there.</para>
	  
      <para>Once you have this, you need this file called
	<filename>/etc/mailertable</filename>. A typical example of this
	gender again:</para>
      
      <programlisting>
#
# makemap hash /etc/mailertable.db &lt; /etc/mailertable
#
horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
.interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
.heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1 horus.UUCP
uucp-dom:horus                if-bus.UUCP
uucp-dom:if-bus .	      uucp-dom:sax</programlisting>
	  
      <para>As you can see, this is part of a real-life file. The first three
	lines handle special cases where domain-addressed mail should not be
	sent out to the default route, but instead to some UUCP neighbor in
	order to &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; the delivery path. The next line
	handles mail to the local Ethernet domain that can be delivered using
	SMTP. Finally, the UUCP neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP
	pseudo-domain notation, to allow for a
	<literal>uucp-neighbor!recipient</literal> override of the default
	rules. The last line is always a single dot, matching everything else,
	with UUCP delivery to a UUCP neighbor that serves as your universal
	mail gateway to the world. All of the node names behind the
	<literal>uucp-dom:</literal> keyword must be valid UUCP neighbors, as
	you can verify using the command <command>uuname</command>.</para>
	  
      <para>As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a DBM
	database file before being usable, the command line to accomplish this
	is best placed as a comment at the top of the
	<filename>mailertable</filename>. You always have to execute this
	command each time you change your
	<filename>mailertable</filename>.</para>
	  
      <para>Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular mail
	routing would work, remember the <option>-bt</option> option to
	<command>sendmail</command>. It starts <command>sendmail</command> in
	&ldquo;address test mode&rdquo;; simply enter <literal>0</literal>,
	followed by the address you wish to test for the mail routing. The
	last line tells you the used internal mail agent, the destination host
	this agent will be called with, and the (possibly translated) address.
	Leave this mode by typing Control-D.</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>sendmail -bt</userinput>
ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;
<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <userinput>0 foo@interface-business.de</userinput>
rewrite: ruleset  0   input: foo @ interface-business . de

      <title>Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?</title>
      
      <para>You will probably find that the host is actually in a different

	  role="fqdn">foo.bar.edu</hostid> and you wish to reach a host called
	<hostid>mumble</hostid> in the <hostid
	  role="domainname">bar.edu</hostid> domain, you will have to refer to
	it by the fully-qualified domain name, <hostid
	  role="fqdn">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>, instead of just
	<hostid>mumble</hostid>.</para>
	  
      <para>Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers. However the
	current version of <application>BIND</application> that ships with
	FreeBSD no longer provides default abbreviations for non-fully

	unqualified host <hostid>mumble</hostid> must either be found as
	<hostid role="fqdn">mumble.foo.bar.edu</hostid>, or it will be
	searched for in the root domain.</para>
	  
      <para>This is different from the previous behavior, where the search
	continued across <hostid role="domainname">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>,

How can I solve this problem?

You have asked mail to the domain (e.g., domain.net) to be
forwarded to a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net)
by using an MX record, but the relay machine does not recognize
itself as domain.net. Add domain.net to /etc/sendmail.cw
(if you are using FEATURE(use_cw_file)) or add "Cw domain.net"
to /etc/sendmail.cf.</programlisting>

      <title>How can I do E-Mail with a dialup PPP host?</title>
      
      <para>You want to connect a FreeBSD box on a lan, to the Internet. The
	FreeBSD box will be a mail gateway for the lan. The PPP connection is
	non-dedicated.</para>
	  
      <para>There are at least two way to do this.</para>
      
      <para>The other is to use UUCP.</para>
      
      <para>The key is to get a Internet site to provide secondary MX services
	for your domain. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>
bigco.com.	      MX	10	bigco.com.
                      MX        20      smalliap.com.</programlisting>
	  
      <para>Only one host should be specified as the final recipient ( add
	<literal>Cw bigco.com</literal> in
	<filename>/etc/sendmail.cf</filename> on bigco.com).</para>
	  
      <para>When the senders <command>sendmail</command> is trying to deliver
	the mail it will try to connect to you over the modem link. It will
	most likely time out because you are not online.
	<command>sendmail</command> will automatically deliver it to the
	secondary MX site, ie your Internet provider. The secondary MX site
	will try every (<literal>sendmail_flags = "-bd -q15m"</literal> in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> ) 15 minutes to connect to your host
	to deliver the mail to the primary MX site.</para>
	  
      <para>You might want to use something like this as a login
	script.</para>

      <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
# Put me in /usr/local/bin/pppbigco
( sleep 60 ; /usr/sbin/sendmail -q ) &amp;
/usr/sbin/ppp -direct pppbigco</programlisting>

      <para>If you are going to create a separate login script for a user you
	could use <command>sendmail -qRbigco.com</command> instead in the
	script above. This will force all mail in your queue for bigco.com to
	be processed immediately.</para>
	  
      <para>A further refinement of the situation is as follows.</para>
      
      <para>Message stolen from the freebsd-isp mailing list.</para>

      <programlisting>
&gt; we provide the secondary mx for a customer. The customer connects to
&gt; our services several times a day automatically to get the mails to
&gt; his primary mx (We do not call his site when a mail for his domains
&gt; arrived). Our sendmail sends the mailqueue every 30 minutes. At the
&gt; moment he has to stay 30 minutes online to be sure that all mail is
&gt; gone to the primary mx.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a command that would initiate sendmail to send all the mails
&gt; now? The user has not root-privileges on our machine of course.

In the 'privacy flags' section of sendmail.cf, there is a definition
Opgoaway,restrictqrun

Remove restrictqrun to allow non-root users to start the queue processing.
You might also like to rearrange the MXs. We are the 1st MX for our
customers like this, and we have defined:

# If we are the best MX for a host, try directly instead of generating
# local config error.
OwTrue

That way a remote site will deliver straight to you, without trying
the customer connection. You then send to your customer. Only works for
"hosts", so you need to get your customer to name their mail machine
"customer.com" as well as "hostname.customer.com" in the DNS. Just put
an A record in the DNS for "customer.com".</programlisting>

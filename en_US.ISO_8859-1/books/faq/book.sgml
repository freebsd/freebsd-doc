    <para>Welcome to the FreeBSD 2.X-4.X FAQ!</para>

    <para>As is usual with Usenet FAQs, this document aims to cover the
      most frequently asked questions concerning the FreeBSD operating
      system (and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended
      to reduce bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked
      over and over again, FAQs have become recognized as valuable
      information resources.</para>

    <para>Every effort has been made to make this FAQ as informative as
      possible; if you have any suggestions as to how it may be improved,
      please feel free to mail them to the &a.faq;.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What is FreeBSD?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
         <para>Briefly, FreeBSD is a UN*X-like operating system for the
           i386 and Alpha/AXP platforms based on U.C. Berkeley's
           4.4BSD-Lite release.
           It is also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C.
           Berkeley's Net/2 to the i386, known as 386BSD, though very
           little of the 386BSD code remains.  A fuller description of
           what FreeBSD is and how it can work for you may be found on
           the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD home
           page</ulink>.</para>

         <para>FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers,
           researchers, computer professionals, students and home users
           all over the world in their work, education and recreation.

        <question>
          <para>What are the goals of FreeBSD?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software
            that may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.
            Many of us have a significant investment in the code (and
            project) and would certainly not mind a little financial
            compensation now and then, but we're definitely not prepared
            to insist on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
            <quote>mission</quote> is to provide code to any and all
            comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the
            widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
            This is, we believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
            Software and one that we enthusiastically support.</para>

          <para>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU
            General Public License (GPL) or GNU Library General Public
            License (LGPL) comes with slightly more strings attached,
            though at least on the side of enforced access rather than the
            usual opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that can
            evolve in the commercial use of GPL software, we do, however,
            endeavor to replace such software with submissions under the
            more relaxed BSD copyright whenever possible.</para>

                users.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Full source for the operating system is freely
                available, and the minimum possible restrictions have
                been placed upon its use, distribution and incorporation
                into other work (commercial or non-commercial).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Anyone who has an improvement and/or bug fix is free
                to submit their code and have it added to the source tree
                (subject to one or two obvious provisos).</para>

          </itemizedlist>

          <para>For those of our readers whose first language is not
            English, it may be worth pointing out that the word
            <quote>free</quote> is being used in two ways here, one meaning
            <quote>at no cost</quote>, the other meaning <quote>you can do
            whatever you like</quote>.  Apart from one or two things you
            <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> do with the FreeBSD code, for
            example pretending you wrote it, you really can do whatever you
            like with it.</para>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>What is the latest version of FreeBSD?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Version <ulink
            URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE/">4.1.1</ulink>
            is the latest <emphasis>STABLE</emphasis> version; it was
            released in September, 2000. This is also the latest
            <emphasis>RELEASE</emphasis> version.</para>

          <para>Briefly explained, <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> is aimed
            at the ISP or other corporate user who wants stability and a
            low change count over the wizzy new features of the latest
            <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot.  Releases can come
            from either branch, but you should only use
            <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> if you're sure that you're
            prepared for its increased volatility (relative to
            <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>, that is).</para>

          <para>Releases are only made <link linkend="release-freq">every
            few months</link>. While many people stay more up-to-date with
            the FreeBSD sources (see the questions on <link
            linkend="current">FreeBSD-CURRENT</link> and <link
            linkend="stable">FreeBSD-STABLE</link>) than that, doing so
            is more of a commitment, as the sources are a moving
            target.</para>

      <qandaentry>
        <question id="current">

        <answer>
          <para><ulink
            URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">FreeBSD-CURRENT</ulink>
            is the development version of the operating system, which will
            in due course become 5.0-RELEASE.  As such, it is really only
            of interest to developers working on the system and die-hard
            hobbyists.  See the <ulink
            URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">relevant
            section</ulink> in the <ulink
            URL="../handbook/index.html">handbook</ulink> for details on
            running -CURRENT.</para>

          <para>If you are not familiar with the operating system or are
            not capable of identifying the difference between a real
            problem and a temporary problem, you should not use
            FreeBSD-CURRENT.  This branch sometimes evolves quite quickly
            and can be un-buildable for a number of days at a time.
            People that use FreeBSD-CURRENT are expected to be able to
            analyze any problems and only report them if they are deemed
            to be mistakes rather than <quote>glitches</quote>. Questions
            such as <quote>make world produces some error about
            groups</quote> on the -CURRENT mailing list are sometimes
            treated with contempt.</para>

            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/snapshots.html">snapshot
            </ulink> releases are made based on the current state of the
            -CURRENT and -STABLE branches. Nowadays, distributions of the
            occasional snapshot are now being made available. The goals
            behind each snapshot release are:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>To give people who would like to run -CURRENT or
                -STABLE but who don't have the time and/or bandwidth to
                follow it on a day-to-day basis an easy way of
                bootstrapping it onto their systems.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code in
                question, just in case we break something really badly
                later.  (Although CVS normally prevents anything horrible
                like this happening :)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>To ensure that any new features in need of testing

          </itemizedlist>

          <para>No claims are made that any -CURRENT snapshot can be
            considered <quote>production quality</quote> for any purpose.
            If you want to run a stable and fully tested system, you will
            have to stick to full releases, or use the -STABLE
            snaphosts.</para>

        <question id="stable">
          <para>What is the FreeBSD-STABLE concept?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Back when FreeBSD 2.0.5 was released, we decided to
            branch FreeBSD development into two parts.  One branch was
            named <ulink URL="../handbook/stable.html">-STABLE</ulink>,
            with the intention that only well-tested bug fixes and small
            incremental enhancements would be made to it (for Internet
            Service Providers and other commercial enterprises for whom
            sudden shifts or experimental features are quite
            undesirable).  The other branch was <ulink
            URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">-CURRENT</ulink>,
            which essentially has been one unbroken line leading towards
            5.0-RELEASE (and beyond) since 2.0 was released. If a little
            ASCII art would help, this is how it looks:</para>

          <para>The -CURRENT branch is slowly progressing towards 5.0 and
            beyond, the previous 2.2-STABLE branch having been retired with
            the release of 2.2.8. 3-STABLE replaced it, with 3.5.1 (the
            final 3.X release) being released in July 2000. In May 2000
            (even though 3.5 came after that), the 3-STABLE branch was more
            or less replaced by the 4-STABLE branch. 4.1.1-RELEASE was
            released in September 2000. 4-STABLE is the actively developed
            -STABLE branch, although some bugfixes (mostly
            security-related) are still being committed to 3-STABLE. It is
            expected that the 3.X branch will be officially obsoleted some
            time in summer 2000. 5.0-CURRENT is now the <quote>current

        <answer>
          <para>As a general principle, the FreeBSD core team only release
            a new version of FreeBSD when they believe that there are
            sufficient new features and/or bug fixes to justify one, and
            are satisfied that the changes made have settled down
            sufficiently to avoid compromising the stability of the
            release.  Many users regard this caution as one of the best
            things about FreeBSD, although it can be a little frustrating

                the pain of reading man pages or doing your own research.
                It is a chat channel, first and foremost, and topics there

          <para>After choosing the format and compression mechanism that you

            download the document as a FreeBSD
            <emphasis>package</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>The advantage of downloading and installing the package is
            that the documentation can then be managed using the normal
            FreeBSD package management comments, such as &man.pkg.add.1; and
            &man.pkg.delete.1;.</para>

          <para>If you decide to download and install the package then you
            must know the filename to download.  The documentation-as-packages 
            files are stored in a directory called
            <filename>packages</filename>.  Each package file looks like
            <filename><replaceable>document-name</replaceable>.<replaceable>lang</replaceable>.<replaceable>encoding</replaceable>.<replaceable>format</replaceable>.tgz</filename>.</para>

          <para>For example, the FAQ, in English, formatted as PDF, is in the
            package called
            <filename>faq.en_US.ISO_8859-1.pdf.tgz</filename>.</para>

          <para>Knowing this, you can use the following command to install the 
            English PDF FAQ package.</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/packages/faq.en_US.ISO_8859-1.pdf.tgz</userinput></screen>
          
          <para>Having done that, you can use &man.pkg.info.1; to determine
            where the file has been installed.</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_info -f faq.en_US.ISO_8859-1.pdf</userinput>

        Package name: faq.en_US.ISO_8859-1.pdf

File: book.pdf
        CWD to .
File: +COMMENT (ignored)
File: +DESC (ignored)</screen>

          <para>As you can see, <filename>book.pdf</filename> will have been
            installed in to
            <filename>/usr/share/doc/en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/faq</filename>.
          </para>

          <para>If you do not want to use the packages then you will have to
            download the compressed files yourself, uncompress them, and then
            copy the appropriate documents in to place.</para>

          <para>For example, the split HTML version of the FAQ, compressed
            using &man.gzip.1;, can be found in the
            <filename>en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/faq/book.html-split.tar.gz</filename> 
            file.  To download and uncompress that file you would have to do
            this.</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/faq/book.html-split.tar.gz</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>gzip -d book.html-split.tar.gz</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar xvf book.html-split.tar</userinput></screen>

          <para>You will be left with a collection of
            <filename>.html</filename> files.  The main one is called
            <filename>index.html</filename>, which will contain the table of
            contents, introductory material, and links to the other parts of
            the document.  You can then copy or move these to their final
            location as necessary.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Prior to release 3.1, you only needed one floppy image to
            install FreeBSD, namely <filename>floppies/boot.flp</filename>.
            However, since release 3.1 the Project has added base support
            for a wide variety of hardware which needed more space, and
            thus for 3.x and 4.x we now use two floppy images, namely
            <filename>floppies/kernel.flp</filename> and
            <filename>floppies/mfsroot.flp</filename>. These images need to
            be copied onto floppies by tools like
            <command>fdimage</command> or &man.dd.1;.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>A 3.5 inch (1.44MB) floppy can accomodate 1474560 bytes

                corrupt the boot image. Check the size of the downloaded

        <question>
          <para>I have only 4 MB of RAM. Can I install FreeBSD?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>FreeBSD 2.1.7 was the last version of FreeBSD that could
            be installed on a 4MB system.  Newer versions of FreeBSD, like
            2.2, need at least 5MB to install on a new system.</para>

          <para>All versions of FreeBSD, including 3.0, will
            <emphasis>run</emphasis> in 4MB of RAM, they just can't run the
            installation program in 4MB. You can add extra memory for the
            install process, if you like, and then after the system is up
            and running, go back to 4MB. Or you could always just swap your
            disk into a system which has &gt;4MB, install onto it and then
            swap it back.</para>

          <para>There are also situations in which FreeBSD 2.1.7 will not
            install in 4 MB. To be exact: it does not install with 640 kB
            base + 3 MB extended memory. If your motherboard can remap some
            of the <quote>lost</quote> memory out of the 640kB to 1MB
            region, then you may still be able to get FreeBSD 2.1.7
            up.</para>

          <para>Try to go into your BIOS setup and look for a
            <quote>remap</quote> option.  Enable it.  You may also have to
            disable ROM shadowing.</para>

          <para>It may be easier to get 4 more MB just for the install.
            Build a custom kernel with only the options you need and then
            get the 4MB out again.</para>

          <para>You may also install 2.0.5 and then upgrade your system to
            2.1.7 with the <quote>upgrade</quote> option of the 2.1.7
            installation program.</para>

          <para>After the installation, if you build a custom kernel, it
            will run in 4 MB. Someone has even succeeded in booting with 2
            MB (the system was almost unusable though :-))</para>

          <para>Can I install on a disk with bad blocks?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Prior to 3.0, FreeBSD included a utility known as
            <command>bad144</command>, which automatically remapped bad
            blocks. Because modern IDE drives perform this function
            themselves, <command>bad144</command> has been removed from the
            FreeBSD source tree. If you wish to install FreeBSD 3.0 or
            later, we strongly suggest you purchase a newer disk drive. If
            you do not wish to do this, you must run FreeBSD 2.x.</para>
            <para>If you are seeing bad block errors with a modern IDE
            drive, chances are the drive is going to die very soon (the
            drive's internal remapping functions are no longer sufficient
            to fix the bad blocks, which means the disk is heavily
            corrupted); we suggest you by a new hard drive.</para>

          <para>If you're seeing things like the machine grinding to a halt
            or spontaneously rebooting when you try to boot the install

              <para>Did you use a new, freshly-formatted, error-free floppy

                <command>fdimage</command> or <command>rawrite</command> in
                pure DOS mode? These OS's can interfere with programs that
                write directly to hardware, which the disk creation program
                does; even running it inside a DOS shell in the GUI can
                cause this problem.</para>

          </orderedlist>

          <para>There have also been reports of Netscape causing problems

        <question>
          <para>I booted from my ATAPI CD-ROM, but the install program says no 
            CD-ROM is found.  Where did it go?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The usual cause of this problem is a mis-configured CD-ROM
            drive.  Many PCs now ship with the CD-ROM as the slave device on
            the secondary IDE controller, with no master device on that
            controller.  This is illegal according to the ATAPI specification,
            but Windows plays fast and loose with the specification, and the
            BIOS ignores it when booting.  This is why the BIOS was able to
            see the  CD-ROM to boot from it, but why FreeBSD can not see it to
            complete  the install.</para>

          <para>Reconfigure your system so that the CD-ROM is either the
            master device on the IDE controller it is attached to, or make
            sure that it is the slave on an IDE controller that also has a
            master device.</para>

        <question id="geometry">
          <para>Which geometry should I use for a disk drive?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>(By the <quote>geometry</quote> of a disk, we mean the
            number of cylinders, heads and sectors/track on a disk - I'll
            refer to this as C/H/S for convenience. This is how the PC's
            BIOS works out which area on a disk to read/write from).</para>

          <para>This seems to cause a lot of confusion for some reason.
            First of all, the <emphasis>physical</emphasis> geometry of a
            SCSI drive is totally irrelevant, as FreeBSD works in term of
            disk blocks. In fact, there is no such thing as
            <emphasis>the</emphasis> physical geometry, as the sector
            density varies across the disk - what manufacturers claim is
            the <emphasis>quote</emphasis> physical geometry is usually the
            geometry that they've worked out results in the least wasted
            space. For IDE disks, FreeBSD does work in terms of C/H/S, but
            all modern drives will convert this into block references
            internally as well.</para>

          <para>All that matters is the <emphasis>logical</emphasis>
            geometry - the answer that the BIOS gets when it asks
            <quote>what is your geometry?</quote> and then uses to access
            the disk. As FreeBSD uses the BIOS when booting, it's very
            important to get this right. In particular, if you have more
            than one operating system on a disk, they must all agree on the
            geometry, otherwise you will have serious problems
            booting!</para>

          <para>For SCSI disks, the geometry to use depends on whether
           extended translation support is turned on in your controller
            (this is often referred to as <quote>support for DOS disks
            &gt;1GB</quote> or something similar). If it's turned off, then
            use <replaceable>N</replaceable> cylinders, 64 heads and 32
            sectors/track, where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the
            capacity of the disk in MB. For example, a 2GB disk should
            pretend to have 2048 cylinders, 64 heads and 32
            sectors/track.</para>

          <para>If it <emphasis>is</emphasis> turned on (it's often supplied
            this way to get around certain limitations in MSDOS) and the
            disk capacity is more than 1GB, use M cylinders, 63 sectors per
            track (*not* 64), and 255 heads, where 'M' is the disk capacity
            in MB divided by 7.844238 (!). So our example 2GB drive would
            have 261 cylinders, 63 sectors per track and 255 heads.</para>

          <para>If you are not sure about this, or FreeBSD fails to detect
            the geometry correctly during installation, the simplest way
            around this is usually to create a small DOS partition on the
            disk. The correct geometry should then be detected (and you can
            always remove the DOS partition in the partition editor if you
            don't want to keep it, or leave it around for programming
            network cards and the like).</para>

          <para>Alternatively, there is a freely available utility
            distributed with FreeBSD called <filename>pfdisk.exe</filename>
            (located in the <filename>tools</filename> subdirectory on the
            FreeBSD CDROM or on the various FreeBSD ftp sites) which can be
            used to work out what geometry the other operating systems on
            the disk are using. You can then enter this geometry in the
            partition editor.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Any restrictions on how I divide the disk up?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Yes. You must make sure that your root partition is below
            1024
            cylinders so the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.  (Note that
            this is a limitation in the PC's BIOS, not FreeBSD).</para>

          <para>For a SCSI drive, this will normally imply that the root
            partition will be in the first 1024MB (or in the first 4096MB
            if extended translation is turned on - see previous question).
            For IDE, the corresponding figure is 504MB.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What about disk managers? Or, I have a large drive!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>FreeBSD recognizes the Ontrack Disk Manager and makes
            allowances for it. Other disk managers are not supported.</para>

          <para>If you just want to use the disk with FreeBSD you don't
            need a disk manager. Just configure the disk for as much space
            as the BIOS can deal with (usually 504 megabytes), and FreeBSD
            should figure out how much space you really have. If you're
            using an old disk with an MFM controller, you may need to
            explicitly tell FreeBSD how many cylinders to use.</para>

          <para>If you want to use the disk with FreeBSD and another
            operating system, you may be able to do without a disk manager:
            just make sure the the FreeBSD boot partition and the slice for
            the other operating system are in the first 1024 cylinders. If
            you're reasonably careful, a 20 megabyte boot partition should
            be plenty.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>This is another symptom of the problem described in the
            preceding question. Your BIOS geometry and FreeBSD geometry
            settings do not agree! If your controller or BIOS supports
            cylinder translation (often marked as <literal>&gt;1GB drive
            support</literal>), try toggling its setting and reinstalling
            FreeBSD.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Do I need to install the complete sources?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>In general, no.  However, we would strongly recommend that
            you install, at a minimum, the <literal>base</literal> source
            kit, which includes several of the files mentioned here, and
            the <literal>sys</literal> (kernel) source kit, which includes
            sources for the kernel. There is nothing in the system which
            requires the presence of the sources to operate, however,
            except for the kernel-configuration program &man.config.8;.
            With the exception of the kernel sources, our build structure
            is set up so that you can read-only mount the sources from
            elsewhere via NFS and still be able to make new binaries.
            (Because of the kernel-source restriction, we recommend that
            you not mount this on <filename>/usr/src</filename> directly,
            but rather in some other location with appropriate symbolic
            links to duplicate the top-level structure of the source
            tree.)</para>

          <para>Having the sources on-line and knowing how to build a
            system with them will make it much easier for you to upgrade
            to future releases of FreeBSD.</para>

          <para>To actually select a subset of the sources, use the Custom
            menu item when you are in the Distributions menu of the
            system installation tool.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Do I need to build a kernel?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Building a new kernel was originally pretty much a required
            step in a FreeBSD installation, but more recent releases have
            benefited from the introduction of a much friendlier kernel
            configuration tool. When at the FreeBSD boot prompt (boot:),
            use the <option>-c</option> flag and you will be dropped into a
            visual configuration screen which allows you to configure the
            kernel's settings for most common ISA cards.</para>

          <para>It's still recommended that you eventually build a new
            kernel containing just the drivers that you need, just to save a
            bit of RAM, but it's no longer a strict requirement for most
            systems.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Should I use DES passwords, or MD5, and how do I specify 
            which form my users receive?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The default password format on FreeBSD is to use
            <emphasis>MD5</emphasis>-based passwords. These are believed to
            be more secure than the traditional UNIX password format, which
            used a scheme based on the <emphasis>DES</emphasis> algorithm.
            DES passwords are still available if you need to share your
            password file with legacy operating systems which still use the
            less secure password format (they are available if you choose
            to install the <quote>crypto</quote> distribution in
            sysinstall, or by installing the crypto sources if building
            from source). Which password format to use for new passwords is
            controlled by the <quote>passwd_format</quote> login capability
            in <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>, which takes values of
            either <quote>des</quote> (if available) or <quote>md5</quote>.
            See the login.conf(5) manpage for more information about login
            capabilities.</para>

          <para>I get a <literal>panic: cant mount root</literal>
            error when rebooting the system after installation.</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This error comes from confusion between the boot block's
            and the kernel's understanding of the disk devices. The error
            usually manifests on two-disk IDE systems, with the hard disks
            arranged as the master or single device on separate IDE
            controllers, with FreeBSD installed on the secondary IDE
            controller. The boot blocks think the system is installed on
            wd1 (the second BIOS disk) while the kernel assigns the first
            disk on the secondary controller device wd2. After the device
            probing, the kernel tries to mount what the boot blocks think
            is the boot disk, wd1, while it is really wd2, and
            fails.</para>

          <para>To fix the problem, do one of the following:</para>

          <para>
            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>For FreeBSD 3.3 and later, reboot the system and hit

                  in 10 seconds; hit [Enter] to interrupt</literal> prompt.

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>For ffs filesystems, the maximum theoretical limit is 8
            terabytes (2G blocks), or 16TB for the default block size of
            8K. In practice, there is a soft limit of 1 terabyte, but with
            modifications filesystems with 4 terabytes are possible (and
            exist).</para>

          <para>The maximum size of a single ffs file is approximately 1G
            blocks (4TB) if the block size is 4K.</para>

          <para>When the fs block size is 4K, triple indirect blocks work
            and everything should be limited by the maximum fs block number
            that can be represented using triple indirect blocks (approx.
            1K^3 + 1K^2 + 1K), but everything is limited by a (wrong) limit
            of 1G-1 on fs block numbers. The limit on fs block numbers
            should be 2G-1. There are some bugs for fs block numbers near
            2G-1, but such block numbers are unreachable when the fs block
            size is 4K.</para>

          <para>For block sizes of 8K and larger, everything should be
            limited by the 2G-1 limit on fs block numbers, but is actually
            limited by the 1G-1 limit on fs block numbers, except under
            -STABLE triple indirect blocks are unreachable, so the limit is
            the maxiumum fs block number that can be represented using
            double indirect blocks (approx. (blocksize/4)^2 +
            (blocksize/4)), and under -CURRENT exceeding this limit may
            cause problems. Using the correct limit of 2G-1 blocks does
            cause problems.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>I keep several virtual ones on floppies :-).  The maxiumum
            file size is not closely related to the maximum disk size. The
            maximum disk size is 1TB. It is a feature that the file size
            can be larger than the disk size.</para>

          <para>The following example creates a file of size 8T-1 using a
            whole 32K of disk space (3 indirect blocks and 1 data block) on
            a small root partition. The dd command requires a dd that works
            with large files.</para>

          <para>FreeBSD supports the SCSI ZIP drive out of the box, of
            course. The ZIP drive can only be set to run at SCSI target IDs
            5 or 6, but if your SCSI host adapter's BIOS supports it you
            can even boot from it. I don't know which host adapters let you
            boot from targets other than 0 or 1... look at your docs (and
            let me know if it works out for you).</para>

          <para>ATAPI (IDE) Zip drives are supported in FreeBSD 2.2.6 and
            later releases.</para>

          <para>FreeBSD has contained support for Parallel Port Zip Drives
            since version 3.0. If you are using a sufficiently up to date
            version, then you should check that your kernel contains the
            <devicename>scbus0</devicename>, <devicename>da0</devicename>,
            <devicename>ppbus0</devicename>, and
            <devicename>vp0</devicename> drivers (the GENERIC kernel
            contains everything except <devicename>vp0</devicename>). With
            all these drivers present, the Parallel Port drive should be
            available as <filename>/dev/da0s4</filename>. Disks can be
            mounted using <command>mount /dev/da0s4 /mnt</command> OR (for

        <answer>
          <para>FreeBSD supports the bus mouse and the InPort bus mouse
            from such manufactures as Microsoft, Logitech and ATI. The bus
            device driver is compiled in the GENERIC kernel by default in
            FreeBSD versions 2.X, but not included in version 3.0 or later.
            If you are building a custom kernel with the bus mouse driver,
            make sure to add the following line to the kernel config
            file</para>

          <para>In FreeBSD 3.0 or before, add:</para>

          <programlisting>device mse0 at isa? port 0x23c tty irq5 vector mseintr</programlisting>

          <para>In FreeBSD 3.X, the line should be:</para>

          <programlisting>device mse0 at isa? port 0x23c tty irq5</programlisting>

          <para>And in FreeBSD 4.X and later, the line should read:</para>

          <programlisting>device mse0 at isa? port 0x23c irq5</programlisting>

          <para>Bus mice usually comes with dedicated interface cards.
            These cards may allow you to set the port address and the IRQ

        <answer>

          <para>If you're running a post-2.2.5 version of FreeBSD, the
            necessary driver, <devicename>psm</devicename>, is included and
            enabled in the kernel. The kernel should detect your PS/2 mouse
            at boot time.</para>

          <para>If you're running a previous but relatively recent version
            of FreeBSD (2.1.x or better) then you can simply enable it in
            the kernel configuration menu at installation time, otherwise
            later with <option>-c</option> at the <command>boot:</command>
            prompt. It is disabled by default, so you will need to enable
            it explicitly.</para>

          <para>If you're running an older version of FreeBSD then you'll
            have to add the following lines to your kernel configuration
            file and compile a new kernel.</para>

          <para>In FreeBSD 3.0 or earlier, the line should be:</para>

          <programlisting>device psm0 at isa? port "IO_KBD" conflicts tty irq 12 vector psmintr</programlisting>

          <para>In FreeBSD 3.1 or later, the line should be:</para>

          <programlisting>device psm0 at isa? tty irq 12</programlisting>

          <para>In FreeBSD 4.0 or later, the line should be:</para>

          <programlisting>device psm0 at atkbdc? irq 12</programlisting>

          <para>See the <ulink

          <para>Once you have a kernel detecting

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you are using the default console driver, syscons, you
            can use a mouse pointer in text consoles to cut &amp; paste
            text. Run the mouse daemon, moused, and turn on the mouse
            pointer in the virtual console:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>moused -p /dev/<replaceable>xxxx</replaceable> -t <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>vidcontrol -m on</userinput></screen>

          <para>Where <replaceable>xxxx</replaceable> is the mouse device
            name and <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable> is a protocol type for
            the mouse.  See the &man.moused.8; man page for supported
            protocol types.</para>

          <para>You may wish to run the mouse daemon automatically when the
            system starts.  In version 2.2.1, set the following variables in
            <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>.</para>

          <programlisting>mousedtype="yyyy"
mousedport="xxxx"
mousedflags=""</programlisting>

          <para>In versions 2.2.2 to 3.0, set the following variables in

          <programlisting>moused_type="yyyy"
moused_port="xxxx"
moused_flags=""</programlisting>

          <para>In 3.1 and later, assuming you have a PS/2 mouse, all you
            need to is add <literal>moused_enable="YES"</literal> to
            <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para> 

          <para>In addition, if you would like to be able to use the mouse
            daemon on all virtual terminals instead of just console at
            boot-time, add the following to
            <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

          <programlisting>allscreens_flags="-m on"</programlisting>

          <para>Staring from FreeBSD 2.2.6, the mouse daemon is capable of
            determining the correct protocol type automatically unless the
            mouse is a relatively old serial mouse model. Specify
            <literal>auto</literal> the protocol to invoke automatic
            detection.</para>

          <para>When the mouse daemon is running, access to the mouse
            needs to be coordinated between the mouse daemon and other
            programs such as the X Window. Refer to <link

        <answer>
          <para>Once you get the mouse daemon running (see

            (right button) to paste it at the text cursor.</para>

          <para>In versions 2.2.6 and later, pressing the button 2 will
            paste the text. Pressing the button 3 will
            <quote>extend</quote> the selected region of text. If your

          <para>I have an internal Plug &amp; Play modem and FreeBSD
            can't find it.</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>You will need to add the modem's PnP ID to the PnP ID
            list in the serial driver. To enable Plug &amp; Play support,
            compile a new kernel with <literal>controller pnp0</literal> in
            the configuration file, then reboot the system. The kernel will
            print the PnP IDs of all the devices it finds. Copy the PnP ID
            from the modem to the table in
            <filename>/sys/i386/isa/sio.c</filename>, at about line 2777.
            Look for the string <literal>SUP1310</literal> in the structure
            <literal>siopnp_ids[]</literal> to find the table. Build the
            kernel again, install, reboot, and your modem should be
            found.</para>

          <para>You may have to manually configure the PnP devices using
            the <literal>pnp</literal> command in the boot-time
            configuration with a command like

          <programlisting>pnp 1 0 enable os irq0 3 drq0 0 port0 0x2f8</programlisting>

          <para>The following paragraphs were submitted by <ulink
            URL="mailto:tedm@toybox.placo.com">
            Ted Mittelstaedt</ulink>:</para>

          <para>For IDE drives, any bad block is usually a sign of
            potential trouble. All modern IDE drives come with internal
            bad-block remapping turned on. All IDE hard drive manufacturers
            today offer extensive warranties and will replace drives with
            bad blocks on them.</para>

          <para>If you still want to attempt to rescue an IDE drive with
            bad blocks, you can attempt to download the IDE drive
            manufacturer's IDE diagnostic program, and run this against the
            drive. Sometimes these programs can be set to force the drive
            electronics to rescan the drive for bad blocks and lock them
            out.</para>

          <para>For ESDI, RLL and MFM drives, bad blocks are a normal part
            of the drive and are no sign of trouble, generally. With a PC,
            the disk drive controller card and BIOS handle the task of
            locking out bad sectors. This is fine for operating systems
            like DOS that use BIOS code to access the disk. However,
            FreeBSD's disk driver does not go through BIOS, therefore a
            mechanism, bad144, exists that replaces this functionality.
            bad144 only works with the wd driver (which means it is not
            supported in FreeBSD 4.0), it is NOT able to be used with SCSI.
            bad144 works by entering all bad sectors found into a special
            file.</para>

          <para>One caveat with bad144 - the bad block special file is
            placed on the last track of the disk. As this file may possibly
            contain a listing for a bad sector that would occur near the
            beginning of the disk, where the /kernel file might be located,
            it therefore must be accessible to the bootstrap program that
            uses BIOS calls to read the kernel file. This means that the
            disk with bad144 used on it must not exceed 1024 cylinders, 16
            heads, and 63 sectors. This places an effective limit of 500MB
            on a disk that is mapped with bad144.</para>

          <para>To use bad144, simply set the <quote>Bad Block</quote>
            scanning to ON in the FreeBSD fdisk screen during the initial
            install. This works up through FreeBSD 2.2.7. The disk must
            have less than 1024 cylinders. It is generally recommended that
            the disk drive has been in operation for at least 4 hours prior
            to this to allow for thermal expansion and track
            wandering.</para>

          <para>If the disk has more than 1024 cylinders (such as a large
            ESDI drive) the ESDI controller uses a special translation mode
            to make it work under DOS. The wd driver understands about
            these translation modes, IF you enter the
            <quote>translated</quote> geometry with the <quote>set
            geometry</quote> command in fdisk. You must also NOT use the
            <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> mode of creating the
            FreeBSD partition, as this ignores the geometry. Also, even
            though fdisk will use your overridden geometry, it still knows
            the true size of the disk, and will attempt to create a too
            large FreeBSD partition. If the disk geometry is changed to the
            translated geometry, the partition MUST be manually created
            with the number of blocks.</para>

          <para>A quick trick to use is to set up the large ESDI disk with
            the ESDI controller, boot it with a DOS disk and format it with
            a DOS partition. Then, boot the FreeBSD install and in the
            fdisk screen, read off and write down the blocksize and block
            numbers for the DOS partition. Then, reset the geometry to the
            same that DOS uses, delete the DOS partition, and create a
            <quote>cooperative</quote> FreeBSD partition using the
            blocksize you recorded earlier. Then, set the partition
            bootable and turn on bad block scanning. During the actual
            install, bad144 will run first, before any filesystems are
            created. (you can view this with an Alt-F2) If it has any
            trouble creating the badsector file, you have set too large a
            disk geometry - reboot the system and start all over again
            (including repartitioning and reformatting with DOS).</para>

          <para>If remapping is enabled and you are seeing bad blocks,
            consider replacing the drive. The bad blocks will only get
            worse as time goes on.</para>

        <question>
          <para>FreeBSD does not recognize my Bustek 742a EISA SCSI!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This info is specific to the 742a but may also cover
            other Buslogic cards.  (Bustek = Buslogic)</para>

          <para>There are 2 general <quote>versions</quote> of the 742a
            card. They are hardware revisions A-G, and revisions H -
            onwards. The revision letter is located after the Assembly
            number on the edge of the card. The 742a has 2 ROM chips on it,
            one is the BIOS chip and the other is the Firmware chip.
            FreeBSD doesn't care what version of BIOS chip you have but it
            does care about what version of firmware chip. Buslogic will
            send upgrade ROMS out if you call their tech support dept. The
            BIOS and Firmware chips are shipped as a matched pair. You must
            have the most current Firmware ROM in your adapter card for
            your hardware revision.</para>

          <para>The REV A-G cards can only accept BIOS/Firmware sets up to
            2.41/2.21. The REV H- up cards can accept the most current
            BIOS/Firmware sets of 4.70/3.37. The difference between the
            firmware sets is that the 3.37 firmware supports <quote>round
            robin</quote></para>

          <para>The Buslogic cards also have a serial number on them.  If
            you have a old hardware revision card you can call the Buslogic
            RMA department and give them the serial number and attempt to
            exchange the card for a newer hardware revision. If the card is
            young enough they will do so.</para>

          <para>FreeBSD 2.1 only supports Firmware revisions 2.21 onward.
            If you have a Firmware revision older than this your card will
            not be recognized as a Buslogic card. It may be recognized as
            an Adaptec 1540, however. The early Buslogic firmware contains
            an AHA1540 <quote>emulation</quote> mode. This is not a good
            thing for an EISA card, however.</para>

          <para>If you have an old hardware revision card and you obtain
            the 2.21 firmware for it, you will need to check the position
            of jumper W1 to B-C, the default is A-B.</para>

          <para>My HP Netserver's SCSI controller is not detected!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is basically a known problem.  The EISA on-board SCSI
            controller in the HP Netserver machines occupies EISA slot
            number 11, so all the <quote>true</quote> EISA slots are in
            front of it. Alas, the address space for EISA slots &gt;= 10
            collides with the address space assigned to PCI, and FreeBSD's
            auto-configuration currently cannot handle this situation very
            well.</para>

          <para>So now, the best you can do is to pretend there is no
            address range clash :), by bumping the kernel option
            <literal>EISA_SLOTS</literal> to a value of 12. Configure and
            compile a kernel, as described in the <ulink
            URL="../handbook/kernelconfig.html">Handbook entry on
            configuring the kernel</ulink>.</para>

          <para>Of course, this does present you with a chicken-and-egg
            problem when installing on such a machine. In order to work
            around this problem, a special hack is available inside
            <emphasis>UserConfig</emphasis>. Do not use the
            <quote>visual</quote> interface, but the plain command-line

          <programlisting>eisa 12
quit</programlisting>

          <para>at the prompt, and install your system as usual.  While
            it's recommended you compile and install a custom kernel
            anyway,</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is usually caused by an interrupt conflict (e.g.,
            two boards using the same IRQ). FreeBSD prior to 2.0.5R used to
            be tolerant of this, and the network driver would still
            function in the presence of IRQ conflicts. However, with 2.0.5R
            and later, IRQ conflicts are no longer tolerated. Boot with the
            -c option and change the ed0/de0/... entry to match your

          <para>If you're using the BNC connector on your network card,

            cable) and see if the error messages go away. </para>

          <para>When I mount a CDROM, I get
            <literal>Incorrect super block</literal>.</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>You have to tell <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount(8)">mount</ulink>
            the type of the device that you want to mount.  By default,
            <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount(8)">mount(8)</ulink>
            will assume the filesystem is of type <literal>ufs</literal>.
            You want to mount a CDROM filesystem, and you do this by
            specifying the <option>-t cd9660</option> option to <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount(8)">
            mount(8)</ulink>.  This does, of course, assume that the
            CDROM contains an ISO 9660 filesystem, which is what most CDROMs
            have.  As of 1.1R, FreeBSD automatically understands the Rock
            Ridge (long filename) extensions as well.</para>

          <para>As an example, if you want to mount the CDROM device,
            <filename>/dev/cd0c</filename>, under <filename>/mnt</filename>,
            you would execute:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0c /mnt</userinput></screen>

          <para>Note that your device name (<filename>/dev/cd0c</filename>
            in this example) could be different, depending on the CDROM

          <para>This generally means that there is no CDROM in the CDROM
            drive, or the drive is not visible on the bus. Feed the drive
            something, and/or check its master/slave status if it is IDE
            (ATAPI). It can take a couple of seconds for a CDROM drive to
            notice that it's been fed, so be patient.</para>

          <para>My programs occasionally die with
            <literal>Signal 11</literal> errors.</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Signal 11 errors are caused when your process has attempted
            to access memory which the operating system has not granted it
            access to. If something like this is happening at seemingly
            random intervals then you need to start investigating things
            very carefully.</para>

          <para>These problems can usually be attributed to either:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If the problem is occurring only in a specific
                application that you are developing yourself it is probably
                a bug in your code.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>If it's a problem with part of the base FreeBSD system,
                it may also be buggy code, but more often than not these
                problems are found and fixed long before us general FAQ
                readers get to use these bits of code (that's what -current
                is for).</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <para>In particular, a dead giveaway that this is *not* a FreeBSD
            bug is if you see the problem when you're compiling a program,
            but the activity that the compiler is carrying out changes
            each time.</para>

          <para>For example, suppose you're running "make buildworld", and
            the compile fails while trying to compile ls.c in to ls.o. If
            you next run "make buildworld" again, and the compile fails in
            the same place then this is a broken build -- try updating your
            sources and try again. If the compile fails elsewhere then this
            is almost certainly hardware.</para>

          <para>What you should do:</para>

          <para>In the first case you can use a debugger e.g. gdb to find
            the point in the program which is attempting to access a bogus
            address and then fix it.</para>

          <para>In the second case you need to verify that it's not your
            hardware at fault.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>This is a known problem with the ATI Mach 64 video card.
              The problem is that this card uses address
              <literal>2e8</literal>, and the fourth serial port does too.
              Due to a bug (feature?) in the <ulink

              driver it will touch this port even if you don't have the

        <answer>
          <para>Due to the manner in which FreeBSD gets the memory size
            from the BIOS, it can only detect 16 bits worth of Kbytes in
            size (65535 Kbytes = 64MB) (or less... some BIOSes peg the
            memory size to 16M). If you have more than 64MB, FreeBSD will
            attempt to detect it; however, the attempt may fail.</para>

          <para>To work around this problem, you need to use the kernel

            bootblocks to do it. Someday when lack of room in the
            bootblocks is fixed, we'll use the extended BIOS functions to

          <para>My machine prints
            <literal>calcru: negative time...</literal></para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This can be caused by various hardware and/or software
            ailments relating to interrupts. It may be due to bugs but can
            also happen by nature of certain devices. Running TCP/IP over
            the parallel port using a large MTU is one good way to provoke
            this problem. Graphics accelerators can also get you here, in
            which case you should check the interrupt setting of the card
            first.</para>

          <para>A side effect of this problem are dying processes with the
            message <quote>SIGXCPU exceeded cpu time limit</quote>.</para>

          <para>For FreeBSD 3.0 and later from Nov 29, 1998 forward: If the
            problem cannot be fixed otherwise the solution is to set
            this sysctl variable:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w kern.timecounter.method=1</userinput></screen>

          <para> This means a performance impact, but considering the cause
            of this problem, you probably will not notice. If the problem
            persists, keep the sysctl set to one and set the
            <literal>NTIMECOUNTER</literal> option in your kernel to
            increasingly large values. If by the time you have reached
            <literal>NTIMECOUNTER=20</literal> the problem isn't solved,
            interrupts are too hosed on your machine for reliable
            timekeeping.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I see <literal>pcm0 not found</literal> or my sound card is
            found as <literal>pcm1</literal> but I have
            <literal>device pcm0</literal> in my kernel config file</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This occurs in FreeBSD 3.x with PCI sound cards. The
            <literal>pcm0</literal> device is reserved exclusively for
            ISA-based cards so, if you have a PCI card, then you will see
            this error, and your card will appear as <literal>pcm1</literal>.

            <note>
              <para>You cannot remove the warning by simply changing the
                line in the kernel config file to <literal>device
                pcm1</literal> as this will result in
                <literal>pcm1</literal> being reserved for ISA cards and
                your PCI card being found as <literal>pcm2</literal> (along
                with the warning <literal>pcm1 not found</literal>).</para>
            </note>

            If you have a PCI sound card you will also have to make the
            <literal>snd1</literal> device rather than
            <literal>snd0</literal>:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./MAKEDEV snd1</userinput></screen>

          <para>This situation does not arise in FreeBSD 4.x as has a lot
            of work has been done to make the it more
            <emphasis>PnP-centric</emphasis> and the
            <literal>pcm0</literal> device is no longer reserved
            exclusively fo ISA cards</para>

        <question>
          <para>My PnP card is no longer found (or found as
            <literal>unknown</literal>) since upgrading to FreeBSD 4.x</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>FreeBSD 4.x is now much more <emphasis>PnP-centric</emphasis>
            and this has had the side effect of some PnP devices (e.g. sound
            cards and internal modems) not working even though they worked
            under FreeBSD 3.x.</para>

          <para>The reasons for this behaviour are explained by the following
            e-mail, posted to the freebsd-questions mailing list by Peter
            Wemm, in answer to a question about an internal modem that was
            no longer found after an upgrade to FreeBSD 4.x (the comments
            in <literal>[]</literal> have been added to clarify the
            context.</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para>The PNP bios preconfigured it [the modem] and left it
              laying around in port space, so [in 3.x] the old-style ISA
              probes <quote>found</quote> it there.</para>

            <para>Under 4.0, the ISA code is much more PnP-centric. It was
              possible [in 3.x] for an ISA probe to find a
              <quote>stray</quote> device and then for the PNP device id to
              match and then fail due to resource conflicts. So, it
              disables the programmable cards first so this double probing
              cannot happen. It also means that it needs to know the PnP
              id's for supported PnP hardware. Making this more user
              tweakable is on the TODO list.</para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>To get the device working again requires finding its PnP id
            and adding it to the list that the ISA probes use to identify
            PnP devices. This is obtained using &man.pnpinfo.8; to probe the
            device, for example this is the output from &man.pnpinfo.8; for
            an internal modem:</para>

          <para>The information you require is in the

            hexadecimal number in parentheses (0x3024a341 in this example)
            is the PnP id and the string immediately before this (PMC2430)

          </programlisting>

          <para>Add the hexadecimal Vendor ID for your device in the
            correct place, save the file, rebuild your kernel, and reboot.
            Your device should now be found as an <literal>sio</literal>

        <para>This section is still very sparse, though we're hoping, of

          <para>So, where are all the user applications?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Please take a look at
            <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/">the ports
            page</ulink> for info on software packages ported to FreeBSD.
            The list currently tops 3400 and is growing daily, so come back
            to check often or subscribe to the
            <literal>freebsd-announce</literal> <link
            linkend="mailing">mailing list</link> for periodic updates on
            new entries.</para>

          <para>Most ports should be available for the 2.2, 3.x and 4.x
            branches, and many of them should work on 2.1.x systems as
            well. Each time a FreeBSD release is made, a snapshot of the
            ports tree at the time of release in also included in the
            <filename>ports/</filename> directory.</para>

          <para>We also support the concept of a <quote>package</quote>,
            essentially no more than a gzipped binary distribution with a
            little extra intelligence embedded in it for doing whatever
            custom installation work is required. A package can be
            installed and uninstalled again easily without having to know
            the gory details of which files it includes.</para>

          <para>Use the package installation menu in
            <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename> (under the
            post-configuration menu item) or invoke the
            <command>pkg_add(1)</command> command on the specific package
            files you're interested in installing. Package files can
            usually be identified by their <filename>.tgz</filename> suffix
            and CDROM distribution people will have a
            <filename>packages/All</filename> directory on their CD which
            contains such files. They can also be downloaded over the net
            for various versions of FreeBSD at the following
            locations:</para>

        <question>
          <para>Why is <command>/bin/sh</command> so minimal?  Why doesn't
            FreeBSD use <command>bash</command> or another shell?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Because POSIX says that there shall be such a shell.</para>

          <para>The more complicated answer: many people need to write shell
            scripts which will be portable across many systems. That's why
            POSIX specifies the shell and utility commands in great detail.
            Most scripts are written in Bourne shell, and because several
            important programming interfaces (&man.make.1;, &man.system.3;,
            &man.popen.3;, and analogues in higher-level scripting
            languages like Perl and Tcl) are specified to use the Bourne
            shell to interpret commands. Because the Bourne shell is so
            often and widely used, it is important for it to be quick to
            start, be deterministic in its behavior, and have a small
            memory footprint.</para>

          <para>The existing implementation is our best effort at meeting as
            many of these requirements simultaneously as we can. In order to
            keep <command>/bin/sh</command> small, we have not provided many
            of the convenience features that other shells have. That's why the
            Ports Collection includes more featureful shells like bash, scsh,
            tcsh, and zsh.  (You can compare for yourself the memory
            utilization of all these shells by looking at the
            <quote>VSZ</quote> and <quote>RSS</quote> columns in a <command>ps
              -u</command> listing.)</para>

          <para>If you're running a FreeBSD version that lags

            works for -CURRENT but which broke the port for -STABLE. Please
            submit a bug report on this with the
            <command>send-pr(1)</command> command, since the ports

            greatly increasing the size of the kernel.  Note that if you
            running a FreeBSD 3.0 or later system, there will be little
            or no performance decrease from running a debug kernel,
            and it is useful to keep one around in case of a system
            panic.</para>

          <para>However, if you are running low on disk space, or
            you simply don't want to run a debug kernel, make sure
            that both of the following are true:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>You do not have a line in your kernel
                configuration file that reads:</para>

              <programlisting>makeoptions DEBUG=-g</programlisting>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>You are not running <command>config</command> with
                the <option>-g</option> option.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Both of the above situations will cause your kernel to
            be built in debug mode.  As long as you make sure you follow
            the steps above, you can build your kernel normally, and you
            should notice a fairly large size decrease; most kernels
            tend to be around 1.5MB to 2MB.</para>

        <answer>
          <para><emphasis remap=bf>Q.</emphasis> When I compile a kernel

          <para><emphasis remap=bf>A.</emphasis> The problem here is that
            FreeBSD has code built-in to keep the kernel from getting
            trashed due to hardware or software conflicts. The way to fix
            this is to leave out the IRQ settings on all but one port. Here

          <para>Where are the system start-up configuration files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>From 2.0.5R to 2.2.1R, the primary configuration file is
            <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>. All the options are to be
            specified in this file and other files such as <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc(8)">/etc/rc</ulink>
            and <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> just include it.</para>

          <para>Look in the <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> file and
            change the value to match your system. This file is filled with
            comments to show what to put in there.</para>

          <para>In post-2.2.1 and 3.0, <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>
            was renamed to a more self-describing <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf(5)">rc.conf</ulink>
            file and the syntax cleaned up a bit in the process.
            <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> was also renamed to
            <filename>/etc/rc.network</filename> so that all files could be
            copied with a <command><ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?cp(1)">cp</ulink>
            /usr/src/etc/rc* /etc</command> command.</para>

          <para>And, in 3.1 and later, <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
            has been moved to <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename>.
            <emphasis>Do not edit this file!</emphasis> Instead, if there
            is any entry in <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> that
            you want to change, you should copy the line into
            <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and change it there.</para>

          <para>For example, if you wish to start named, the DNS server
            included with FreeBSD in FreeBSD 3.1 or later, all you need to
            do is:</para>
          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo named_enable="YES" &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf</userinput></screen>

          <para>To start up local services in FreeBSD 3.1 or later, place
            shell scripts in the <filename>/usr/local/etc.rd</filename>
            directory. These shell scripts should be set executable, and
            end with a .sh. In FreeBSD 3.0 and earlier releases, you should
            edit the <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> file.</para>

          <para>The <filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename> is for serial port
            initialization (e.g. locking the port characteristics, and so
            on.).</para>

          <para>The <filename>/etc/rc.i386</filename> is for Intel-specifics

        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>Whether it's a removable drive like a ZIP or an EZ drive 
            (or even a floppy, if you want to use it that way), or a new
            hard disk, once it's installed and recognized by the system,
            and you have your cartridge/floppy/whatever slotted in, things
            are pretty much the same for all devices.</para>

          <para><anchor id="disklabel">(this section is based on <ulink
            URL="http://www.vmunix.com/mark/FreeBSD/ZIP-FAQ.html">
            Mark Mayo's ZIP FAQ</ulink>)</para>

          <para>If it's a ZIP drive or a floppy , you've already got a DOS
            filesystem on it, you can use a command like this:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0c /floppy</userinput></screen>

          <para>if it's a floppy, or this:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdos /dev/da2s4 /zip</userinput></screen>

          <para>for a ZIP disk with the factory configuration.</para>

          <para>For other disks, see how they're laid out using
            <command>fdisk</command> or
            <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>.</para>

          <para>The rest of the examples will be for a ZIP drive on da2,
            the third SCSI disk.</para>

          <para>Unless it's a floppy, or a removable you plan on sharing
            with other people, it's probably a better idea to stick a BSD
            file system on it. You'll get long filename support, at least a
            2X improvement in performance, and a lot more stability. First,
            you need to redo the DOS-level partitions/filesystems. You can
            either use <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?fdisk">fdisk</ulink> or
            <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>, or for a small drive
            that you don't want to bother with multiple operating system
            support on, just blow away the whole FAT partition table
            (slices) and just use the BSD partitioning:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rda2 count=2</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -Brw da2 auto</userinput></screen>

          <para>You can use disklabel or
            <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename> to create multiple BSD
            partitions. You'll certainly want to do this if you're adding
            swap space on a fixed disk, but it's probably irrelevant on a
            removable drive like a ZIP.</para>

          <para>Finally, create a new file system, this one's on our ZIP
            drive using the whole disk:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/rda2c</userinput></screen>

          <para>and mount it:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/da2c /zip</userinput></screen>

          <para>and it's probably a good idea to add a line like this to
            <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?fstab">
            /etc/fstab</ulink> so you can just type
            <command>mount /zip</command> in the future:</para>

          <para>Why do I keep getting messages like <errorname>root: not
            found</errorname> after editing my crontab file?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is normally caused by editing the system crontab
            (<filename>/etc/crontab</filename>) and then using
            &man.crontab.1; to install it:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>crontab /etc/crontab</userinput></screen>

          <para>This is not the correct way to do things.  The system
            crontab has a different format to the per-user crontabs
            which &man.crontab.1; updates (the &man.crontab.5; manual
            page explains the differences in more detail).</para>

          <para>If this is what you did, you should delete the
            <filename>/var/cron/tabs/root</filename>, since it will
            simply be a copy of <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>,
            in the wrong format.  Next time, when you edit
            <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>, you should not do
            anything to inform &man.cron.8; of the changes, since it
            will notice them automatically.</para>

          <para>The actual reason for the error is that the system
            crontab has an extra field, specifying which user to run the
            command as.  In the default system crontab provided with
            FreeBSD, this is <username>root</username> for all entries.
            When this crontab is used as the <username>root</username>
            user's crontab (which is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the
            same as the system crontab), &man.cron.8; assumes the string
            <literal>root</literal> is the first word of the command to
            execute, but no such command exists.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>When you get the prompt to enter the shell

            <command>mount /</command> to re-mount the root filesystem in

            ufs</command> to mount the filesystem where your favourite
            editor is defined. If your favourite editor is on a network
            filesystem, you will need to either configure the network
            manually before you can mount network filesystems, or use an
            editor which resides on a local filesystem, such as
            &man.ed.1;.</para>

          <para>If you intend to use a full screen editor such
            as &man.vi.1; or &man.emacs.1;, you may also need to

          <para>Once you have performed these steps, you can edit

        <answer>
          <para>This procedure is slightly different for 2.2.x and 3.x
            (with the 3-stage boot) systems.</para>

          <para>The general idea is that you copy the first sector of your
            native root FreeBSD partition into a file in the DOS/NT
            partition. Assuming you name that file something like
            <filename>c:\bootsect.bsd</filename> (inspired by
            <filename>c:\bootsect.dos</filename>), you can then edit the
            <filename>c:\boot.ini</filename> file to come up with something
            like this:</para>

          <programlisting>[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT"
C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="FreeBSD"
C:\="DOS"</programlisting>

          <para>For 2.2.x systems this procedure assumes that DOS, NT,
            FreeBSD, or whatever have been installed into their respective
            fdisk partitions on the <emphasis remap=bf>same</emphasis>
            disk. In my case DOS &amp; NT are in the first fdisk partition
            and FreeBSD is in the second. I also installed FreeBSD to boot
            from its native partition, <emphasis remap=bf>not</emphasis>
            the disk MBR.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you have FreeBSD and Linux on the same disk, just follow
            LILO's installation instructions for booting a non-Linux
            operating system.  Very briefly, these are:</para>

          <para>Boot Linux, and add the following lines to
            <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>:
            <programlisting>other=/dev/hda2
        table=/dev/hda
        label=FreeBSD</programlisting>

            (the above assumes that your FreeBSD slice is known to Linux
            as <filename>/dev/hda2</filename>; tailor to suit your setup).
            Then, run <command>lilo</command> as root and you should be
            done.</para>

          <para>If FreeBSD resides on another disk, you need to add
            <literal>loader=/boot/chain.b</literal> to the LILO entry.
            For example:
          <programlisting>other=/dev/dab4
        table=/dev/dab
        loader=/boot/chain.b
        label=FreeBSD</programlisting></para>

          <para>In some cases you may need to specify the BIOS drive number
            to the FreeBSD boot loader to successfully boot off the second
            disk.  For example, if your FreeBSD SCSI disk is probed by BIOS
            as BIOS disk 1, at the FreeBSD boot loader prompt you need to
            specify:</para>

          <screen>Boot: <userinput>1:da(0,a)/kernel</userinput></screen>

          <para>On FreeBSD 2.2.5 and later, you can configure <ulink

          <para>Will a <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk endanger
            my health?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para><anchor id="dedicate">The installation procedure allows
            you to chose two different methods in partitioning your
            harddisk(s). The default way makes it compatible with other
            operating systems on the same machine, by using fdisk table
            entries (called <quote>slices</quote> in FreeBSD), with a
            FreeBSD slice that employs partitions of its own. Optionally,
            one can chose to install a boot-selector to switch between the
            possible operating systems on the disk(s). The alternative uses
            the entire disk for FreeBSD, and makes no attempt to be
            compatible with other operating systems.</para>

          <para>So why it is called <quote>dangerous</quote>?  A disk in
            this mode doesn't contain what normal PC utilities would
            consider a valid fdisk table. Depending on how well they have
            been designed, they might complain at you once they are getting
            in contact with such a disk, or even worse, they might damage
            the BSD bootstrap without even asking or notifying you. In
            addition, the <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk's
            layout is known to confuse many BIOSsen, including those from
            AWARD (eg. as found in HP Netserver and Micronics systems as
            well as many others) and Symbios/NCR (for the popular 53C8xx
            range of SCSI controllers). This isn't a complete list, there
            are more. Symptoms of this confusion include the <quote>read
            error</quote> message printed by the FreeBSD bootstrap when it
            can't find itself, as well as system lockups when
            booting.</para>

          <para>Why have this mode at all then?  It only saves a few kbytes
            of disk space, and it can cause real problems for a new
            installation. <quote>Dangerously dedicated</quote> mode's
            origins lie in a desire to avoid one of the most common
            problems plaguing new FreeBSD installers - matching the BIOS
            <quote>geometry</quote> numbers for a disk to the disk
            itself.</para>

          <para><quote>Geometry</quote> is an outdated concept, but one
            still at the heart of the PC's BIOS and its interaction with
            disks. When the FreeBSD installer creates slices, it has to
            record the location of these slices on the disk in a fashion
            that corresponds with the way the BIOS expects to find them. If
            it gets it wrong, you won't be able to boot.</para>

          <para><quote>Dangerously dedicated</quote> mode tries to work
            around this by making the problem simpler. In some cases, it
            gets it right. But it's meant to be used as a last-ditch
            alternative - there are better ways to solve the problem 99
            times out of 100.</para>

          <para>So, how do you avoid the need for <quote>DD</quote> mode
            when you're installing? Start by making a note of the geometry
            that your BIOS claims to be using for your disks. You can
            arrange to have the kernel print this as it boots by specifying
            <option>-v</option> at the <literal>boot:</literal> prompt, or
            using <command>boot -v</command> in the loader. Just before the
            installer starts, the kernel will print a list of BIOS
            geometries. Don't panic - wait for the installer to start and
            then use scrollback to read the numbers. Typically the BIOS
            disk units will be in the same order that FreeBSD lists your
            disks, first IDE, then SCSI.</para>

          <para>When you're slicing up your disk, check that the disk
            geometry displayed in the FDISK screen is correct (ie. it
            matches the BIOS numbers); if it's wrong, use the
            <literal>g</literal> key to fix it. You may have to do this if
            there's absolutely nothing on the disk, or if the disk has been
            moved from another system. Note that this is only an issue with
            the disk that you're going to boot from; FreeBSD will sort
            itself out just fine with any other disks you may have.</para>

          <para>Once you've got the BIOS and FreeBSD agreeing about the
            geometry of the disk, your problems are almost guaranteed to be
            over, and with no need for <quote>DD</quote> mode at all. If,
            however, you are still greeted with the dreaded <quote>read
            error</quote> message when you try to boot, it's time to cross
            your fingers and go for it - there's nothing left to
            lose.</para>

          <para>To return a <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk
            for normal PC use, there are basically two options. The first
            is, you write enough NULL bytes over the MBR to make any
            subsequent installation believe this to be a blank disk. You
            can do this for example with</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rda0 count=15</userinput></screen>

          <para>Alternatively, the undocumented DOS
            <quote>feature</quote></para>

          <screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>fdisk /mbr</userinput></screen>

          <para>will to install a new master boot record as well, thus
            clobbering the BSD bootstrap.</para>

        <question>
          <para>How can I add more swap space?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>The best way is to increase the size of your swap partition,
            or take advantage of this convenient excuse to add another
            disk. The general rule of thumb is to have around 2x the swap
            space as you have main memory. However, if you have a very
            small amount of main memory you may want to configure swap
            beyond that. It is also a good idea to configure sufficient
            swap relative to anticipated future memory upgrades so you do
            not have to futz with your swap configuration later.</para>

          <para>Adding swap onto a separate disk makes things faster than
            simply adding swap onto the same disk. As an example, if you
            are compiling source located on one disk, and the swap is on
            another disk, this is much faster than both swap and compile on
            the same disk. This is true for SCSI disks specifically.</para>

          <para>When you have several disks, configuring a swap partition on
            each one is usually beneficial, even if you wind up putting
            swap on a work disk. Typically, each fast disk in your system
            should have some swap configured. FreeBSD supports up to 4
            interleaved swap devices by default. When configuring multiple
            swap partitions you generally want to make them all about the
            same size, but people sometimes make their primary swap
            parition larger in order to accomodate a kernel core dump. Your
            primary swap partition must be at least as large as main memory
            in order to be able to accomodate a kernel core.</para>

          <para>IDE drives are not able to allow access to both drives on
            the same channel at the same time (FreeBSD doesn't support mode
            4, so all IDE disk I/O is <quote>programmed</quote>). I would
            still suggest putting your swap on a separate drive however.
            The drives are so cheap, it is not worth worrying about.</para>

          <para>Swapping over NFS is only recommended if you do not have a
            local disk to swap to. Swapping over NFS is slow and
            inefficient in FreeBSD releases prior to 4.x, but reasonably
            fast in releases greater or equal to 4.0. Even so, it will be
            limited to the network bandwidth available and puts an
            additional burden on the NFS server.</para>

          <para>The symptom of this is:</para>

ccdconfig: ioctl (CCDIOCSET): /dev/ccd0c: Inappropriate file type or format</screen>

          <para>This usually happens when you are trying to concatenate
            the <literal>c</literal> partitions, which default to type
            <literal>unused</literal>. The ccd driver requires the
            underlying partition type to be FS_BSDFFS. Edit the disklabel

        <answer>
          <para>The symptom of this is:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel ccd0</userinput>
(it prints something sensible here, so let's try to edit it)
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -e ccd0</userinput>
(edit, save, quit)
disklabel: ioctl DIOCWDINFO: No disk label on disk;
use "disklabel -r" to install initial label</screen>

          <para>This is because the disklabel returned by ccd is actually
            a <quote>fake</quote> one that is not really on the disk.
            You can solve this problem by writing it back explicitly,
            as in:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel ccd0 &gt; /tmp/disklabel.tmp</userinput>

        <question id="uucpmail">
          <para>How do I use sendmail for mail delivery with UUCP?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>The sendmail configuration that ships with FreeBSD is
            suited for sites that connect directly to the Internet.
            Sites that wish to exchange their mail via UUCP must install
            another sendmail configuration file.</para>

          <para>Tweaking <filename>/etc/sendmail.cf</filename> manually is
            considered something for purists. Sendmail version 8 comes with
            a new approach of generating config files via some <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?m4">m4</ulink>
            preprocessing, where the actual hand-crafted configuration is
            on a higher abstraction level. You should use the configuration
            files under
            <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf</filename></para>

          <para>If you didn't install your system with full sources,
            the sendmail config stuff has been broken out into a separate
            source distribution tarball just for you. Assuming you've got
            your CD-ROM mounted, do:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /cdrom/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cat scontrib.?? | tar xzf - -C /usr/src contrib/sendmail</userinput></screen>

          <para>Don't panic, this is only a few hundred kilobytes in size.
            The file <filename>README</filename> in the
            <filename>cf</filename> directory can serve as a basic
            introduction to m4 configuration.</para>

          <para>For UUCP delivery, you are best advised to use the
            <literal>mailertable</literal> feature.  This constitutes a
            database that sendmail can use to base its routing decision
            upon.</para>

          <para>First, you have to create your <filename>.mc</filename>
            file.  The directory
            <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</filename> is the
            home of these files.  Look around, there are already a few
            examples.  Assuming you have named your file
            <filename>foo.mc</filename>, all you need to do in order to
            convert it into a valid <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>
            is:</para>

          <screen>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make foo.cf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf</userinput></screen>

          <para>A typical <filename>.mc</filename> file might look
            like:</para>


          <programlisting>include(`../m4/cf.m4')
VERSIONID(`<replaceable>Your version number</replaceable>')
OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

FEATURE(nodns)
FEATURE(nocanonify)
FEATURE(mailertable)

define(`UUCP_RELAY', <replaceable>your.uucp.relay</replaceable>)
define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)

MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
MAILER(uucp)

Cw    <replaceable>your.alias.host.name</replaceable>
Cw    <replaceable>youruucpnodename.UUCP</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>nodns</literal> and
            <literal>nocanonify</literal> features will prevent any usage
            of the DNS during mail delivery.  The
            <literal>UUCP_RELAY</literal> clause is needed for bizarre
            reasons, don't ask.  Simply put an Internet hostname there that
            is able to handle .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely,
            you will enter the mail relay of your ISP there.</para>

          <para>Once you've got this, you need this file called
            <filename>/etc/mailertable</filename>.  A typical example of
            this gender again:</para>

          <programlisting>#
# makemap hash /etc/mailertable.db &lt; /etc/mailertable
#
horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
.interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
.heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1
horus.UUCP                    uucp-dom:horus
if-bus.UUCP                   uucp-dom:if-bus
.                             uucp-dom:</programlisting>


          <para>As you can see, this is part of a real-life file.  The
            first three lines handle special cases where domain-addressed
            mail should not be sent out to the default route, but instead
            to some UUCP neighbor in order to <quote>shortcut</quote> the
            delivery path. The next line handles mail to the local Ethernet
            domain that can be delivered using SMTP. Finally, the UUCP
            neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP pseudo-domain notation, to
            allow for a <literal><replaceable>uucp-neighbor
            </replaceable>!<replaceable>recipient</replaceable></literal>
            override of the default rules. The last line is always a single
            dot, matching everything else, with UUCP delivery to a UUCP
            neighbor that serves as your universal mail gateway to the
            world. All of the node names behind the
            <literal>uucp-dom:</literal> keyword must be valid UUCP
            neighbors, as you can verify using the command
            <literal>uuname</literal>.</para>

          <para>As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a
            DBM database file before being usable, the command line to
            accomplish this is best placed as a comment at the top of
            the mailertable.  You always have to execute this command
            each time you change your mailertable.</para>

          <para>Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular
            mail routing would work, remember the <option>-bt</option>
            option to sendmail. It starts sendmail in <emphasis>address
            test mode</emphasis>; simply enter <literal>0 </literal>,
            followed by the address you wish to test for the mail routing.
            The last line tells you the used internal mail agent, the
            destination host this agent will be called with, and the
            (possibly translated) address. Leave this mode by typing
            Control-D.</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>sendmail -bt</userinput>
ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you've got a statically assigned IP number, you should
            not need to adjust anything from the default.  Set your host
            name up as your assigned internet name and sendmail will do
            the rest.</para>

          <para>If you've got a dynamically assigned IP number and use a
            dialup <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> connection to the
            internet, you will probably be given a mailbox on your ISPs
            mail server. Lets assume your ISPs domain is
            <filename>myISP.com</filename>, and that your user name is
            <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis>. Lets also assume you've
            called your machine <filename>bsd.home</filename> and that your
            ISP has told you that you may use
            <filename>relay.myISP.com</filename> as a mail relay.</para>

          <para>In order to retrieve mail from your mailbox, you'll need
            to install a retrieval agent. <emphasis
            remap=bf>Fetchmail</emphasis> is a good choice as it supports
            many different protocols. Usually, POP3 will be provided by
            your ISP. If you've chosen to use user-ppp, you can
            automatically fetch your mail when a connection to the 'net is
            established with the following entry in
            <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>

          <programlisting>MYADDR:
  !bg su user -c fetchmail</programlisting>

            the command</para>

          <programlisting>  !bg su user -c "sendmail -q"</programlisting>

          <para>after the above shown entry. This forces sendmail to
            process your mailqueue as soon as the connection to the 'net
            is established.</para>

          <para>I'm assuming that you have an account for
            <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis> on

          <para>Needless to say, this file should not be readable by
            anyone except <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis> as it contains

          <para>In order to send mail with the correct
            <emphasis remap=bf>from:</emphasis> header, you must tell
            sendmail to use <email>user@myISP.com</email> rather than
            <email>user@bsd.home</email>. You may also wish to tell
            sendmail to send all mail via
            <filename>relay.myISP.com</filename>, allowing quicker mail
            transmission.</para>

          <para><quote>Sandbox</quote> is a security term.  It can mean
            two things:</para>

          <para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>

                <para>A process which is placed inside a set of virtual
                  walls that are designed to prevent someone who breaks
                  into the process from being able to break into the wider
                  system.</para>

                <para>The process is said to be able to
                  <command>play</command> inside the walls.  That is,
                  nothing the process does in regards to executing code is
                  supposed to be able to breech the walls so you do not
                  have to do a detailed audit of its code to be able to
                  say certain things about its security.</para>

                <para>The walls might be a userid, for example.  This is
                  the definition used in the security and named man
                  pages.</para>

                <para>Take the <literal>ntalk</literal> service, for
                  example (see /etc/inetd.conf). This service used to run
                  as userid root. Now it runs as userid tty. The tty user
                  is a sandbox designed to make it more difficult for
                  someone who has successfully hacked into the system via
                  ntalk from being able to hack beyond that user id.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>A process which is placed inside a simulation of the
                  machine. This is more hard-core. Basically it means that
                  someone who is able to break into the process may believe
                  that he can break into the wider machine but is, in fact,
                  only breaking into a simulation of that machine and not
                  modifying any real data.</para>

                <para>The most common way to accomplish this is to build a
                  simulated environment in a subdirectory and then run the
                  processes in that directory chroot'd (i.e.
                  <filename>/</filename> for that process is this
                  directory, not the real <filename>/</filename> of the
                  system).</para>

                <para>Another common use is to mount an underlying
                  filesystem read-only and then create a filesystem layer
                  on top of it that gives a process a seemingly writeable
                  view into that filesystem. The process may believe it is
                  able to write to those files, but only the process sees
                  the effects - other processes in the system do not,
                  necessarily.</para>

                <para>An attempt is made to make this sort of sandbox so
                  transparent that the user (or hacker) does not realize
                  that he is sitting in it.</para>

          <para>UNIX implements two core sanboxes.  One is at the

          <para>Every UNIX process is completely firewalled off from every
            other UNIX process.  One process can not modify the address
            space of another.  This is unlike Windows where a process
            can easily overwrite the address space of any other, leading
            to a crash.</para>

          <para>A UNIX process is owned by a patricular userid.  If the
            userid is not the root user, it serves to firewall the process
            off from processes owned by other users.  The userid is also
            used to firewall off on-disk data.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Ordinary users can be permitted to mount devices. Here is
            how:</para>

          <procedure>
            <step>
              <para>As <username>root</username> set the sysctl variable
                <varname>vfs.usermount</varname> to

            <step>
              <para>As <username>root</username> assign the appropriate
                permissions to the block device associated with the
                removable media.</para>

              <para>For example, to allow users to mount the first floppy
                drive, use:</para>

              <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 666 /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

              <para>To allow users in the group
                <username>operator</username> to mount the cdrom drive,
                use:</para>

              <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chgrp operator /dev/cd0c</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 640 /dev/cd0c</userinput></screen>
            </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Finally, add the line
		<literal>vfs.usermount=1</literal> to the file
		<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> so that it is reset
		at system boot time.</para>
	    </step>
          </procedure>

          <para>All users can now mount the floppy
            <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> onto a directory that they
            own:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput> mkdir ~/my-mount-point</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput> mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 ~/my-mount-point</userinput></screen>

          <para>Users in group <username>operator</username> can now
            mount the cdrom <filename>/dev/cd0c</filename> onto a
            directory that they own:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput> mkdir ~/my-mount-point</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput> mount -t msdos /dev/cd0c ~/my-mount-point</userinput></screen>

          <para>Unmounting the device is simple:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>umount <filename>~/my-mount-point</filename></userinput></screen>

          <para>Enabling <varname>vfs.usermount</varname>, however, has

        <question>
          <para>How do I move my system over to my huge new disk?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The best way is to reinstall the OS on the new
            disk, then move the user data over.  This is highly
            recommended if you've been tracking -stable for more
            than one release, or have updated a release instead of
            installing a new one.  You can install booteasy on both
            disks with &man.boot0cfg.8;, and dual boot them until
            you are happy with the new configuration.  Skip the
            next paragraph to find out how to move the data after
            doing this.</para>

          <para>Should you decide not to do a fresh install, you
            need to partition and label the new disk with either
            <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>, or &man.fdisk.8;
            and &man.disklabel.8;.  You should also install booteasy
            on both disks with &man.boot0cfg.8;, so that you can
            dual boot to the old or new system after the copying
            is done.  See the <ulink
            url="http://www.freebsd.org/tutorials/formatting-media/index.html">
            formatting-media tutorial</ulink> for details on this
            process.</para>

          <para>Now you've got the new disk set up, and are ready
            to move the data.  Unfortunately, you can't just blindly
            copy the data.  Things like device files (in
            <filename>/dev</filename>) and symbolic links tend to
            screw that up.  You need to use tools that understand
            these things, which means &man.dump.8; and &man.tar.1;.
            I recommend doing the data moves in single user mode,
            but it's not required.</para>

          <para>You should never use anything but &man.dump.8; and
            &man.restore.8; to move the root file system.  The
            &man.tar.1; command may work - then again, it may not.
            You should also use &man.dump.8; and &man.restore.8;
            if you are moving a single partition to another empty
            partition.  The sequence of steps to use dump to move
            a partitions data to a new partition is:</para>

          <procedure>
            <step>
              <para>newfs the new partition.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>mount it on a temporary mount point.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>cd to that directory.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>dump the old partition, piping output to the
                new one.</para>
            </step>
          </procedure>

          <para>For example, if you are going to move root to
            <filename>/dev/ad1s1a</filename>, with
            <filename>/mnt</filename> as the temporary mount point,
            it's:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ad1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ad1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0uaf - / | restore xf -</userinput></screen>


          <para>If you are going to rearrange your partitions -
            say, splitting one into two, or combing two into one,
            you may find yourself needing to move everything under
            a subdirectory to a new location.  Since &man.dump.8;
            works with file systems, it can't do this.  So you use
            &man.tar.1;.  The general command to move
            <filename>/old</filename> to <filename>/new</filename>
            for &man.tar.1; is:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /old; tar cf - .) | (cd /new; tar xpf -)</userinput></screen>

          <para>If <filename>/old</filename> has file systems
            mounted on that, and you
            don't want to move that data or unmount them, you just
            add the 'l' flag to the first &man.tar.1;:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /old; tar clf - .) | (cd /new; tar xpf -).</userinput></screen>

          <para>You might prefer cpio(1), pax(1) or cpdup

          <para>Yes.  But you need to customize X client programs. See <ulink

              <para>Translate the Wheel Events</para>

              <para>The <application>imwheel</application> program
                works by translating mouse button 4 and mouse button 5
                events into key events.  Thus, you have to get the
                mouse driver to translate mouse wheel events to button
                4 and 5 events.  There are two ways of doing this, the
                first way is to have &man.moused.8; do the
                translation.  The second way is for the X server
                itself to do the event translation.</para>

                  <para>To have &man.moused.8; perform the event
                    translations, simply add <option>-z 4</option> to
                    the command line used to start &man.moused.8;.
                    For example, if you normally start &man.moused.8;
                    via <command>moused -p /dev/psm0</command> you
                    would start it by entering <command>moused -p
                    /dev/psm0 -z 4</command> instead.  If you start
                    &man.moused.8; automatically during bootup via
                    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, you can simply
                    add <option>-z 4</option> to the
                    <varname>moused_flags</varname> variable in
                    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

                  <para>You now need to tell X that you have a 5
                    button mouse.  To do this, simply add the line

                    Events</para>

                  <para>If you aren't running &man.moused.8;, or if
                    you don't want &man.moused.8; to translate your
                    wheel events, you can have the X server do the
                    event translation instead.  This requires a couple
                    of modifications to your
                    <filename>/etc/XF86Config</filename> file.  First,
                    you need to choose the proper protocol for your
                    mouse.  Most wheeled mice use the
                    <quote>IntelliMouse</quote> protocol.  However,
                    XFree86 does support other protocols, such as
                    <quote>MouseManPlusPS/2</quote> for the Logitech
                    MouseMan+ mice.  Once you have chosen the protocol
                    you will use, you need to add a
                    <varname>Protocol</varname> line to the
                    <quote>Pointer</quote> section.</para>

                  <para>Secondly, you need to tell the X server to
                    remap wheel scroll events to mouse buttons 4 and
                    5.  This is done with the
                    <varname>ZAxisMapping</varname> option.</para>

                  <para>For example, if you aren't using

          <para>What is a virtual console and how do I make more?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Virtual consoles, put simply, enable you to have several
            simultaneous sessions on the same machine without doing anything
            complicated like setting up a network or running X.</para>

          <para>When the system starts, it will display a login prompt on
            the monitor after displaying all the boot messages. You can
            then type in your login name and password and start working (or
            playing!) on the first virtual console.</para>

          <para>At some point, you will probably wish to start another
            session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program
            you are running or to read your mail while waiting for an
            FTP transfer to finish. Just do Alt-F2 (hold down the Alt
            key and press the F2 key), and you will find a login prompt
            waiting for you on the second <quote>virtual console</quote>!
            When you want to go back to the original session, do
            Alt-F1.</para>

          <para>The default FreeBSD installation has three virtual consoles
            enabled (8 starting with 3.3-RELEASE), and Alt-F1, Alt-F2, and
            Alt-F3 will switch between these virtual consoles.</para>

          <para>To enable more of them, edit <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink>
            and add entries for <devicename>ttyv4</devicename>
            to <devicename>ttyvc</devicename> after the comment on
            <quote>Virtual terminals</quote>:</para>

          <programlisting># Edit the existing entry for ttyv3 in /etc/ttys and change

          <para>Use as many or as few as you want.  The more virtual
            terminals you have, the more resources that are used; this
            can be important if you have 8MB RAM or less.  You may also

                say that if you want to have a login prompt pop up for all
                twelve of your Alt-function keys, you're out of luck - you

          <para>The easiest way to disable a console is by turning it off.
            For example, if you had the full 12 terminal allocation

          <para>Next, the easiest (and cleanest) way to activate the
            virtual consoles is to reboot.  However, if you really don't
            want to reboot, you can just shut down the X Window system
            and execute (as <username>root</username>):</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kill -HUP 1</userinput></screen>

          <para>It's imperative that you completely shut down X Window if
            it is running, before running this command.  If you don't,
            your system will probably appear to hang/lock up after

          <para>The ttys method has the advantage of documenting which
            vty X will start on and passing the responsibility of
            restarting the X server on logout to init.  The rc.local
            method makes it easy to kill xdm if there is a problem
            starting the X server. </para>

          <para>If loaded from rc.local, <command>xdm</command> should
            be started without any arguments (i.e., as a daemon). xdm must
            start AFTER getty runs, or else getty and xdm will conflict,
            locking out the console. The best way around this is to have
            the script sleep 10 seconds or so then launch xdm.</para>

          <para>If you are to start <command>xdm</command> from

          <programlisting>:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X vt4</programlisting>

          <para>The above example will direct the X server to run in
            <filename>/dev/ttyv3</filename>. Note the number is offset by
            one. The X server counts the vty from one, whereas the FreeBSD

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Your mouse and the mouse driver may have somewhat become
            out of synchronization.</para>

          <para>In versions 2.2.5 and earlier, switching away from X to a
            virtual terminal and getting back to X again may make them
            re-synchronized.  If the problem occurs often, you may add the
            following option in your kernel configuration file and
            recompile it.</para>

          <programlisting>options PSM_CHECKSYNC</programlisting>

          <para>See the section on <link linkend="make-kernel">building
            a kernel</link> if you've no experience with building
            kernels.</para>

          <para>With this option, there should be less chance of
            synchronization problem between the mouse and the driver.
            If, however, you still see the problem, click any mouse
            button while holding the mouse still to re-synchronize the
            mouse and the driver.</para>

          <para>Note that unfortunately this option may not work with all
            the systems and voids the <quote>tap</quote> feature of the
            ALPS GlidePoint device attached to the PS/2 mouse port.</para>

          <para>In versions 2.2.6 and later, synchronization check is done
            in a slightly better way and is standard in the PS/2 mouse
            driver. It should even work with GlidePoint. (As the check code
            has become a standard feature, PSM_CHECKSYNC option is not
            available in these versions.) However, in rare case the driver
            may erroneously report synchronization problem and you may see
            the kernel message:</para>

          <programlisting>psmintr: out of sync (xxxx != yyyy)</programlisting>

          <para>and find your mouse doesn't seem to work properly.</para>

          <para>If this happens, disable the synchronization check code
            by setting the driver flags for the PS/2 mouse driver to 0x100.

          <para>How do I install a splash screen and where do I find
            them?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>Just prior to the release of FreeBSD 3.1, a new feature
            was added to allow the display of <quote>splash</quote> screens
            during the boot messages. The splash screens currently must be
            a 256 color bitmap (<filename>*.BMP</filename>) or ZSoft PCX
            (<filename>*.PCX</filename>) file. In addition, they must have
            a resolution of 320x200 or less to work on standard VGA
            adapters. If you compile VESA support into your kernel, then
            you can use larger bitmaps up to 1024x768. Note that VESA
            support requires the <literal>VM86</literal> kernel option to
            be compiled into the kernel. The actual VESA support can either
            be compiled directly into the kernel with the
            <literal>VESA</literal> kernel config option or by loading the
            VESA kld module during bootup.</para>

          <para>To use a splash screen, you need to modify the startup
            files that control the boot process for FreeBSD. The files for
            this changed prior to the release of FreeBSD 3.2, so there are
            now two ways of loading a splash screen:</para>

          <para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>FreeBSD 3.1</para>

                <para>The first step is to find a bitmap version of your
                  splash screen. Release 3.1 only supports Windows bitmap
                  splash screens. Once you've found your splash screen of
                  choice copy it to <filename>/boot/splash.bmp</filename>.
                  Next, you need to have a
                  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> file that contains
                  the following lines:</para>

                <programlisting>load kernel
load -t splash_image_data /boot/splash.bmp
load splash_bmp
autoboot</programlisting>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>FreeBSD 3.2+</para>

                <para>In addition to adding support for PCX splash screens,
                  FreeBSD 3.2 includes a nicer way of configuring the boot
                  process. If you wish, you can use the method listed above
                  for FreeBSD 3.1. If you do and you want to use PCX,
                  replace <literal>splash_bmp</literal> with
                  <literal>splash_pcx</literal>. If, on the other hand, you
                  want to use the newer boot configuration, you need to
                  create a <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> file that
                  contains the following lines:</para>

                <programlisting>include /boot/loader.4th
start</programlisting>

                <para>and a <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> that
                  contains the following:</para>

                <programlisting>splash_bmp_load="YES"
bitmap_load="YES"</programlisting>

                <para>This assumes you are using
                  <filename>/boot/splash.bmp</filename> for your splash
                  screen.  If you'd rather use a PCX file, copy it to
                  <filename>/boot/splash.pcx</filename>, create a
                  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> as instructed
                  above, and create a
                  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> that
                  contains:</para>

                <programlisting>splash_pcx_load="YES"
bitmap_load="YES"
bitmap_name="/boot/splash.pcx"</programlisting>

              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

            to tell other systems on your network about your router;
            FreeBSD comes with the standard BSD routing daemon <ulink

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Typically, people who ask this question have two PC's
            at home, one with FreeBSD and one with Win95; the idea is to
            use the FreeBSD box to connect to the Internet and then be able
            to access the Internet from the Windows95 box through the
            FreeBSD box. This is really just a special case of the previous
            question.</para> <para> ... and the answer is yes! In FreeBSD
            3.x, user-mode ppp contains a <option>-nat</option> option. If
            you run <command>ppp</command> with the <option>-nat</option>,
            set <literal>gateway_enable</literal> to
            <emphasis>YES</emphasis> in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
            and configure your Windows machine correctly, this should work
            fine.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>You will probably find that the host is actually in a
            different domain; for example, if you are in foo.bar.edu and
            you wish to reach a host called <hostid>mumble</hostid> in the
            <hostid role="domainname">bar.edu</hostid> domain, you will
            have to refer to it by the fully-qualified domain name, <hostid
            role="fqdn">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>, instead of just
            <hostid>mumble</hostid>.</para>

          <para>Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers.
            However the current version of <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?named">bind</ulink>
            that ships with FreeBSD no longer provides default
            abbreviations for non-fully qualified domain names other than
            the domain you are in. So an unqualified host
            <hostid>mumble</hostid> must either be found as <hostid
            role="fqdn">mumble.foo.bar.edu</hostid>, or it will be searched
            for in the root domain.</para>

          <para>This is different from the previous behavior, where the
            search continued across
            <hostid role="fqdn">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>, and
            <hostid role="domainname">mumble.edu</hostid>.  Have a look at
            RFC 1535 for why this was considered bad practice, or even a
            security hole.</para>

          <para>As a good workaround, you can place the line</para>

          <programlisting>search foo.bar.edu bar.edu</programlisting>

          <para>instead of the previous</para>

            search order does not go beyond the <quote>boundary between

        <question>
          <para>How much overhead does IPFW incur?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The answer to this depends mostly on your rule set and
            processor speed. For most applications dealing with ethernet
            and small rule sets, the answer is, negligible. For those of
            you that need actual measurements to satisfy your curiosity,
            read on.</para>

          <para>The following measurements were made using 2.2.5-STABLE
            on a 486-66.  IPFW was modified to measure the time spent
            within the <literal>ip_fw_chk</literal> routine, displaying
            the results to the console every 1000 packets.</para>

          <para>Two rule sets, each with 1000 rules were tested.  The
            first set was designed to demonstrate a worst case scenario
            by repeating the rule:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ipfw add deny tcp from any to any 55555</userinput></screen>

          <para>This demonstrates worst case by causing most of IPFW's
            packet check routine to be executed before finally deciding
            that the packet does not match the rule (by virtue of the port
            number). Following the 999th iteration of this rule was an
            <literal>allow ip from any to any</literal>.</para>

          <para>The second set of rules were designed to abort the rule
            check quickly:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ipfw add deny ip from 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.4</userinput></screen>

          <para>The nonmatching source IP address for the above rule causes
            these rules to be skipped very quickly.  As before, the 1000th
            rule was an <literal>allow ip from any to any</literal>.</para>

          <para>The per-packet processing overhead in the former case was
            approximately 2.703ms/packet, or roughly 2.7 microseconds per
            rule. Thus the theoretical packet processing limit with these
            rules is around 370 packets per second. Assuming 10Mbps
            ethernet and a ~1500 byte packet size, we would only be able to
            achieve a 55.5% bandwidth utilization.</para>

          <para>For the latter case each packet was processed in
            approximately 1.172ms, or roughly 1.2 microseconds per rule.
            The theoretical packet processing limit here would be about
            853 packets per second, which could consume 10Mbps ethernet
            bandwidth.</para>

          <para>The excessive number of rules tested and the nature of
            those rules do not provide a real-world scenario -- they were
            used only to generate the timing information presented here.

        <answer>
          <para>First, check that you've got a default route.  By running
            <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?netstat">
            netstat -rn</ulink>, you should see two entries like this:</para>

          <para>This is assuming that you've used the addresses from the
            handbook, the man page or from the ppp.conf.sample file.
            If you haven't got a default route, it may be because you're
            running an old version of <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ppp">ppp</ulink>
            that doesn't understand the word <literal>HISADDR</literal>
            in the ppp.conf file.  If your version of
            <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> is from before FreeBSD
            2.2.5, change the</para>

          <para>line to one saying</para>


          <programlisting>add 0 0 10.0.0.2</programlisting>

          <para>Another reason for the default route line being missing
            is that you have mistakenly set up a default router in your

        <answer>
          <para>Sometimes, on a noisy phone line or even on a line with

            thinks (incorrectly) that it lost carrier.</para>

          <para>There's a setting on most modems for determining how
            tolerant it should be to temporary losses of carrier.  On a
            USR Sportster for example, this is measured by the S10
            register in tenths of a second.  To make your modem more
            forgiving, you could add the following send-expect sequence
            to your dial string:</para>

          <programlisting>set dial "...... ATS10=10 OK ......"</programlisting>

        <question>
          <para>My connection hangs after a random amount of time</para>
        </question><answer>

          <para>Many people experience hung connections with no apparent
            explaination.  The first thing to establish is which side of
            the link is hung.</para>

          <para>If you are using an external modem, you can simply try
            using <command>ping</command> to see if the
            <acronym>TD</acronym> light is flashing when you transmit data.
            If it flashes (and the <acronym>RD</acronym> light doesn't),
            the problem is with the remote end. If <acronym>TD</acronym>
            doesn't flash, the problem is local. With an internal modem,
            you'll need to use the <literal>set server</literal> command in
            your <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file. When the hang occurs,
            connect to ppp using pppctl. If your network connection
            suddenly revives (ppp was revived due to the activity on the
            diagnostic socket) or if you can't connect (assuming the
            <literal>set socket</literal> command succeeded at startup
            time), the problem is local. If you can connect and things are
            still hung, enable local async logging with <literal>set log
            local async</literal> and use <command>ping</command> from
            another window or terminal to make use of the link. The async
            logging will show you the data being transmitted and received
            on the link. If data is going out and not coming back, the
            problem is remote.</para>

          <para>Having established whether the problem is local or remote,
            you now have two possibilities:</para>

        <question>
          <para>The remote end isn't responding</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>There's very little you can do about this.  Most ISPs
            will refuse to help if you're not running a Microsoft OS.
            You can <literal>enable lqr</literal> in your
            <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file, allowing ppp to detect
            the remote failure and hang up, but this detection is
            relatively slow and therefore not that useful.  You may want to
            avoid telling your ISP that you're running user-ppp....</para>

          <para>First, try disabling all local compression by adding the
            following to your configuration:</para>

          <programlisting>disable pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
deny pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj</programlisting>

          <para>Then reconnect to ensure that this makes no difference.
            If things improve or if the problem is solved completely,
            determine which setting makes the difference through trial
            and error.  This will provide good amunition when you contact
            your ISP (although it may make it apparent that you're not
            running a Microsoft product).</para>

          <para>Before contacting your ISP, enable async logging locally
            and wait until the connection hangs again.  This may use up
            quite a bit of disk space.  The last data read from the port
            may be of interest.  It is usually ascii data, and may even
            describe the problem
            (<quote>Memory fault, core dumped</quote> ?).</para>

          <para>If your ISP is helpful, they should be able to enable
            logging on their end, then when the next link drop occurs,
            they may be able to tell you why their side is having a
            problem.  Feel free to send the details to &a.brian;, or

        <question>
          <para>I keep seeing errors about magic being the same</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Occasionally, just after connecting, you may see messages
            in the log that say <quote>magic is the same</quote>.
            Sometimes, these messages are harmless, and sometimes one side
            or the other exits.  Most ppp implementations cannot survive
            this problem, and even if the link seems to come up, you'll see
            repeated configure requests and configure acknowledgements in
            the log file until ppp eventually gives up and closes the
          connection.</para>

          <para>This normally happens on server machines with slow disks
            that are spawning a getty on the port, and executing ppp from
            a login script or program after login.  I've also heard reports
            of it happening consistently when using slirp.  The reason is
            that in the time taken between getty exiting and ppp starting,
            the client-side ppp starts sending Line Control Protocol (LCP)
            packets.  Because ECHO is still switched on for the port on
            the server, the client ppp sees these packets
            <quote>reflect</quote> back.</para>

          <para>One part of the LCP negotiation is to establish a magic
            number for each side of the link so that
            <quote>reflections</quote> can be detected. The protocol says
            that when the peer tries to negotiate the same magic number, a
            NAK should be sent and a new magic number should be chosen.
            During the period that the server port has ECHO turned on, the
            client ppp sends LCP packets, sees the same magic in the
            reflected packet and NAKs it. It also sees the NAK reflect
            (which also means ppp must change its magic). This produces a
            potentially enormous number of magic number changes, all of
            which are happily piling into the server's tty buffer. As soon
            as ppp starts on the server, it's flooded with magic number
            changes and almost immediately decides it's tried enough to
            negotiate LCP and gives up. Meanwhile, the client, who no
            longer sees the reflections, becomes happy just in time to see
            a hangup from the server.</para>

          <para>This can be avoided by allowing the peer to start
            negotiating with the following line in your ppp.conf
            file:</para>

          <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

          <para>This tells ppp to wait for the server to initiate LCP
            negotiations.  Some servers however may never initiate
            negotiations.  If this is the case, you can do something
            like:</para>

          <programlisting>set openmode active 3</programlisting>

          <para>This tells ppp to be passive for 3 seconds, and then to
            start sending LCP requests.  If the peer starts sending
          requests during this period, ppp will immediately respond
          rather than waiting for the full 3 second period.</para>

          <para>LCP negotiations continue 'till the connection is
            closed</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>There is currently an implementation mis-feature in
            <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> where it doesn't associate
            LCP, CCP &amp; IPCP responses with their original requests. As
            a result, if one <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>
            implementation is more than 6 seconds slower than the other
            side, the other side will send two additional LCP configuration
            requests. This is fatal.</para>

          <para>Consider two implementations,
            <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> and <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis>. <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> starts
            sending LCP requests immediately after connecting and <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> takes 7 seconds to start. When <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> starts, <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis>
            has sent 3 LCP REQs. We're assuming the line has ECHO switched
            off, otherwise we'd see magic number problems as described in
            the previous section. <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> sends a
            REQ, then an ACK to the first of <emphasis
            remap=bf>A</emphasis>'s REQs. This results in <emphasis
            remap=bf>A</emphasis> entering the <acronym>OPENED</acronym>
            state and sending and ACK (the first) back to <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis>. In the meantime, <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> sends back two more ACKs in response to
            the two additional REQs sent by <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis>
            before <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> started up. <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> then receives the first ACK from
            <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> and enters the
            <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state. <emphasis
            remap=bf>A</emphasis> receives the second ACK from <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> and goes back to the <emphasis
            remap=bf>REQ-SENT</emphasis> state, sending another (forth) REQ
            as per the RFC. It then receives the third ACK and enters the
            <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state. In the meantime, <emphasis
            remap=bf>B</emphasis> receives the forth REQ from <emphasis
            remap=bf>A</emphasis>, resulting in it reverting to the
            <emphasis remap=bf>ACK-SENT</emphasis> state and sending
            another (second) REQ and (forth) ACK as per the RFC. <emphasis
            remap=bf>A</emphasis> gets the REQ, goes into <emphasis
            remap=bf>REQ-SENT</emphasis> and sends another REQ. It
            immediately receives the following ACK and enters
            <acronym>OPENED</acronym>.</para>

          <para>This goes on 'till one side figures out that they're
            getting nowhere and gives up.</para>

          <para>The best way to avoid this is to configure one side to be
            <emphasis remap=bf>passive</emphasis> - that is, make one side

          <para>command (where <emphasis remap=bf>N</emphasis> is the

        </question><answer>

          <para>If <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> is dialing
            unexpectedly, you must determine the cause, and set up Dial
            filters (dfilters) to prevent such dialing.</para>

          <para>To determine the cause, use the following line:</para>

          <programlisting>set log +tcp/ip</programlisting>

          <para>This will log all traffic through the connection.  The
            next time the line comes up unexpectedly, you will see the
            reason logged with a convenient timestamp next to it.</para>

          <para>You can now disable dialing under these circumstances.
            Usually, this sort of problem arises due to DNS lookups.  To
            prevent DNS lookups from establishing a connection (this will
            <emphasis remap=bf>not</emphasis> prevent
            <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> from passing the packets
            through an established connection), use the following:</para>

          <programlisting>set dfilter 1 deny udp src eq 53
set dfilter 2 deny udp dst eq 53
set dfilter 3 permit 0/0 0/0</programlisting>

          <para>This is not always suitable, as it will effectively break

            lookup before doing any other network related things.</para>

          <para>Ppp (or any other program for that matter) should never

            <emphasis remap=bf>is</emphasis> actually termating due to a
            segmentation violation or some other signal that normally
            causes core to be dumped, <emphasis remap=bf>and</emphasis>
            you're sure you're using the latest version (see the start of

&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 555 /usr/sbin/ppp</userinput></screen>

          <para>You will now have a debuggable version of ppp installed.

          <para>The process that forces a dial in auto mode never
            connects</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This was a known problem with
            <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> set up to negotiate a
            dynamic local IP number with the peer in auto mode.  It is
            fixed in the latest version - search the man page for
            <emphasis remap=bf>iface</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>The problem was that when that initial program calls
            <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?connect">
            connect(2)</ulink>, the IP number of the tun interface is
            assigned to the socket endpoint. The kernel creates the first
            outgoing packet and writes it to the tun device. <emphasis
            remap=bf>Ppp</emphasis> then reads the packet and establishes a
            connection. If, as a result of <emphasis
            remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>s dynamic IP assignment, the interface
            address is changed, the original socket endpoint will be
            invalid. Any subsequent packets sent to the peer will usually
            be dropped. Even if they aren't, any responses will not route
            back to the originating machine as the IP number is no longer
            owned by that machine.</para>

          <para>There are several theoretical ways to approach this
            problem. It would be nicest if the peer would re-assign the
            same IP number if possible <emphasis remap=tt>:-)</emphasis>
            The current version of <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> does
            this, but most other implementations don't.</para>

          <para>The easiest method from our side would be to never change
            the tun interface IP number, but instead to change all outgoing
            packets so that the source IP number is changed from the
            interface IP to the negotiated IP on the fly. This is
            essentially what the <literal>iface-alias</literal> option in
            the latest version of <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> is
            doing (with the help of <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?libalias">
            libalias(3)</ulink> and ppp's <option>-nat</option> switch) -
            it's maintaining all previous interface addresses and NATing
            them to the last negotiated address.</para>

          <para>Another alternative (and probably the most reliable) would
            be to implement a system call that changes all bound sockets
            from one IP to another. <emphasis remap=bf>Ppp</emphasis> would
            use this call to modify the sockets of all existing programs
            when a new IP number is negotiated. The same system call could
            be used by dhcp clients when they are forced to re-bind() their
            sockets.</para>

          <para>Yet another possibility is to allow an interface to be
            brought up without an IP number. Outgoing packets would be
            given an IP number of 255.255.255.255 up until the first
            SIOCAIFADDR ioctl is done. This would result in fully binding
            the socket. It would be up to <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>
            to change the source IP number, but only if it's set to
            255.255.255.255, and only the IP number and IP checksum would
            need to change. This, however is a bit of a hack as the kernel
            would be sending bad packets to an improperly configured
            interface, on the assumption that some other mechanism is
            capable of fixing things retrospectively.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Why don't most games work with the -nat switch</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The reason games and the like don't work when libalias
            is in use is that the machine on the outside will try to open a
            connection or send (unsolicited) UDP packets to the machine on
            the inside. The NAT software doesn't know that it should send
            these packets to the interior machine.</para>

          <para>To make things work, make sure that the only thing
            running is the software that you're having problems with, then
            either run tcpdump on the tun interface of the gateway or
            enable ppp tcp/ip logging (<literal>set log +tcp/ip</literal>)
            on the gateway.</para>

          <para>When you start the offending software, you should see
            packets passing through the gateway machine. When something
            comes back from the outside, it'll be dropped (that's the
            problem). Note the port number of these packets then shut down
            the offending software. Do this a few times to see if the port
            numbers are consistent. If they are, then the following line in
            the relevant section of /etc/ppp/ppp.conf will make the
            software functional:</para>

          <programlisting>nat port <replaceable>proto</replaceable> <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable> <replaceable>port</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>where <replaceable>proto</replaceable> is either
            <literal>tcp</literal> or <literal>udp</literal>,
            <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable> is the machine that
            you want the packets to be sent to and
            <replaceable>port</replaceable> is the destination port number
            of the packets.</para>

          <para>You won't be able to use the software on other machines
            without changing the above command, and running the software
            on two internal machines at the same time is out of the question
            - after all, the outside world is seeing your entire internal
            network as being just a single machine.</para>

          <para>If the port numbers aren't consistent, there are three
            more options:</para>

          <para><emphasis remap=bf>1)</emphasis> Submit support in
            libalias. Examples of <quote>special cases</quote> can be found
            in <filename>/usr/src/lib/libalias/alias_*.c</filename>
            (<filename>alias_ftp.c</filename> is a good prototype). This
            usually involves reading certain recognised outgoing packets,
            identifying the instruction that tells the outside machine to
            initiate a connection back to the internal machine on a
            specific (random) port and setting up a <quote>route</quote> in
            the alias table so that the subsequent packets know where to
            go.</para>

          <para>This is the most difficult solution, but it is the best
            and will make the software work with multiple machines.</para>

          <para><emphasis remap=bf>2)</emphasis> Use a proxy.  The

            option that avoids ever requesting that the peer open
            connections back to the local machine.</para>

          <para>What are FCS errors ?</para>

          <para>FCS stands for <emphasis remap=bf>F</emphasis>rame
            <emphasis remap=bf>C</emphasis>heck
            <emphasis remap=bf>S</emphasis>equence.  Each ppp packet
            has a checksum attached to ensure that the data being
            received is the data being sent.  If the FCS of an incoming
            packet is incorrect, the packet is dropped and the HDLC FCS
            count is increased.  The HDLC error values can be displayed
            using the <literal>show hdlc</literal> command.</para>

          <para>If your link is bad (or if your serial driver is dropping
            packets), you will see the occasional FCS error.  This is not
            usually worth worrying about although it does slow down the
            compression protocols substantially.  If you have an external
            modem, make sure your cable is properly shielded from
            interference - this may eradicate the problem.</para>

          <para>If your link freezes as soon as you've connected and you
            see a large number of FCS errors, this may be because your link
            is not 8 bit clean. Make sure your modem is not using software
            flow control (XON/XOFF). If your datalink
            <emphasis>must</emphasis> use software flow control, use the
            command <literal>set accmap 0x000a0000</literal> to tell
            <command>ppp</command> to escape the <literal>^Q</literal> and
            <literal>^S</literal> characters.</para>

          <para>Another reason for seeing too many FCS errors may be that
            the remote end has stopped talking <acronym>PPP</acronym>. You
            may want to enable <literal>async</literal> logging at this
            point to determine if the incoming data is actually a login or
            shell prompt. If you have a shell prompt at the remote end,
            it's possible to terminate ppp without dropping the line by
            using the <literal>close lcp</literal> command (a following
            <literal>term</literal> command will reconnect you to the shell
            on the remote machine.</para>

          <para>If nothing in your log file indicates why the link might

        <answer>
          <para>As the FreeBSD kernel boots, it will probe for the serial
            ports in your system for which the kernel was configured.
            You can either watch your system closely for the messages it
            prints or run the command</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>dmesg | grep sio</userinput></screen>

          <para>after your system's up and running.</para>

          <para>Here's some example output from the above command:</para>

          <programlisting>sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
sio0: type 16550A
sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
sio1: type 16550A</programlisting>

          <para>This shows two serial ports.  The first is on irq 4, is
            using port address <literal>0x3f8</literal>, and has a
            16550A-type UART chip.  The second uses the same kind of chip
            but is on irq 3 and is at port address <literal>0x2f8</literal>.
            Internal modem cards are treated just like serial ports---except
            that they always have a modem <quote>attached</quote> to the
            port.</para>

          <para>The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel includes support
            for two serial ports using the same irq and port address
            settings in the above example.  If these settings aren't
            right for your system, or if you've added modem cards or have
            more serial ports than your kernel is configured for, just
            reconfigure your kernel.  See section
            <link linkend="make-kernel">about building a kernel</link> for

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The third serial port, <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio">sio2</ulink>
            (known as COM3 in DOS), is on <filename>/dev/cuaa2</filename>
            for dial-out devices, and on <filename>/dev/ttyd2</filename>
            for dial-in devices.  What's the difference between these two
            classes of devices?</para>

          <para>You use <filename>ttydX</filename> for dial-ins.  When
            opening <filename>/dev/ttydX</filename> in blocking mode, a
            process will wait for the corresponding
            <filename>cuaaX</filename> device to become inactive, and then
            wait for the carrier detect line to go active.  When you open
            the <filename>cuaaX</filename> device, it makes sure the serial
            port isn't already in use by the <filename>ttydX</filename>
            device. If the port's available, it <quote>steals</quote> it
            from the <filename>ttydX</filename> device. Also, the
            <filename>cuaXX</filename> device doesn't care about carrier
            detect. With this scheme and an auto-answer modem, you can have
            remote users log in and you can still dialout with the same
            modem and the system will take care of all the
            conflicts.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Again, the section on kernel configuration provides
            information about configuring your kernel. For a multiport
            serial card, place an <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio">sio</ulink> line
            for each serial port on the card in the kernel configuration
            file. But place the irq and vector specifiers on only one of
            the entries. All of the ports on the card should share one irq.
            For consistency, use the last serial port to specify the irq.
            Also, specify the <literal>COM_MULTIPORT</literal>
            option.</para>

          <para>The following example is for an AST 4-port serial card on
            irq 7:</para>

          <programlisting>options "COM_MULTIPORT"
device sio4 at isa? port 0x2a0 tty flags 0x781
device sio5 at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x781
device sio6 at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x781
device sio7 at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x781 irq 7 vector siointr</programlisting>

          <para>The flags indicate that the master port has minor number 7
            (<literal>0x700</literal>), diagnostics enabled during probe
            (<literal>0x080</literal>), and all the ports share an irq

          <para>Can I set the default serial parameters for a

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The <filename>ttydX</filename> (or
            <filename>cuaaX</filename>) device is the regular device
            you'll want to open for your applications.  When a process
            opens the device, it'll have a default set of terminal I/O
            settings. You can see these settings with the command</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1</userinput></screen>

          <para>When you change the settings to this device, the settings
            are in effect until the device is closed.  When it's reopened,
            it goes back to the default set.  To make changes to the
            default set, you can open and adjust the settings of the
            <quote>initial state</quote> device. For example, to turn on
            <acronym>CLOCAL</acronym> mode, 8 bits, and
            <filename>XON/XOFF</filename> flow control by default for
            ttyd5, do:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff</userinput></screen>

          <para>A good place to do this is in
            <filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename>. Now, an application will
            have these settings by default when it opens
            <filename>ttyd5</filename>.  It can still change these settings
            to its liking, though.</para>

          <para>You can also prevent certain settings from being changed
            by an application by making adjustments to the
            <quote>lock state</quote> device.  For example, to lock the
            speed of <filename>ttyd5</filename> to 57600 bps, do</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600</userinput></screen>

          <para>Now, an application that opens <filename>ttyd5</filename>
            and tries to change the speed of the port will be stuck with
          57600 bps.</para>

          <para>Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state
            devices writable only by <username>root</username>. The <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</ulink>

        <question>
          <para>How can I enable dialup logins on my modem?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>So you want to become an Internet service provider, eh?
            First, you'll need one or more modems that can auto-answer.
            Your modem will need to assert carrier-detect when it detects a
            carrier and not assert it all the time. It will need to hang up
            the phone and reset itself when the data terminal ready
            (<acronym>DTR</acronym>) line goes from on to off. It should
            probably use <filename>RTS/CTS</filename> flow control or no
            local flow control at all. Finally, it must use a constant
            speed between the computer and itself, but (to be nice to your
            callers) it should negotiate a speed between itself and the
            remote modem.</para>

          <para>For many Hayes command-set--compatible modems, this
            command will make these settings and store them in
            nonvolatile memory:</para>

          <programlisting>AT &amp;C1 &amp;D3 &amp;K3 &amp;Q6 S0=1 &amp;W</programlisting>

          <para>See the section <link linkend="direct-at">on sending AT
            commands</link> below for information on how to make these
            settings without resorting to an MS-DOS terminal program.</para>

          <para>Next, make an entry in <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">
            /etc/ttys</ulink> for the modem.  This file lists all the ports
            on which the operating system will await logins.  Add a line
            that looks something like this:</para>

          <programlisting>ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.57600" dialup on insecure</programlisting>

          <para>This line indicates that the second serial port
            (<filename>/dev/ttyd1</filename>) has a modem connected
            running at 57600 bps and no parity
            (<literal>std.57600</literal>, which comes from the file <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?gettytab">/etc/gettytab</ulink>).
            The terminal type for this port is <literal>dialup</literal>.
            The port is <literal>on</literal> and is
            <literal>insecure</literal>---meaning root logins on the port
            aren't allowed. For dialin ports like this one, use the
            <literal>ttydX</literal> entry.</para>

          <para>It's common practice to use <literal>dialup</literal> as
            the terminal type. Many users set up in their .profile or
            .login files a prompt for the actual terminal type if the
            starting type is dialup. The example shows the port as
            insecure. To become root on this port, you have to login as a
            regular user, then <command>su</command> to become
            <username>root</username>. If you use <literal>secure</literal>
            then <username>root</username> can login in directly.</para>

          <para>After making modifications to <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">
            /etc/ttys</ulink>, you need to send a hangup or
            <acronym>HUP</acronym> signal to the <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?init">
            init</ulink> process:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kill -HUP 1</userinput></screen>

          <para>This forces the init process to reread <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">
            /etc/ttys</ulink>.  The init process will then start getty
            processes on all <literal>on</literal> ports.  You can find
            out if logins are available for your port by typing</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ps -ax | grep '[t]tyd1'</userinput></screen>

          <para>You should see something like:</para>

          <para>CTRL+P is the default <quote>force</quote> character,

            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip">tip</ulink>
            that the next character is literal data.  You can set the
            force character to any other character with the
            <literal>~s</literal> escape, which means <quote>set a
            variable</quote>.</para>

          <para>Type <literal>~sforce=<replaceable>single-char
            </replaceable></literal> followed by a newline.
            <replaceable>single-char</replaceable> is any single character.
            If you leave out <replaceable>single-char</replaceable>,
            then the force character is the nul character, which you can
            get by typing CTRL+2 or CTRL+SPACE.  A pretty good value for

        <question>
          <para>FreeBSD uses far more swap space than Linux. Why?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>FreeBSD only appears to use more swap than Linux.  In
            actual fact, it does not. The main difference between FreeBSD
            and Linux in this regard is that FreeBSD will proactively move
            entirely idle, unused pages of main memory into swap in order
            to make more main memory available for active use. Linux tends
            to only move pages to swap as a last resort. The perceived
            heavier use of swap is balanced by the more efficient use of
            main memory. </para>

          <para>Note that while FreeBSD is proactive in this regard, it
            does not arbitrarily decide to swap pages when the system is
            truely idle.  Thus you will not find your system all paged
            out when you get up in the morning after leaving it idle
            overnight.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Why does &man.top.1; show very little free memory even
            when I have very few programs running?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>The simple answer is that free memory is wasted
            memory.  Any memory that your programs don't actively
            allocate is used within the FreeBSD kernel as disk
            cache.  The values shown by &man.top.1; labelled as
            <literal>Inact</literal>, <literal>Cache</literal>, and
            <literal>Buf</literal> are all cached data at different
            aging levels.  This cached data means the system does
            not have to access a slow disk again for data it has
            accessed recently, thus increasing overall performance.
            In general, a low value shown for <literal>Free</literal>
            memory in &man.top.1; is good, provided it is not
            <emphasis>very</emphasis> low.</para>

                  designed with the assumption that there would be only
                  one ABI per system architecture.  That assumption is
                  actually quite incorrect, and not even in the
                  commercial SYSV world (which has at least three ABIs:
                  SVR4, Solaris, SCO) does it hold true.</para>

          <para>FreeBSD comes from the <quote>classic</quote> camp and has
            traditionally used the <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?a.out(5)">
            a.out</ulink> format, a technology tried and proven through
            many generations of BSD releases. Though it has also been
            possible for some time to build and run native
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries (and kernels) on a FreeBSD
            system, FreeBSD initially resisted the <quote>push</quote> to
            switch to <acronym>ELF</acronym> as the default format. Why?
            Well, when the Linux camp made their painful transition to
            <acronym>ELF</acronym>, it was not so much to flee the
            <filename>a.out</filename> executable format as it was their
            inflexible jump-table based shared library mechanism, which
            made the construction of shared libraries very difficult for
            vendors and developers alike. Since the <acronym>ELF</acronym>
            tools available offered a solution to the shared library
            problem and were generally seen as <quote>the way
            forward</quote> anyway, the migration cost was accepted as
            necessary and the transition made.</para>

          <para>In FreeBSD's case, our shared library mechanism is based
            more closely on Sun's <emphasis remap=tt>SunOS</emphasis>-style
            shared library mechanism and, as such, is very easy to use.
            However, starting with 3.0, FreeBSD officially supports
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries as the default format. Even
            though the <filename>a.out</filename> executable format has
            served us well, the GNU people, who author the compiler tools
            we use, have dropped support for the <filename>a.out</filename>
            format. This has forced us to maintain a divergent version of
            the compler and linker, and has kept us from reaping the
            benefits of the latest GNU development efforts. Also the
            demands of ISO-C++, notably contstructors and destructors, has
            also led to native <acronym>ELF</acronym> support in future
            FreeBSD releases.</para>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>Yes, but why are there so many different formats?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Back in the dim, dark past, there was simple hardware.
            This simple hardware supported a simple, small system. a.out
            was completely adequate for the job of representing binaries on
            this simple system (a PDP-11). As people ported unix from this
            simple system, they retained the a.out format because it was
            sufficient for the early ports of unix to architectures like
            the Motorola 68k, VAXen, etc.</para>

          <para>Then some bright hardware engineer decided that if he
            could force software to do some sleazy tricks, then he'd be
            able to shave a few gates off the design and allow his CPU core
            to run faster. While it was made to work with this new kind of
            hardware (known these days as RISC), <filename>a.out</filename>
            was ill-suited for this hardware, so many formats were
            developed to get to a better performance from this hardware
            than the limited, simple <filename>a.out</filename> format
            could offer. Things like <acronym>COFF</acronym>,
            <acronym>ECOFF</acronym>, and a few obscure others were
            invented and their limitations explored before things seemed to
            settle on <acronym>ELF</acronym>.</para>

          <para>In addition, program sizes were getting huge and disks
            (and physical memory) were still relatively small so the
            concept of a shared library was born. The VM system also became
            more sophisticated. While each one of these advancements was
            done using the <filename>a.out</filename> format, its
            usefulness was stretched more and more with each new feature.
            In addition, people wanted to dynamically load things at run
            time, or to junk parts of their program after the init code had
            run to save in core memory and/or swap space. Languages became
            more sophistocated and people wanted code called before main
            automatically. Lots of hacks were done to the
            <filename>a.out</filename> format to allow all of these things
            to happen, and they basically worked for a time. In time,
            <filename>a.out</filename> wasn't up to handling all these
            problems without an ever increasing overhead in code and
            complexity. While <acronym>ELF</acronym> solved many of these
            problems, it would be painful to switch from the system that
            basically worked. So <acronym>ELF</acronym> had to wait until
            it was more painful to remain with <filename>a.out</filename>
            than it was to migrate to <acronym>ELF</acronym>.</para>

          <para>However, as time passed, the build tools that FreeBSD
            derived their build tools from (the assembler and loader
            especially) evolved in two parallel trees. The FreeBSD tree
            added shared libraries and fixed some bugs. The GNU folks that
            originally write these programs rewrote them and added simpler
            support for building cross compilers, plugging in different
            formats at will, etc. Since many people wanted to build cross
            compilers targeting FreeBSD, they were out of luck since the
            older sources that FreeBSD had for as and ld weren't up to the
            task. The new gnu tools chain (binutils) does support cross
            compiling, <acronym>ELF</acronym>, shared libraries, C++
            extnensions, etc. In addition, many vendors are releasing
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries, and it is a good thing for
            FreeBSD to run them. And if it is running
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries, why bother having
            <filename>a.out</filename> any more? It is a tired old horse
            that has proven useful for a long time, but it is time to turn
            him out to pasture for his long, faithful years of
            service.</para>

          <para><acronym>ELF</acronym> is more expressive than a.out and
            will allow more extensibility in the base system. The
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> tools are better maintained, and offer
            cross compilation support, which is important to many people.
            <acronym>ELF</acronym> may be a little slower than a.out, but
            trying to measure it can be difficult. There are also numerous
            details that are different between the two in how they map
            pages, handle init code, etc. None of these are very important,
            but they are differences. In time support for
            <filename>a.out</filename> will be moved out of the GENERIC
            kernel, and eventually removed from the kernel once the need to
            run legacy <filename>a.out</filename> programs is past.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Symlinks do not have permissions, and by default,
            &man.chmod.1; will not follow symlinks to change the
            permissions on the target file. So if you have a file,
            <filename>foo</filename>, and a symlink to that file,
            <filename>bar</filename>, then this command will always
            succeed.</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod g-w bar</userinput></screen>

          <para>However, the permissions on <filename>foo</filename> will
            not have changed.</para>

          <para>You have to use either <option>-H</option> or
            <option>-L</option> together with the <option>-R</option>
            option to make this work.  See the <ulink

                specifying directories or symlinks to directories to

                chmod</ulink> without any options and follow the symlink
                with a trailing slash (<filename>/</filename>).  For
                example, if <filename>foo</filename> is a symlink to

                the permissions of <filename>foo</filename> (actually

          <para>Why are login names <emphasis remap=bf>still</emphasis>
            restricted to 8 characters?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>

          <para>You'd think it'd be easy enough to change 
            <literal>UT_NAMESIZE</literal> and rebuild the whole world,
            and everything would just work. Unfortunately there are often
            scads of applications and utilities (including system tools)
            that have hard-coded small numbers (not always
            <literal>8</literal> or <literal>9</literal>, but oddball ones
            like <literal>15</literal> and <literal>20</literal>) in
            structures and buffers. Not only will this get you log files
            which are trashed (due to variable-length records getting
            written when fixed records were expected), but it can break
            Sun's NIS clients and potentially cause other problems in
            interacting with other UNIX systems.</para>

          <para>In FreeBSD 3.0 and later, the maximum name length has
            been increased to 16 characters and those various utilities
            with hard-coded name sizes have been found and fixed. The fact
            that this touched so many areas of the system is why, in fact,
            the change was not made until 3.0.</para>

          <para>If you're absolutely confident in your ability to find
            and fix these sorts of problems for yourself when and if they
            pop up, you can increase the login name length in earlier
            releases by editing /usr/include/utmp.h and changing
            UT_NAMESIZE accordingly. You must also update MAXLOGNAME in
            /usr/include/sys/param.h to match the UT_NAMESIZE change.
            Finally, if you build from sources, don't forget that
            /usr/include is updated each time! Change the appropriate files
            in /usr/src/.. instead.</para>

          <para>How cool is FreeBSD?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Q. Has anyone done any temperature testing while
            running FreeBSD? I know Linux runs cooler than dos, but have
            never seen a mention of FreeBSD. It seems to run really
            hot.</para>

          <para>A. No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
            blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
            LSD-25 administered beforehand. 35% of the volunteers said that
            FreeBSD tasted sort of orange, whereas Linux tasted like purple
            haze. Neither group mentioned any particular variances in
            temperature that I can remember. We eventually had to throw the
            results of this survey out entirely anyway when we found that
            too many volunteers were wandering out of the room during the
            tests, thus skewing the results. I think most of the volunteers
            are at Apple now, working on their new <quote>scratch and
            sniff</quote> GUI. It's a funny old business we're in!</para>

          <para>Seriously, both FreeBSD and Linux use the
            <acronym>HLT</acronym> (halt) instruction when the system is
            idle thus lowering its energy consumption and therefore the
            heat it generates. Also if you have APM (advanced power

        <answer>
          <para>Q. Is there anything <quote>odd</quote> that FreeBSD
            does when compiling the kernel which would cause the memory to
            make a scratchy sound? When compiling (and for a brief moment
            after recognizing the floppy drive upon startup, as well), a
            strange scratchy sound emanates from what appears to be the
            memory banks.</para>

          <para>A. Yes!  You'll see frequent references to
            <quote>daemons</quote> in the BSD documentation, and what most
            people don't know is that this refers to genuine, non-corporeal
            entities that now possess your computer. The scratchy sound
            coming from your memory is actually high-pitched whispering
            exchanged among the daemons as they best decide how to deal
            with various system administration tasks.</para>

          <para>If the noise gets to you, a good
            <command>fdisk /mbr</command> from DOS will get rid of them,
            but don't be surprised if they react adversely and try to stop
            you. In fact, if at any point during the exercise you hear the
            satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the built-in speaker,
            take off running and don't ever look back! Freed from the
            counterbalancing influence of the BSD daemons, the twin demons
            of DOS and Windows are often able to re-assert total control
            over your machine to the eternal damnation of your soul. Given
            a choice, I think I'd prefer to get used to the scratchy
            noises, myself!</para>

          <para>A repo-copy (which is a short form of <quote>repository
            copy</quote>) refers to the direct copying of files within
            the CVS repository.</para>

          <para>Without a repo-copy, if a file needed to be copied or
            moved to another place in the repository, the committer would
            run <command>cvs add</command> to put the file in its new
            location, and then <command>cvs rm</command> on the old file
            if the old copy was being removed.</para>

          <para>The disadvantage of this method is that the history
            (i.e. the entries in the CVS logs) of the file would not be
            copied to the new location. As the FreeBSD Project considers
            this history very useful, a repository copy is often used
            instead. This is a process where one of the repository meisters
            will copy the files directly within the repository, rather than
            using the <command>cvs</command> program.</para>

          <para>The really, really short answer is that you shouldn't.
            The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are
            capable of building a bikeshed doesn't mean you should stop
            others from building one just because you don't like the
            color they plan to paint it.  This is a metaphor indicating
            that you need not argue about every little feature just
            because you know enough to do so.  Some people have
            commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is
            inversely proportional to the complexity of the
            change.</para>

            <para>It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but
              it is quite short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote
              a book in the early 1960'ies, called <quote>Parkinson's
              Law</quote>, which contains a lot of insight into the
              dynamics of management.</para>

            <para>[snip a bit of commentary on the book]</para>

            <para>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the
              other vital component is an atomic power-plant, I guess
              that illustrates the age of the book.</para>

            <para>Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of
              directors and get approval for building a multi-million or
              even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to
              build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless
              discussions.</para>

            <para>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic
              plant is so vast, so expensive and so complicated that
              people cannot grasp it, and rather than try, they fall
              back on the assumption that somebody else checked all the
              details before it got this far.  Richard P. Feynmann
              gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,
              examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.</para>

            <para>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one
              of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch the
              game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no matter how
              reasonable you are with your proposal, somebody will seize
              the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is
              paying attention, that he is
              <emphasis>here</emphasis>.</para>

            <para>In Denmark we call it <quote>setting your
              fingerprint</quote>.  It is about personal pride and
              prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere and
              say <quote>There!  <emphasis>I</emphasis> did that.</quote>
              It is a strong trait in politicians, but present in most
              people given the chance.  Just think about footsteps in
              wet cement.</para>

        <question id="custrel">
          <para>How do I make my own custom release?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>To make a release you need to do three things: First,
            you need to be running a kernel with the <ulink
            URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?vn">vn</ulink>
            driver configured in.  Add this to your kernel config file
            and build a new kernel:</para>

          <programlisting>pseudo-device vn         #Vnode driver (turns a file into a device)</programlisting>

          <para>Second, you have to have the whole CVS repository at
            hand.  To get this you can use <ulink
            URL="../handbook/synching.html#CVSUP">CVSUP</ulink> but in
            your supfile set the release name to cvs and remove any tag or
            date fields:</para>

          <programlisting>*default prefix=/home/ncvs
*default base=/a
*default host=cvsup.FreeBSD.org
*default release=cvs
*default delete compress use-rel-suffix

## Main Source Tree
src-all
src-eBones
src-secure

# Other stuff
ports-all
www
doc-all</programlisting>

          <para>Then run <command>cvsup -g supfile</command> to suck all
            the good bits onto your box...</para>

          <para>Finally, you need a chunk of empty space to build into.
            Let's say it's in <filename>/some/big/filesystem</filename>,
            and from the example above you've got the CVS repository in
            <filename>/home/ncvs</filename>:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>setenv CVSROOT /home/ncvs</userinput> # or export CVSROOT=/home/ncvs
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildworld</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/release</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make release BUILDNAME=3.0-MY-SNAP CHROOTDIR=/some/big/filesystem/release</userinput>
      </screen>

          <blockquote>
            <note>
              <para>Please note that you <emphasis>do not</emphasis>
                need to build world if you already have a populated

            </note>
          </blockquote>

          <para>An entire release will be built in
            <filename>/some/big/filesystem/release</filename> and you
            will have a full FTP-type installation in
            <filename>/some/big/filesystem/release/R/ftp</filename> when
            you're done.  If you want to build your SNAP along some other
            branch than -CURRENT, you can also add
            <literal>RELEASETAG=SOMETAG</literal> to the make release
            command line above, e.g. <literal>RELEASETAG=RELENG_2_2</literal>
            would build an up-to-the- minute 2.2-STABLE snapshot.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>The entire process of creating installation disks and
            source and binary archives is automated by various targets in
            <filename>/usr/src/release/Makefile</filename>. The information
            there should be enough to get you started. However, it should
            be said that this involves doing a <command>make

            disk space.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Yes, this is the general idea; as its name might suggest,
            <command>make world</command> rebuilds every system binary from
            scratch, so you can be certain of having a clean and consistent
            environment at the end (which is why it takes so long).</para>

          <para>If the environment variable <literal>DESTDIR</literal>
            is defined while running <command>make world</command> or
            <command>make install</command>, the newly-created binaries
            will be deposited in a directory tree identical to the
            installed one, rooted at <literal>&#36;{DESTDIR}</literal>.
            Some random combination of shared libraries modifications and
            program rebuilds can cause this to fail in <command>make
            world</command> however.</para>

        <answer>

          <para>The Adaptec 1542 SCSI host adapters allow the user to
            configure their bus access speed in software. Previous versions
            of the 1542 driver tried to determine the fastest usable speed
            and set the adapter to that. We found that this breaks some
            users' systems, so you now have to define the
            <symbol>TUNE_1542</symbol> kernel configuration option in order
            to have this take place. Using it on those systems where it
            works may make your disks run faster, but on those systems
            where it doesn't, your data could be corrupted.</para>

          <para>By: <ulink URL="mailto:uhclem@nemesis.lonestar.org">
            Frank Durda IV</ulink></para>

          <para>In a nutshell, there a few I/O ports that all of the
            PnP boards respond to when the host asks if anyone is out
            there. So when the PnP probe routine starts, he asks if there
            are any PnP boards present, and all the PnP boards respond with
            their model # to a I/O read of the same port, so the probe
            routine gets a wired-OR <quote>yes</quote> to that question. At
            least one bit will be on in that reply. Then the probe code is
            able to cause boards with board model IDs (assigned by
            Microsoft/Intel) lower than X to go <quote>off-line</quote>. It
            then looks to see if any boards are still responding to the
            query. If the answer was <literal>0</literal>, then there are
            no boards with IDs above X. Now probe asks if there are any
            boards below <literal>X</literal>. If so, probe knows there are
            boards with a model numbers below X. Probe then asks for boards
            greater than X-(limit/4) to go off-line. If repeats the query.
            By repeating this semi-binary search of IDs-in-range enough
            times, the probing code will eventually identify all PnP boards
            present in a given machine with a number of iterations that is
            much lower than what 2^64 would take.</para>

          <para>The IDs are two 32-bit fields (hence 2&circ;64) + 8 bit
            checksum. The first 32 bits are a vendor identifier. They never
            come out and say it, but it appears to be assumed that
            different types of boards from the same vendor could have
            different 32-bit vendor ids. The idea of needing 32 bits just
            for unique manufacturers is a bit excessive.</para>

          <para>The lower 32 bits are a serial #, ethernet address,
            something that makes this one board unique. The vendor must
            never produce a second board that has the same lower 32 bits
            unless the upper 32 bits are also different. So you can have
            multiple boards of the same type in the machine and the full 64
            bits will still be unique.</para>

          <para>The 32 bit groups can never be all zero.  This allows the
            wired-OR to show non-zero bits during the initial binary
            search.</para>

          <para>Once the system has identified all the board IDs present,
            it will reactivate each board, one at a time (via the same I/O
            ports), and find out what resources the given board needs, what
            interrupt choices are available, etc. A scan is made over all
            the boards to collect this information.</para>

          <para>This info is then combined with info from any ECU files
            on the hard disk or wired into the MLB BIOS. The ECU and BIOS
            PnP support for hardware on the MLB is usually synthetic, and
            the peripherals don't really do genuine PnP. However by
            examining the BIOS info plus the ECU info, the probe routines
            can cause the devices that are PnP to avoid those devices the
            probe code cannot relocate.</para>

          <para>Then the PnP devices are visited once more and given
            their I/O, DMA, IRQ and Memory-map address assignments. The
            devices will then appear at those locations and remain there
            until the next reboot, although there is nothing that says you
            can't move them around whenever you want.</para>

          <para>There is a lot of oversimplification above, but you
            should get the general idea.</para>

          <para>Microsoft took over some of the primary printer status
            ports to do PnP, on the logic that no boards decoded those
            addresses for the opposing I/O cycles. I found a genuine IBM
            printer board that did decode writes of the status port during
            the early PnP proposal review period, but MS said
            <quote>tough</quote>. So they do a write to the printer status
            port for setting addresses, plus that use that address +
            <literal>0x800</literal>, and a third I/O port for reading that
            can be located anywhere between <literal>0x200</literal> and
            <literal>0x3ff</literal>.</para>

        <answer>

          <para>Several groups of people have expressed interest in
            working on multi-architecture ports for FreeBSD and the
            FreeBSD/AXP (ALPHA) port is one such effort which has been
            quite successful, now available in 3.0 SNAPshot release form at
            <ulink URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/alpha/">
            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/alpha</ulink>. The ALPHA port
            currently runs on a growing number of ALPHA machine types,
            among them the AlphaStation, AXPpci, PC164, Miata and Multia
            models. This port is not yet considered a full release and
            won't be until a full compliment of system installation tools
            and a distribution on CDROM installation media is available,
            including a reasonable number of working ports and packages.
            FreeBSD/AXP should be considered BETA quality software at this
            time. For status information, please join the

        <question>
          <para>Alternative layout policies for directories</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>In answer to the question of alternative layout policies
            for directories, the scheme that is currently in use is
            unchanged from what I wrote in 1983. I wrote that policy for
            the original fast filesystem, and never revisited it. It works
            well at keeping cylinder groups from filling up. As several of
            you have noted, it works poorly for find. Most filesystems are
            created from archives that were created by a depth first search
            (aka ftw). These directories end up being striped across the
            cylinder groups thus creating a worst possible senario for
            future depth first searches. If one knew the total number of
            directories to be created, the solution would be to create
            (total / fs_ncg) per cylinder group before moving on.
            Obviously, one would have to create some heuristic to guess at
            this number. Even using a small fixed number like say 10 would
            make an order of magnitude improvement. To differentiate
            restores from normal operation (when the current algorithm is
            probably more sensible), you could use the clustering of up to
            10 if they were all done within a ten second window. Anyway, my
            conclusion is that this is an area ripe for
            experimentation.</para>

            [When] you see a message like this, it's not enough to just
            reproduce it and send it in. The instruction pointer value that
            I highlighted up there is important; unfortunately, it's also
            configuration dependent. In other words, the value varies
            depending on the exact kernel image that you're using. If
            you're using a GENERIC kernel image from one of the snapshots,
            then it's possible for somebody else to track down the
            offending function, but if you're running a custom kernel then
            only <emphasis>you</emphasis> can tell us where the fault
            occured.</para>

          <para> What you should do is this:</para>

          <para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Write down the instruction pointer value. Note that
                  the <literal>0x8:</literal> part at the begining is not
                  significant in this case: it's the
                  <literal>0xf0xxxxxx</literal> part that we want.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>When the system reboots, do the following:

                  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm /kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxxx</userinput></screen>

                  where <literal>f0xxxxxx</literal> is the instruction
                  pointer value. The odds are you will not get an exact
                  match since the symbols in the kernel symbol table are
                  for the entry points of functions and the instruction
                  pointer address will be somewhere inside a function, not
                  at the start. If you don't get an exact match, omit the
                  last digit from the instruction pointer value and try
                  again, i.e.:

                  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm /kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxx</userinput></screen>

                   If that doesn't yield any results, chop off another
                   digit. Repeat until you get some sort of output. The
                   result will be a possible list of functions which caused
                   the panic. This is a less than exact mechanism for
                   tracking down the point of failure, but it's better than
                   nothing.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para> I see people constantly show panic messages like this
            but rarely do I see someone take the time to match up the
            instruction pointer with a function in the kernel symbol
            table.</para>

          <para> The best way to track down the cause of a panic is by
            capturing a crash dump, then using <command>gdb(1)</command>
            to to a stack trace on the crash dump. Of course, this depends
            on <command>gdb(1)</command> in -CURRENT working correctly,
            which I can't guarantee (I recall somebody saying that the new
            ELF-ized <command>gdb(1)</command> didn't handle kernel crash
            dumps correctly: somebody should check this before 3.0 goes out
            of beta or there'll be a lot of red faces after the CDs
            ship).</para>

          <para> To make sure you capture a crash dump, you need edit

            <emphasis remap=tt>dumpdev</emphasis> to point to your swap
            partition. This will cause the <command>rc(8)</command> scripts
            to use the <command>dumpon(8)</command> command to enable crash
            dumps. You can also run <command>dumpon(8)</command> manually.
            After a panic, the crash dump can be recovered using
            <command>savecore(8)</command>; if <emphasis
            remap=tt>dumpdev</emphasis> is set in
            <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the <command>rc(8)</command>
            scripts will run <command>savecore(8)</command> automatically
            and put the crash dump in
            <filename>/var/crash</filename>.</para>

          <para>
            <note>
              <para>FreeBSD crash dumps are usually the same size as the
                physical RAM size of your machine. That is, if you have
                64MB of RAM, you will get a 64MB crash dump. Therefore you
                must make sure there's enough space in
                <filename>/var/crash</filename> to hold the dump.
                Alternatively, you run <command>savecore(8)</command>
                manually and have it recover the crash dump to another
                directory where you have more room. It's possible to limit
                the size of the crash dump by using <literal>options
                MAXMEM=(foo)</literal> to set the amount of memory the
                kernel will use to something a little more sensible. For
                example, if you have 128MB of RAM, you can limit the
                kernel's memory usage to 16MB so that your crash dump size
                will be 16MB instead of 128MB.</para>
            </note></para>

          <para> Once you have recovered the crash dump, you can get a
            stack trace with <command>gdb(1)</command> as follows:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>gdb -k /sys/compile/KERNELCONFIG/kernel.debug /var/crash/vmcore.0</userinput>
<prompt>(gdb)</prompt> <userinput>where</userinput></screen>

          <para> Note that there may be several screens worth of
            information; ideally you should use
            <command>script(1)</command> to capture all of them. Using the
            unstripped kernel image with all the debug symbols should show
            the exact line of kernel source code where the panic occured.
            Usually you have to read the stack trace from the bottom up in
            order to trace the exact sequence of events that lead to the
            crash. You can also use <command>gdb(1)</command> to print out
            the contents of various variables or structures in order to
            examine the system state at the time of the crash.</para>

          <para> Now, if you're really insane and have a second computer,
            you can also configure <command>gdb(1)</command> to do remote
            debugging such that you can use <command>gdb(1)</command> on
            one system to debug the kernel on another system, including
            setting breakpoints, single-stepping through the kernel code,
            just like you can do with a normal user-mode program. I haven't
            played with this yet as I don't often have the chance to set up
            two machines side by side for debugging purposes.</para>

          <para> <emphasis>[Bill adds: "I forgot to mention one thing: if
            you have DDB enabled and the kernel drops into the debugger,
            you can force a panic (and a crash dump) just by typing 'panic'
            at the ddb prompt. It may stop in the debugger again during the
            panic phase. If it does, type 'continue' and it will finish the
            crash dump." -ed]</emphasis></para>

        <question>
          <para>Increasing or reducing the kernel address space</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>By default, the kernel address space is 256 MB on
            FreeBSD 3.x and 1 GB on FreeBSD 4.x. If you run a
            network-intensive server (e.g. a large FTP or HTTP server),
            you might find that 256 MB is not enough.</para>

          <para>So how do you increase the address space? There are two
            aspects to this. First, you need to tell the kernel to reserve
            a larger portion of the address space for itself. Second, since
            the kernel is loaded at the top of the address space, you need
            to lower the load address so it doesn't bump its head against
            the ceiling.</para>

          <para>The first goal is achieved by increasing the value of
            <literal>NKPDE</literal> in
            <filename>src/sys/i386/include/pmap.h</filename>. Here's what
            it looks like for a 1 GB address space:</para>

          <programlisting>#ifndef NKPDE
#ifdef SMP
#define NKPDE                   254     /* addressable number of page tables/pde's */
#else
#define NKPDE                   255     /* addressable number of page tables/pde's */
#endif  /* SMP */
#endif</programlisting>

          <para>To find the correct value of <literal>NKPDE</literal>,
            divide the desired address space size (in megabytes) by four,
            then subtract one for UP and two for SMP.</para>

          <para>To achieve the second goal, you need to compute the
            correct load address: simply subtract the address space size
            (in bytes) from 0x100100000; the result is 0xc0100000 for a 1
            GB address space. Set <symbol>LOAD_ADDRESS</symbol> in
            <filename>src/sys/i386/conf/Makefile.i386</filename> to that
            value; then set the location counter in the beginning of the
            section listing in
            <filename>src/sys/i386/conf/kernel.script</filename> to the
            same value, as follows:</para>

          <programlisting>OUTPUT_FORMAT("elf32-i386", "elf32-i386", "elf32-i386")
OUTPUT_ARCH(i386)
ENTRY(btext)
SEARCH_DIR(/usr/lib); SEARCH_DIR(/usr/obj/elf/home/src/tmp/usr/i386-unknown-freebsdelf/lib);
SECTIONS
{
  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  . = 0xc0100000 + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
  .interp     : { *(.interp)    }</programlisting>

          <para>Then reconfig and rebuild your kernel. You will probably
            have problems with <command>ps(1)</command>,
            <command>top(1)</command> and the like; <emphasis remap=tt>make
            world</emphasis> should take care of it (or a manual rebuild of
            <emphasis remap=tt>libkvm</emphasis>, <emphasis
            remap=tt>ps</emphasis> and <emphasis remap=tt>top</emphasis>
            after copying the patched <filename>pmap.h</filename> to
            <filename>/usr/include/vm/</filename>.</para>

          <para>NOTE: the size of the kernel address space must be a
            multiple of four megabytes.</para>

          <para>[&a.dg; adds: <emphasis> I think the kernel address space
            needs to be a power of two, but I'm not certain about that. The
          old(er) boot code used to monkey with the high order address bits
          and I think expected at least 256MB
          granularity.]</emphasis></para>

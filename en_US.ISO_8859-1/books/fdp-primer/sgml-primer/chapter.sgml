<chapter id="sgml-primer">
  <title>SGML Primer</title>

  <para>The majority of FDP documentation is written in applications of
    SGML.  This chapter explains exactly what that means, how to read
    and understand the source to the documentation, and the sort of SGML
    tricks you will see used in the documentation.</para>

  <para>Portions of this section were inspired by Mark Galassi's <ulink
      url="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro/docbook-intro.html">Get Going With DocBook</ulink>.</para>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Way back when, electronic text was simple to deal with.  Admittedly, 
      you had to know which character set your document was written in (ASCII, 
      EBCDIC, or one of a number of others) but that was about it.  Text was
      text, and what you saw really was what you got.  No frills, no
      formatting, no intelligence.</para>

    <para>Inevitably, this was not enough.  Once you have text in a
      machine-usable format, you expect machines to be able to use it and
      manipulate it intelligently.  You would like to indicate that certain
      phrases should be emphasised, or added to a glossary, or be hyperlinks.
      You might want filenames to be shown in a &ldquo;typewriter&rdquo; style 
      font for viewing on screen, but as &ldquo;italics&rdquo; when printed,
      or any of a myriad of other options for presentation.</para>

    <para>It was once hoped that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would make this
      easy.  Your computer would read in the document and automatically
      identify key phrases, filenames, text that the reader should type in,
      examples, and more.  Unfortunately, real life has not happened quite
      like that, and our computers require some assistance before they can
      meaningfully process our text.</para>

    <para>More precisely, they need help identifying what is what.  You or I
      can look at

      <blockquote>
	<para>To remove <filename>/tmp/foo</filename> use &man.rm.1;.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <command>rm /tmp/foo</command></screen>
      </blockquote>

      and easily see which parts are filenames, which are commands to be typed
      in, which parts are references to manual pages, and so on.  But the
      computer processing the document can not.  For this we need
      markup.</para>
    
    <para>&ldquo;Markup&rdquo; is commonly used to describe &ldquo;adding
      value&rdquo; or &ldquo;increasing cost&rdquo;.  The term takes on both
      these meanings when applied to text.  Markup is additional text included 
      in the document, distinguished from the document's content in some way,
      so that programs that process the document can read the markup and use
      it when making decisions about the document.  Editors can hide the
      markup from the user, so the user is not distracted by it.</para>

    <para>The extra information stored in the markup <emphasis>adds
	value</emphasis> to the document.  Adding the markup to the document
      must typically be done by a person&mdash;after all, if computers could
      recognise the text sufficiently well to add the markup then there would
      be no need to add it in the first place.  This <emphasis>increases the
	cost</emphasis> of the document.</para>

    <para>The previous example is actually represented in this document like
      this;</para>

    <programlisting><![ CDATA [
<para>To remove <filename>/tmp/foo</filename> use &man.rm.1;.</para>

<para><command>rm /tmp/foo</command></para>]]></programlisting>

    <para>As you can see, the markup is clearly separate from the
      content.</para>

    <para>Obviously, if you are going to use markup you need to define what
      your markup means, and how it should be interpreted.  You will need a
      markup language that you can follow when marking up your
      documents.</para>
    
   <para>Of course, one markup language might not be enough.  A markup
      language for technical documentation has very different requirements
      than a markup language that was to be used for cookery recipes.  This,
      in turn, would be very different from a markup language used to describe
      poetry.  What you really need is a first language that you use to write
      these other markup languages.  A <emphasis>meta markup
	language</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <para>This is exactly what the Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML)
      is.  Many markup languages have been written in SGML, including the two
      most used by the FDP, HTML and DocBook.</para>
    
    <para>Each language definition is more properly called a Document Type
      Definition (DTD).  The DTD specifies the name of the elements that can
      be used, what order they appear in (and whether some markup can be used
      inside other markup) and related information.  A DTD is sometimes
      referred to as an <emphasis>application</emphasis> of SGML.</para>

    <para id="sgml-primer-validating">A DTD is a <emphasis>complete</emphasis>
      specification of all the elements that are allowed to appear, the order
      in which they should appear, which elements are mandatory, which are
      optional, and so forth. This makes it possible to write an SGML
      <emphasis>parser</emphasis> which reads in both the DTD and a document
      which claims to conform to the DTD.  The parser can then confirm whether
      or not all the elements required by the DTD are in the document in the
      right order, and whether there are any errors in the markup.  This is
      normally referred to as <quote>validating  the document</quote>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>This processing simply confirms that the choice of elements, their 
	ordering, and so on, conforms to that listed in the DTD.  It does
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> check that you have used
	<emphasis>appropriate</emphasis> markup for the content.  If you were
	to try and mark up all the filenames in your document as function
	names, the parser would not flag this as an error (assuming, of
	course, that your DTD defines elements for filenames and functions,
	and that they are allowed to appear in the same place).</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>It is likely that most of your contributions to the Documentation
      Project will consist of content marked up in either HTML or DocBook,
      rather than alterations to the DTDs.  For this reason this book will
      not touch on how to write a DTD.</para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="sgml-primer-elements">
    <title>Elements, tags, and attributes</title>

    <para>All the DTDs written in SGML share certain characteristics.  This is
      hardly surprising, as the philosophy behind SGML will inevitably show
      through. One of the most obvious manifestations of this philisophy is
      that of <emphasis>content</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>elements</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Your documentation (whether it is a single web page, or a lengthy
      book) is considered to consist of content.  This content is then divided
      (and further subdivided) into elements.  The purpose of adding markup is
      to name and identify the boundaries of these elements for further
      processing.</para>

    <para>For example, consider a typical book.  At the very top level, the
      book is itself an element.  This &ldquo;book&rdquo; element obviously
      contains chapters, which can be considered to be elements in their own
      right.  Each chapter will contain more elements, such as paragraphs,
      quotations, and footnotes.  Each paragraph might contain further
      elements, identifying content that was direct speech, or the name of a
      character in the story.</para>

    <para>You might like to think of this as &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; content.
      At the very top level you have one chunk, the book.  Look a little
      deeper, and you have more chunks, the individual chapters.  These are
      chunked further into paragraphs, footnotes, character names, and so
      on.</para>

    <para>Notice how you can make this differentation between different
      elements of the content without resorting to any SGML terms.  It really
      is surprisingly straightforward.  You could do this with a highlighter
      pen and a printout of the book, using different colours to indicate
      different chunks of content.</para>

    <para>Of course, we do not have an electronic highlighter pen, so we need
      some other way of indicating which element each piece of content belongs
      to.  In languages written in SGML (HTML, DocBook, et al) this is done by
      means of <emphasis>tags</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A tag is used to identify where a particular element starts, and
      where the element ends.  <emphasis>The tag is not part of the element
	itself</emphasis>. Because each DTD was normally written to mark up
      specific types of information, each one will recognise different
      elements, and will therefore have different names for the tags.</para>

    <para>For an element called <replaceable>element-name</replaceable> the
      start tag will normally look like
      <literal>&lt;<replaceable>element-name</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.  The
      corresponding closing tag for this element is
      <literal>&lt;/<replaceable>element-name</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an element (start and end tags)</title>

      <para>HTML has an element for indicating that the content enclosed by
	the element is a paragraph, called <literal>p</literal>.  This
	element has both start and end tags.</para>
      
      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p>This is a paragraph.  It starts with the start tag for
  the 'p' element, and it will end with the end tag for the 'p'
  element.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph.  But this one is much shorter.</p>]]></programlisting>	  
    </example>

    <para>Not all elements require an end tag.  Some elements have no content.
      For example, in HTML you can indicate that you want a horizontal line to
      appear in the document.  Obviously, this line has no content, so just
      the start tag is required for this element.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an element (start tag only)</title>

      <para>HTML has an element for indicating a horizontal rule, called
	<literal>hr</literal>.  This element does not wrap content, so only
	has a start tag.</para>

      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is another paragraph.  A horizontal rule separates this
  from the previous paragraph.</p>]]></programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>If it is not obvious by now, elements can contain other elements.
      In the book example earlier, the book element contained all the chapter
      elements, which in turn contained all the paragraph elements, and so
      on.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Elements within elements; <sgmltag>em</sgmltag></title>
      
      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p>This is a simple <em>paragraph</em> where some
  of the <em>words</em> have been <em>emphasised</em>.</p>]]></programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>The DTD will specify the rules detailing which elements can contain
      other elements, and exactly what they can contain.</para>

    <important>
      <para>People often confuse the terms tags and elements, and use the
	terms as if they were interchangeable.  They are not.</para>

      <para>An element is a conceptual part of your document.  An element has
	a defined start and end.  The tags mark where the element starts and
	end.</para>

      <para>When this document (or anyone else knowledgable about SGML) refers
	to &ldquo;the &lt;p&gt; tag&rdquo; they mean the literal text
	consisting of the three characters <literal>&lt;</literal>,
	<literal>p</literal>, and <literal>&gt;</literal>.  But the phrase
	&ldquo;the &lt;p&gt; element&rdquo; refers to the whole
	element.</para>

      <para>This distinction <emphasis>is</emphasis> very subtle.  But keep it 
	in mind.</para>
    </important>
      
    <para>Elements can have attributes.  An attribute has a name and a value,
      and is used for adding extra information to the element.  This might be
      information that indicates how the content should be rendered, or might
      be something that uniquely identifies that occurence of the element, or
      it might be something else.</para>

    <para>An element's attributes are written <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the
      start tag for that element, and take the form
      <literal><replaceable>attribute-name</replaceable>="<replaceable>attribute-value</replaceable>"</literal>.</para>

    <para>In sufficiently recent versions of HTML, the <sgmltag>p</sgmltag>
      element has an attribute called <literal>align</literal>, which suggests
      an alignment (justification) for the paragraph to the program displaying
      the HTML.</para>

    <para>The <literal>align</literal> attribute can take one of four defined
      values, <literal>left</literal>, <literal>center</literal>,
      <literal>right</literal> and <literal>justify</literal>.  If the
      attribute is not specified then the default is
      <literal>left</literal>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an element with an attribute</title>
      
      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p align="left">The inclusion of the align attribute
  on this paragraph was superfluous, since the default is left.</p>

<p align="center">This may appear in the center.</p>]]></programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>Some attributes will only take specific values, such as
      <literal>left</literal> or <literal>justify</literal>.  Others will
      allow you to enter anything you want.  If you need to include quotes
      (<literal>"</literal>) within an attribute then use single quotes around
      the attribute value.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Single quotes around attributes</title>
      
      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p align='right'>I'm on the right!</p>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Sometimes you do not need to use quotes around attribute values at
      all.  However, the rules for doing this are subtle, and it is far
      simpler just to <emphasis>always</emphasis> quote your attribute
      values.</para>

    <title>Escaping back to SGML</title>

    <para>Earlier in this primer I said that SGML is only used when writing a
      DTD.  This is not strictly true.  There is certain SGML syntax that you
      will want to be able to use within your documents.  For example,
      comments can be included in your document, and will be ignored by the
      parser.  Comments are entered using SGML syntax.  Other uses for SGML
      syntax in your document will be shown later too.</para>
      
    <para>Obviously, you need some way of indicating to the SGML processor
      that the following content is not elements within the document, but is
      SGML that the parser should act upon.</para>

    <para>These sections are marked by <literal>&lt;! ...  &gt;</literal> in
      your document.  Everything between these delimiters is SGML syntax as
      you might find within a DTD.</para>

    <para>As you may just have realised, the <link
	linkend="sgml-primer-doctype-declaration">DOCTYPE declaration</link>
      is an example of SGML syntax that you need to include in your
      document&hellip;</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Comments</title>
    
    <para>Comments are an SGML construction, and are normally only valid
      inside a DTD.  However, as <xref linkend="sgml-primer-sgml-escape">
      shows, it is possible to use SGML syntax within your document.</para>

    <para>The delimiters for SGML comments is the string
      &ldquo;<literal>--</literal>&rdquo;.  The first occurence of this string
      opens a comment, and the second closes it.</para>

    <example>
      <title>SGML generic comment</title>

      <programlisting>
&lt;!-- test comment --></programlisting>
      
      <programlisting><![ CDATA [

      <para>There is a problem with producing the Postscript and PDF versions

	before the <literal>&gt;</literal>.</para>

      <para>You <emphasis>must</emphasis> use two <literal>-</literal>,
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> one.  The Postscript and PDF versions have

    <para>If you have used HTML before you may have been shown different rules

    <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the case.  A lot of web browsers

    <title>Entities</title>

    <para>Entities are a mechanism for assigning names to chunks of content.
      As an SGML parser processes your document, any entities it finds are
      replaced by the content of the entity.</para>
    
    <para>This is a good way to have re-usable, easily changeable chunks of
      content in your SGML documents.  It is also the only way to include one
      marked up file inside another using SGML.</para>
    
    <para>There are two types of entities which can be used in two different
      situations; <emphasis>general entities</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>parameter entities</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <sect2 id="sgml-primer-general-entities">
      <title>General Entities</title>
      
      <para>You can not use general entities in an SGML context (although you
	define them in one).  They can only be used in your document.
	Contrast this with <link
	  linkend="sgml-primer-parameter-entities">parameter
	  entities</link>.</para>

      <para>Each general entity has a name.  When you want to reference a
	general entity (and therefore include whatever text it represents in
	your document), you write
	<literal>&amp;<replaceable>entity-name</replaceable>;</literal>.  For
	example, suppose you had an entity called
	<literal>current.version</literal> which expanded to the current
	version number of your product.  You could write;</para>

      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<para>The current version of our product is
  &current.version;.</para>]]></programlisting>

      <para>When the version number changes you can simply change the
	definition of the value of the general entity and reprocess your
	document.</para>

      <para>You can also use general entities to enter characters that you
	could not otherwise include in an SGML document.  For example, &lt;
	and &amp; can not normally appear in an SGML document.  When the SGML
	parser sees the &lt; symbol it assumes that a tag (either a start tag
	or an end tag) is about to appear, and when it sees the &amp; symbol
	it assumes the next text will be the name of an entity.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, you can use the two general entities &amp;lt; and
	&amp;amp; whenever you need to include one or other of these </para>
	
      <para>A general entity can only be defined within an SGML context.
	Typically, this is done immediately after the DOCTYPE
	declaration.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Defining general entities</title>

	<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" [
<!ENTITY current.version    "3.0-RELEASE">
<!ENTITY last.version       "2.2.7-RELEASE">
]>]]></programlisting>
	  
	<para>Notice how the DOCTYPE declaration has been extended by adding a
	  square bracket at the end of the first line.  The two entities are
	  then defined over the next two lines, before the square bracket is
	  closed, and then the DOCTYPE declaration is closed.</para>

	<para>The square brackets are necessary to indicate that we are
	  extending the DTD indicated by the DOCTYPE declaration.</para>

      <para>Parameter entities are defined in a similar way to general

    <title>Marked sections</title>
    
    <para>SGML provides a mechanism to indicate that particular pieces of the
      document should be processed in a special way.  These are termed
      &ldquo;marked sections&rdquo;.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Structure of a marked section</title>

      <programlisting>
&lt;![ <replaceable>KEYWORD</replaceable> [
  Contents of marked section
]]&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>As you would expect, being an SGML construct, a marked section
      starts <literal>&lt!</literal>.</para>

    <para>The first square bracket begins to delimit the marked
      section.</para>

    <para><replaceable>KEYWORD</replaceable> describes how this marked
      section should be processed by the parser.</para>

    <para>The second square bracket indicates that the content of the marked
      section starts here.</para>
    
    <para>The marked section is finished by closing the two square brackets,
      and then returning to the document context from the SGML context with
      <literal>&gt;</literal></para>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Marked section keywords</title>
      
      <sect3>
	<title><literal>CDATA</literal>, <literal>RCDATA</literal></title>
	
	<para>These keywords denote the marked sections <emphasis>content
	    model</emphasis>, and allow you to change it from the
	  default.</para>
	
	<para>When an SGML parser is processing a document, it keeps track
	  of what is called the &ldquo;content model&rdquo;.</para>
	
	<para>Briefly, the content model describes what sort of content the
	  parser is expecting to see, and what it will do with it when it
	  finds it.</para>

	<para>The two content models you will probably find most useful are
	  <literal>CDATA</literal> and <literal>RCDATA</literal>.</para>
	
	<para><literal>CDATA</literal> is for &ldquo;Character Data&rdquo;.
	  If the parser is in this content model then it is expecting to see
	  characters, and characters only.  In this model the &lt; and &amp;
	  symbols lose their special status, and will be treated as ordinary
	  characters.</para>
	
	<para><literal>RCDATA</literal> is for &ldquo;Entity references and
	  character data&rdquo; If the parser is in this content model then it
	  is expecting to see characters <emphasis>and</emphasis> entities.
	  &lt; loses its special status, but &amp; will still be treated as
	  starting the beginning of a general entity.</para>
	
	<para>This is particularly useful if you are including some verbatim
	  text that contains lots of &lt; and &amp; characters.  While you
	  could go through the text ensuring that every &lt; is converted to a
	  &amp;lt; and every &amp; is converted to a &amp;amp;, it can be
	  easier to mark the section as only containing CDATA.  When the SGML
	  parser encounters this it will ignore the &lt; and &amp; symbols
	  embedded in the content.</para>

	<!-- The nesting of CDATA within the next example is disgusting -->
	  
	<example>
	  <title>Using a CDATA marked section</title>
	  
	  <programlisting>
&lt;para>Here is an example of how you would include some text
  that contained many &amp;lt; and &amp;amp; symbols.  The sample
  text is a fragment of HTML.  The surrounding text (&lt;para> and
  &lt;programlisting>) are from DocBook.&lt;/para>

&lt;programlisting>
  &lt![ CDATA [  <![ CDATA [
    <p>This is a sample that shows you some of the elements within
      HTML.  Since the angle brackets are used so many times, it's
      simpler to say the whole example is a CDATA marked section
      than to use the entity names for the left and right angle
      brackets throughout.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is a listitem</li>
      <li>This is a second listitem</li>
      <li>This is a third listitem</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the end of the example.</p>]]>
  ]]&gt;
&lt/programlisting></programlisting>

	  <para>If you look at the source for this document you will see this
	    technique used throughout.</para>
	</example>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3>
	<title><literal>INCLUDE</literal> and
	  <literal>IGNORE</literal></title>
	
	<para>If the keyword is <literal>INCLUDE</literal> then the contents
	  of the marked section will be processed.  If the keyword is
	  <literal>IGNORE</literal> then the marked section is ignored and
	  will not be processed.  It will not appear in the output.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <literal>INCLUDE</literal> and
	    <literal>IGNORE</literal> in marked sections</title>

	  <programlisting>
&lt;![ INCLUDE [
  This text will be processed and included.
]]&gt;

&lt;![ IGNORE [
  This text will not be processed or included.
]]&gt;</programlisting>
	</example>
	
	<para>By itself, this isn't too useful.  If you wanted to remove text
	  from your document you could cut it out, or wrap it in
	  comments.</para>
	  
	<para>It becomes more useful when you realise you can use <link
	    linkend="sgml-primer-parameter-entities">parameter entities</link>
	  to control this.  Remember that parameter entities can only be used
	  in SGML contexts, and the keyword of a marked section
	  <emphasis>is</emphasis> an SGML context.</para>

	<para>For example, suppose that you produced a hard-copy version of
	  some documentation and an electronic version.  In the electronic
	  version you wanted to include some extra content that wasn't to
	  appear in the hard-copy.</para>

	<para>Create a parameter entity, and set it's value to
	  <literal>INCLUDE</literal>.  Write your document, using marked
	  sections to delimit content that should only appear in the
	  electronic version.  In these marked sections use the parameter
	  entity in place of the keyword.</para>

	<para>When you want to produce the hard-copy version of the document,
	  change the parameter entity's value to <literal>IGNORE</literal> and
	  reprocess the document.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using a parameter entity to control a marked
	    section</title>
	  
	  <programlisting>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" [
&lt;!ENTITY % electronic.copy "INCLUDE">	     
]]&gt;

...

&lt;![ %electronic.copy [
  This content should only appear in the electronic
  version of the document.
]]&gt;</programlisting>

	  <para>When producing the hard-copy version, change the entity's
	    definition to;</para>
	  
	  <programlisting>
&lt!ENTITY % electronic.copy "IGNORE"></programlisting>

	  <para>On reprocessing the document, the marked sections that use
	    <literal>%electronic.copy</literal> as their keyword will be
	    ignored.</para>

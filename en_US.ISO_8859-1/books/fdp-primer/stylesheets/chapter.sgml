  <title>* Stylesheets</title>
    
  <para>SGML says nothing about how a document should be displayed to the
    user, or rendered on paper.  To do that, various languages have been
    developed to describe stylesheets, including DynaText, Panorama, SPICE,
    JSSS, FOSI, CSS, and DSSSL.</para>
  
  <para>For DocBook, we are using stylesheets written in DSSSL.  For HTML we
    are using CSS.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>* DSSSL</title>
    
    <para>The Documentation Project uses a slightly customised version of
      Norm Walsh's modular DocBook stylesheets.</para>
    
    <para>These can be found in
      <filename>textproc/dsssl-docbook-modular</filename>.</para>

    <para>The modified stylesheets are not in the ports system.  Instead they
      are part of the Documentation Project source repository, and can be
      found in <filename>doc/share/sgml/freebsd.dsl</filename>.  It is well
      commented, and pending completion of this section you are encouraged to
      examine that file to see how some of the available options in the
      standard stylesheets have been configured in order to customise the
      output for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  That file also contains
      examples showing how to extend the elements that the stylesheet
      understands, which is how the FreeBSD specific elements have been
      formatted.</para>

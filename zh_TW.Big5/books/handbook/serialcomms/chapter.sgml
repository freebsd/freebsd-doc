    <para>&unix; has always had support for serial communications.  In fact,
      the very first &unix; machines relied on serial lines for user input
      and output.  Things have changed a lot from the days when the average
      <quote>terminal</quote> consisted of a 10-character-per-second serial
      printer and a keyboard.  This chapter will cover some of the ways in
      which FreeBSD uses serial communications.</para>

      <title>Cables and Ports</title>
      
      <para>To connect a modem or terminal to your FreeBSD system, you
	will need a serial port on your computer and the proper cable to connect
	to your serial device.  If you are already familiar with your
	hardware and the cable it requires, you can safely skip this
	section.</para>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-cables">
	<title>Cables</title>

	<para>There are several different kinds of serial cables.  The
	  two most common types for our purposes are null-modem cables
	  and standard (<quote>straight</quote>) RS-232 cables.  The documentation
	  for your hardware should describe the type of cable
	  required.</para>
	    
	<sect4 id="term-cables-null">
	  <title>Null-modem Cables</title>

	  <indexterm>
	    <primary>null-modem cable</primary>
	  </indexterm>
	  <para>A null-modem cable passes some signals, such as <quote>Signal
	    Ground</quote>, straight through, but switches other signals.  For
	    example, the <quote>Transmitted Data</quote> pin on one end goes to the
	    <quote>Received Data</quote> pin on the other end.</para>
	      
	  <para>You can also construct your own null-modem cable for use with
	    terminals (e.g., for quality purposes).  This table shows the RS-232C
	    <link linkend="serialcomms-signal-names">signals</link> and the pin
	    numbers on a DB-25 connector.  Note that the standard also calls for a
	    straight-through pin 1 to pin 1 <emphasis>Protective Ground</emphasis>
	    line, but it is often omitted.  Some terminals work OK using only
	    pins 2, 3 and 7, while others require different configurations than
	    the examples shown below.</para>

	<para>Serial ports are the devices through which data is transferred

	  in FreeBSD.</para>

	<sect4 id="term-portkinds">
	  <title>Kinds of Ports</title>
	  
	  <para>Several kinds of serial ports exist.  Before you purchase or
	    construct a cable, you need to make sure it will fit the ports on
	    your terminal and on the FreeBSD system.</para>
	      
	  <para>Most terminals will have DB-25 ports.  Personal computers,
	    including PCs running FreeBSD, will have DB-25 or DB-9 ports. If you
	    have a multiport serial card for your PC, you may have RJ-12 or
	    RJ-45 ports.</para>
	      
	  <para>See the documentation that accompanied the hardware for
	    specifications on the kind of port in use.  A visual inspection of
	    the port often works too.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="term-portnames">
	  <title>Port Names</title>
	  
	  <para>In FreeBSD, you access each serial port through an entry in
	    the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.  There are two different
	    kinds of entries:</para>
	      
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Call-in ports are named
		<filename>/dev/ttyd<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>
		where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the port number,
		starting from zero.  Generally, you use the call-in port for
		terminals.  Call-in ports require that the serial line assert
		the data carrier detect (DCD) signal to work correctly.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Call-out ports are named
		<filename>/dev/cuad<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>.
		You usually do not use the call-out port for terminals, just
		for modems.  You may use the call-out port if the serial cable
		or the terminal does not support the carrier detect
		signal.</para>

	      <note><para>Call-out ports are named
		<filename>/dev/cuaa<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename> in
		&os;&nbsp;5.X and older.</para></note>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  <para>If you have connected a terminal to the first serial port
	    (<devicename>COM1</devicename> in &ms-dos;), then you will
	    use <filename>/dev/ttyd0</filename> to refer to the terminal.  If
	    the terminal is on the second serial port (also known as
	    <devicename>COM2</devicename>), use
	    <filename>/dev/ttyd1</filename>, and so forth.</para>

      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>
      
      <para>FreeBSD supports four serial ports by default.  In the
	&ms-dos; world, these are known as
	<devicename>COM1</devicename>,
	<devicename>COM2</devicename>,
	<devicename>COM3</devicename>, and 
	<devicename>COM4</devicename>.  FreeBSD currently supports
	<quote>dumb</quote> multiport serial interface cards, such as
	the BocaBoard 1008 and 2016, as well as more
	intelligent multi-port cards such as those made by Digiboard
	and Stallion Technologies.  However, the default kernel only looks
	for the standard COM ports.</para>
	  
      <para>To see if your kernel recognizes any of your serial ports, watch
	for messages while the kernel is booting, or use the
	<command>/sbin/dmesg</command> command to replay the kernel's boot
	messages.  In particular, look for messages that start with the

      <title>Device Special Files</title>
      
      <para>Most devices in the kernel are accessed through <quote>device

	parameters each time a port is opened, such as
	<literal>crtscts</literal> for modems which use
	<literal>RTS/CTS</literal> signaling for flow control.  The locking

    <title>Terminals</title>
    
    <indexterm><primary>terminals</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Terminals provide a convenient and low-cost way to access 
      your FreeBSD system when you are not at the computer's console or on
      a connected network.  This section describes how to use terminals with
      FreeBSD.</para>

    <sect2 id="term-uses">
      <title>Uses and Types of Terminals</title>
      
      <para>The original &unix; systems did not have consoles.  Instead, people
	logged in and ran programs through terminals that were connected to
	the computer's serial ports.  It is quite similar to using a modem and
	terminal software to dial into a remote system to do text-only
	work.</para>
	  
      <para>Today's PCs have consoles capable of high quality graphics, but
	the ability to establish a login session on a serial port still exists
	in nearly every &unix; style operating system today; FreeBSD is no
	exception.  By using a terminal attached to an unused serial port, you
	can log in and run any text program that you would normally run on the
	console or in an <command>xterm</command> window in the X Window
	System.</para>
	  
      <para>For the business user, you can attach many terminals to a FreeBSD
	system and place them on your employees' desktops.  For a home user, a
	spare computer such as an older IBM PC or a &macintosh; can be a
	terminal wired into a more powerful computer running FreeBSD.  You can
	turn what might otherwise be a single-user computer into a powerful
	multiple user system.</para>
	  
      <para>For FreeBSD, there are three kinds of terminals:</para>
	  
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><link linkend="term-dumb">Dumb terminals</link></para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><link linkend="term-x">X terminals</link></para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
	  
      <para>The remaining subsections describe each kind.</para>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-dumb">
	<title>Dumb Terminals</title>

	<para>Dumb terminals are specialized pieces of hardware that let you
	  connect to computers over serial lines.  They are called
	  <quote>dumb</quote> because they have only enough computational power
	  to display, send, and receive text.  You cannot run any programs on
	  them.  It is the computer to which you connect them that has all the
	  power to run text editors, compilers, email, games, and so
	  forth.</para>
	    
	<para>There are hundreds of kinds of dumb terminals made by many
	  manufacturers, including Digital Equipment Corporation's VT-100 and
	  Wyse's WY-75.  Just about any kind will work with FreeBSD. Some
	  high-end terminals can even display graphics, but only certain
	  software packages can take advantage of these advanced
	  features.</para>
	    
	<para>Dumb terminals are popular in work environments where workers do
	  not need access to graphical applications such as those provided by
	  the X Window System.</para>
      </sect3>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-pcs">
	<title>PCs Acting as Terminals</title>

	<para>If a <link linkend="term-dumb">dumb terminal</link> has just
	  enough ability to display, send, and receive text, then certainly
	  any spare personal computer can be a dumb terminal. All you need is
	  the proper cable and some <emphasis>terminal emulation</emphasis>
	  software to run on the computer.</para>
	    
	<para>Such a configuration is popular in homes.  For example, if your
	  spouse is busy working on your FreeBSD system's console, you can do
	  some text-only work at the same time from a less powerful personal
	  computer hooked up as a terminal to the FreeBSD system.</para>
      </sect3>
	  
      <sect3 id="term-x">
	<title>X Terminals</title>

	<para>X terminals are the most sophisticated kind of terminal
	  available.  Instead of connecting to a serial port, they usually
	  connect to a network like Ethernet.  Instead of being relegated to
	  text-only applications, they can display any X application.</para>
	    
	<para>We introduce X terminals just for the sake of completeness.
	  However, this chapter does <emphasis>not</emphasis> cover setup,
	  configuration, or use of X terminals.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="term-config">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      
      <para>This section describes what you need to configure on your FreeBSD
	system to enable a login session on a terminal.  It assumes you have
	already configured your kernel to support the serial port to which the
	terminal is connected&mdash;and that you have connected it.</para>
	  
      <para>Recall from <xref linkend="boot"> that the
	<command>init</command> process is responsible for all process
	control and initialization at system startup.  One of the
	tasks performed by <command>init</command> is to read the
	<filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file and start a
	<command>getty</command> process on the available terminals.
	The <command>getty</command> process is responsible for
	reading a login name and starting the <command>login</command>
	program.</para>
	  
      <para>Thus, to configure terminals for your FreeBSD system the
	following steps should be taken as <username>root</username>:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Add a line to <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> for the entry in
	    the <filename>/dev</filename> directory for the serial port if it
	    is not already there.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Specify that <command>/usr/libexec/getty</command> be run on
	    the port, and specify the appropriate
	    <replaceable>getty</replaceable> type from the
	    <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> file.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Specify the default terminal type.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Set the port to <quote>on.</quote></para>
	</step>
	      
	<step>
	  <para>Specify whether the port should be
	    <quote>secure.</quote></para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Force <command>init</command> to reread the
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>
      
      <para>As an optional step, you may wish to create a custom
	<replaceable>getty</replaceable> type for use in step 2 by making an
	entry in <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>.  This chapter does
	not explain how to do so; you are encouraged to see the
	  &man.gettytab.5; and the &man.getty.8; manual pages for more
	information.</para>
      
      <sect3 id="term-etcttys">
	<title>Adding an Entry to <filename>/etc/ttys</filename></title>

	<para>The <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file lists all of the ports
	  on your FreeBSD system where you want to allow logins.  For example,
	  the first virtual console <filename>ttyv0</filename> has an entry in
	  this file.  You can log in on the console using this entry.  This
	  file also contains entries for the other virtual consoles, serial ports,
	  and pseudo-ttys.  For a hardwired terminal, just list the serial
	  port's <filename>/dev</filename> entry without the
	  <filename>/dev</filename> part (for example, 
	  <filename>/dev/ttyv0</filename> would be listed as
	  <devicename>ttyv0</devicename>).</para>

	<para>A default FreeBSD install includes an
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file with support for the first
	  four serial ports: <filename>ttyd0</filename> through
	  <filename>ttyd3</filename>.  If you are attaching a terminal
	  to one of those ports, you do not need to add another entry.</para>

	<example id="ex-etc-ttys">
	  <title>Adding Terminal Entries to
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename></title> 

	  <para>Suppose we would like to connect two terminals to the
	    system: a Wyse-50 and an old 286 IBM PC running
	    <application>Procomm</application> terminal software
	    emulating a VT-100 terminal.  We connect the Wyse to the
	    second serial port and the 286 to the sixth serial port (a
	    port on a multiport serial card).  The corresponding
	    entries in the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file would
	    look like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyd1<co 
	      id="co-ttys-line1col1">  "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400"<co

	  <calloutlist>
	    <callout arearefs="co-ttys-line1col1">

	    <callout arearefs="co-ttys-line1col2">

	      <para>The second field is the command to execute for
	        this line, which is usually &man.getty.8;.
	        <command>getty</command> initializes and opens the
	        line, sets the speed, prompts for a user name and then
	        executes the &man.login.1; program.</para>

	      <para>The <command>getty</command> program accepts one
		(optional) parameter on its command line, the
		<replaceable>getty</replaceable> type.  A
		<replaceable>getty</replaceable> type configures
		characteristics on the terminal line, like bps rate
		and parity. The <command>getty</command> program reads
		these characteristics from the file
		<filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>.</para>

	      <para>The file <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>
		contains lots of entries for terminal lines both old
		and new.  In almost all cases, the entries that start
		with the text <literal>std</literal> will work for
		hardwired terminals. These entries ignore parity.
		There is a <literal>std</literal> entry for each bps
		rate from 110 to 115200.  Of course, you can add your
		own entries to this file. The &man.gettytab.5; manual
		page provides more information.</para>

	    </callout>

	    <callout arearefs="co-ttys-line1col3">

	      <para>The third field is the type of terminal usually

		type of terminal or software.  For hardwired
		terminals, the terminal type does not change, so you
		can put a real terminal type from the &man.termcap.5;
		database file in this field.</para>

	      <para>For our example, the Wyse-50 uses the real
		terminal type while the 286 PC running

      <title>Troubleshooting Your Connection</title>
      
      <para>Even with the most meticulous attention to detail, something could
	still go wrong while setting up a terminal.  Here is a list of
	symptoms and some suggested fixes.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>No Login Prompt Appears</title>

	<para>Make sure the terminal is plugged in and powered up. If it
	  is a personal computer acting as a terminal, make sure it is
	  running terminal emulation software on the correct serial
	  port.</para>

	<para>Make sure the cable is connected firmly to both the terminal
	  and the FreeBSD computer.  Make sure it is the right kind of
	  cable.</para>

	<para>Make sure the terminal and FreeBSD agree on the bps rate and
	  parity settings.  If you have a video display terminal, make
	  sure the contrast and brightness controls are turned up.  If it
	  is a printing terminal, make sure paper and ink are in good
	  supply.</para>

	<para>Make sure that a <command>getty</command> process is running
	  and serving the terminal.  For example, to get a list of
	  running <command>getty</command> processes with
	  <command>ps</command>, type:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ps -axww|grep getty</userinput></screen>

	<para>You should see an entry for the terminal.  For
	  example, the following display shows that a
	  <command>getty</command> is running on the second serial
	  port <literal>ttyd1</literal> and is using the
	  <literal>std.38400</literal> entry in
	  <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>:</para>

	<screen>22189  d1  Is+    0:00.03 /usr/libexec/getty std.38400 ttyd1</screen>

	<para>If no <command>getty</command> process is running, make sure
	  you have enabled the port in <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>.
	  Also remember to run <command>kill -HUP 1</command>
	  after modifying the <filename>ttys</filename> file.</para>

	<para>If the <command>getty</command> process is running
	  but the terminal still does not display a login prompt,
	  or if it displays a prompt but will not allow you to
	  type, your terminal or cable may not support hardware
	  handshaking. Try changing the entry in
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> from
	  <literal>std.38400</literal> to
	  <literal>3wire.38400</literal> remember to run
	  <command>kill -HUP 1</command> after modifying
	  <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>). The
	  <literal>3wire</literal> entry is similar to
	  <literal>std</literal>, but ignores hardware
	  handshaking. You may need to reduce the baud rate or
	  enable software flow control when using
	  <literal>3wire</literal> to prevent buffer
	  overflows.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>If Garbage Appears Instead of a Login Prompt</title>

	<para>Make sure the terminal and FreeBSD agree on the bps rate and
	  parity settings.  Check the <command>getty</command> processes
	  to make sure the
	  correct <replaceable>getty</replaceable> type is in use.  If
	  not, edit <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> and run <command>kill
	  -HUP 1</command>.</para>

      </sect3>

    <title>Dial-in Service</title>
    <indexterm><primary>dial-in service</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Configuring your FreeBSD system for dial-in service is very
      similar to connecting terminals except that you are dealing with
      modems instead of terminals.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>External vs. Internal Modems</title>

	<para>External modems seem to be more convenient for dial-up, because
	  external modems often can be semi-permanently configured via
	  parameters stored in non-volatile RAM and they usually provide
	  lighted indicators that display the state of important RS-232
	  signals.  Blinking lights impress visitors, but lights are also very
	  useful to see whether a modem is operating properly.</para>
	    
	<para>Internal modems usually lack non-volatile RAM, so their
	  configuration may be limited only to setting DIP switches.  If your
	  internal modem has any signal indicator lights, it is probably
	  difficult to view the lights when the system's cover is in
	  place.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Modems and Cables</title>
	<indexterm><primary>modem</primary></indexterm>

	<para>If you are using an external modem, then you will of
	  course need the proper cable.  A standard RS-232C serial
	  cable should suffice as long as all of the normal signals
	  are wired:</para>

            </tgroup>
          </table>

	<para>FreeBSD needs the <acronym>RTS</acronym> and
	  <acronym>CTS</acronym> signals for flow control at speeds above
	  2400&nbsp;bps, the <acronym>CD</acronym> signal to detect when a call has
	  been answered or the line has been hung up, and the
	  <acronym>DTR</acronym> signal to reset the modem after a session is
	  complete.  Some cables are wired without all of the needed signals,
	  so if you have problems, such as a login session not going away when
	  the line hangs up, you may have a problem with your cable.</para>
	    
	<para>Like other &unix; like operating systems, FreeBSD uses the
	  hardware signals to find out when a call has been answered
	  or a line has been hung up and to hangup and reset the modem
	  after a call.  FreeBSD avoids sending commands to the modem
	  or watching for status reports from the modem.  If you are
	  familiar with connecting modems to PC-based bulletin board
	  systems, this may seem awkward.</para>

	<title>Serial Interface Considerations</title>

	<para>FreeBSD supports NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550-, and NS16550A-based
	  EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.24) communications interfaces.  The 8250 and
	  16450 devices have single-character buffers.  The 16550 device
	  provides a 16-character buffer, which allows for better system
	  performance.  (Bugs in plain 16550's prevent the use of the
	  16-character buffer, so use 16550A's if possible).  Because
	  single-character-buffer devices require more work by the operating
	  system than the 16-character-buffer devices, 16550A-based serial
	  interface cards are much preferred. If the system has many active
	  serial ports or will have a heavy load, 16550A-based cards are
	  better for low-error-rate communications.</para>

      <title>Quick Overview</title>

      <indexterm><primary>getty</primary></indexterm>
      <para>As with terminals, <command>init</command> spawns a
	<command>getty</command> process for each configured serial
	port for dial-in connections.  For example, if a modem is
	attached to <filename>/dev/ttyd0</filename>, the command
	<command>ps ax</command> might show this:</para>
	  
      <screen> 4850 ??  I      0:00.09 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0</screen>
	    
      <para>When a user dials the modem's line and the modems connect, the
	<acronym>CD</acronym> (Carrier Detect) line is reported by the modem.
	The kernel
	notices that carrier has been detected and completes
	<command>getty</command>'s open of the port.  <command>getty</command>
	sends a <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt at the specified initial line
	speed.  <command>getty</command> watches to see if legitimate
	characters are received, and, in a typical configuration, if it finds
	junk (probably due to the modem's connection speed being different
	than <command>getty</command>'s speed), <command>getty</command> tries
	adjusting the line speeds until it receives reasonable
	characters.</para>
	  
      <indexterm>
        <primary><command>/usr/bin/login</command></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>After the user enters his/her login name,
	<command>getty</command> executes
	<filename>/usr/bin/login</filename>, which completes the login
	by asking for the user's password and then starting the user's
	shell.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration Files</title>
      
      <para>There are three system configuration files in the
	<filename>/etc</filename> directory that you will probably need to
	edit to allow dial-up access to your FreeBSD system.  The first,
	<filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>, contains configuration information
	for the <filename>/usr/libexec/getty</filename> daemon.  Second,
	<filename>/etc/ttys</filename> holds information that tells
	<filename>/sbin/init</filename> what <filename>tty</filename> devices
	should have <command>getty</command> processes running on them.
	Lastly, you can place port initialization commands in the
	<filename>/etc/rc.d/serial</filename> script.</para>
	  
      <para>There are two schools of thought regarding dial-up modems on &unix;.
	One group likes to configure their modems and systems so that no matter
	at what speed a remote user dials in, the local computer-to-modem
	RS-232 interface runs at a locked speed.  The benefit of this
	configuration is that the remote user always sees a system login
	prompt immediately.  The downside is that the system does not know
	what a user's true data rate is, so full-screen programs like Emacs
	will not adjust their screen-painting methods to make their response
	better for slower connections.</para>
	  
      <para>The other school configures their modems' RS-232 interface to vary
	its speed based on the remote user's connection speed.  For example,
	V.32bis (14.4&nbsp;Kbps) connections to the modem might make the modem run
	its RS-232 interface at 19.2&nbsp;Kbps, while 2400&nbsp;bps connections make the
	modem's RS-232 interface run at 2400&nbsp;bps. Because
	<command>getty</command> does not understand any particular modem's
	connection speed reporting, <command>getty</command> gives a
	<prompt>login:</prompt> message at an initial speed and watches the
	characters that come back in response.  If the user sees junk, it is
	assumed that they know they should press the
	<keycode>Enter</keycode> key until they see a recognizable
	prompt.  If the data rates do not match, <command>getty</command> sees
	anything the user types as <quote>junk</quote>, tries going to the next
	speed and gives the <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt again.  This
	procedure can continue ad nauseam, but normally only takes a keystroke
	or two before the user sees a good prompt.  Obviously, this login
	sequence does not look as clean as the former
	<quote>locked-speed</quote> method, but a user on a low-speed
	connection should receive better interactive response from full-screen
	programs.</para>

      <para>This section will try to give balanced configuration information,
	but is biased towards having the modem's data rate follow the
	connection rate.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title><filename>/etc/gettytab</filename></title>

  <indexterm>
    <primary><filename>/etc/gettytab</filename></primary>
  </indexterm>
	<para><filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> is a &man.termcap.5;-style
	  file of configuration information for &man.getty.8;.  Please see the
	    &man.gettytab.5; manual page for complete information on the
	  format of the file and the list of capabilities.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Locked-speed Config</title>
	  
	  <para>If you are locking your modem's data communications rate at a
	    particular speed, you probably will not need to make any changes
	    to <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Matching-speed Config</title>
	  
	  <para>You will need to set up an entry in
	    <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename> to give
	    <command>getty</command> information about the speeds you wish to
	    use for your modem.  If you have a 2400&nbsp;bps modem, you can
	    probably use the existing <literal>D2400</literal> entry.</para>

	<para>Configuration of the <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file
	  was covered in <xref linkend="ex-etc-ttys">.
	  Configuration for modems is similar but we must pass a
	  different argument to <command>getty</command> and specify a
	  different terminal type.  The general format for both
	  locked-speed and matching-speed configurations is:</para>
	    
	<programlisting>ttyd0   "/usr/libexec/getty <replaceable>xxx</replaceable>"   dialup on</programlisting>
	    
	<para>The first item in the above line is the device special file for
	  this entry &mdash; <literal>ttyd0</literal> means
	  <filename>/dev/ttyd0</filename> is the file that this

	    <replaceable>xxx</replaceable>"</literal>
	  (<replaceable>xxx</replaceable> will be replaced by the initial
	  <filename>gettytab</filename> capability) is the process

	  <literal>dialup</literal>, is the default terminal type.  The fourth
	  parameter, <literal>on</literal>, indicates to

	  a fifth parameter, <literal>secure</literal>, but it should only be
	  used for terminals which are physically secure (such as the system
	  console).</para>
	    
	<para>The default terminal type (<literal>dialup</literal> in the
	  example above) may depend on local preferences.
	  <literal>dialup</literal> is the traditional default terminal type
	  on dial-up lines so that users may customize their login scripts to
	  notice when the terminal is <literal>dialup</literal> and
	  automatically adjust their terminal type.  However, the author finds

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kill -HUP 1</userinput></screen>

	  to send the signal.  If this is your first time setting up the

	<sect4>
	  <title>Locked-speed Config</title>
	  
	  <para>For a locked-speed configuration, your

	    provided to <command>getty</command>.  For a modem whose port
	    speed is locked at 19.2&nbsp;Kbps, the <filename>ttys</filename> entry
	    might look like this:</para>
	      
	  <programlisting>ttyd0   "/usr/libexec/getty std.19200"   dialup on</programlisting>
	      
	  <para>If your modem is locked at a different data rate,
	    substitute the appropriate value for

	<sect4>
	  <title>Matching-speed Config</title>

	on your system.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Checking Out the FreeBSD System</title>

	<para>Hook up your modem to your FreeBSD system, boot the system, and,
	  if your modem has status indication lights, watch to see whether the
	  modem's <acronym>DTR</acronym> indicator lights when the
	  <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt appears on the system's console
	  &mdash; if it lights up, that should mean that FreeBSD has started a
	  <command>getty</command> process on the appropriate communications
	  port and is waiting for the modem to accept a call.</para>
	    
	<para>If the <acronym>DTR</acronym> indicator does not light, login to
	  the FreeBSD system through the console and issue a <command>ps
	    ax</command> to see if FreeBSD is trying to run a
	  <command>getty</command> process on the correct port. You should see
	  lines like these among the processes displayed:</para>

	<screen>  114 ??  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0
  115 ??  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd1</screen>
	    
	<para>If you see something different, like this:</para>
	  
	  <screen>  114 d0  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0</screen>
	    
	<para>and the modem has not accepted a call yet, this means that
	  <command>getty</command> has completed its open on the
	  communications port.  This could indicate a problem with the cabling
	  or a mis-configured modem, because <command>getty</command> should
	  not be able to open the communications port until
	  <acronym>CD</acronym> (carrier detect) has been asserted by the
	  modem.</para>
	    
	<para>If you do not see any <command>getty</command> processes waiting
	  to open the desired
	  <filename>ttyd<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename> port,
	  double-check your entries in <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> to see
	  if there are any mistakes there.  Also, check the log file
	  <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> to see if there are any log
	  messages from <command>init</command> or <command>getty</command>
	  regarding any problems.  If there are any messages, triple-check the
	  configuration files <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/gettytab</filename>, as well as the appropriate
	  device special files <filename>/dev/ttydN</filename>, for any

	  about once per second.  If you still do not see a

      <para>FreeBSD has the ability to boot on a system with only
	a dumb terminal on a serial port as a console.  Such a configuration
	should be useful for two classes of people:  system administrators who
	wish to install FreeBSD on machines that have no keyboard or monitor
	attached, and developers who want to debug the kernel or device
	drivers.</para>
  
      <para>As described in <xref linkend="boot">, FreeBSD employs a three stage
	bootstrap.  The first two stages are in the boot block code which is
	stored at the beginning of the FreeBSD slice on the boot disk.  The
	boot block will then load and run the boot loader
	(<filename>/boot/loader</filename>) as the third stage code.</para>
  
      <para>In order to set up the serial console you must configure the boot
	block code, the boot loader code and the kernel.</para>

    <sect2 id="serialconsole-howto">
      <title>Serial Console Configuration</title>
  
      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Prepare a serial cable.</para>
	  
	  <indexterm><primary>null-modem cable</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>You will need either a null-modem cable or a standard serial 
	    cable and a null-modem adapter.  See <xref linkend="serial-cables-ports"> for
	    a discussion on serial cables.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Unplug your keyboard.</para>
	  
	  <para>Most PC systems probe for the keyboard during the Power-On
	    Self-Test (POST) and will generate an error if the keyboard is not
	    detected.  Some machines complain loudly about the lack of a
	    keyboard and will not continue to boot until it is plugged
	    in.</para>
    
	  <para>If your computer complains about the error, but boots anyway,
	    then you do not have to do anything special.  (Some machines with
	    Phoenix BIOS installed merely say <errorname>Keyboard
	      failed</errorname> and continue to boot normally.)</para>

	  <para>If your computer refuses to boot without a keyboard attached
	    then you will have to configure the BIOS so that it ignores this
	    error (if it can).  Consult your motherboard's manual for details
	    on how to do this.</para>
	  
	  <tip>
	    <para>Set the keyboard to <quote>Not installed</quote> in the
	      BIOS setup.  You will still
	      be able to use your keyboard.  All this does is tell the BIOS
	      not to probe for a keyboard at power-on.  Your BIOS should not
	      complain if the keyboard is absent.  You can leave the
	      keyboard plugged in even with this flag set to <quote>Not
	      installed</quote> and the keyboard will still work.</para>
	  </tip>
	  
	  <note>
	    <para>If your system has a &ps2; mouse, chances are very good  that
	      you may have to unplug your mouse as well as your keyboard.
	      This is because &ps2; mice share some hardware with the keyboard
	      and leaving the mouse plugged in can fool the keyboard probe
	      into thinking the keyboard is still there.  It is said that a
	      Gateway 2000 Pentium 90&nbsp;MHz system with an AMI BIOS that behaves
	      this way.  In general, this is not a problem since the mouse is
	      not much good without the keyboard anyway.</para>
	  </note>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Plug a dumb terminal into <devicename>COM1</devicename>
	    (<devicename>sio0</devicename>).</para>
	  
	  <para>If you do not have a dumb terminal, you can use an old PC/XT
	    with a modem program, or the serial port on another &unix; box.  If
	    you do not have a <devicename>COM1</devicename>
	    (<devicename>sio0</devicename>), get one.  At this time, there is
	    no way to select a port other than <devicename>COM1</devicename>
	    for the boot blocks without recompiling the boot blocks.  If you
	    are already using <devicename>COM1</devicename> for another
	    device, you will have to temporarily remove that device and
	    install a new boot block and kernel once you get FreeBSD up and
	    running. (It is assumed that <devicename>COM1</devicename> will
	    be available on a file/compute/terminal server anyway; if you
	    really need <devicename>COM1</devicename> for something else
	    (and you cannot switch that something else to
	    <devicename>COM2</devicename> (<devicename>sio1</devicename>)),
	    then you probably should not even be bothering with all this in
	    the first place.)</para>
	</step>
    
	<step>
	  <para>Make sure the configuration file of your kernel has
	    appropriate flags set for <devicename>COM1</devicename>
	    (<devicename>sio0</devicename>).</para>
	  
	  <para>Relevant flags are:</para>

		  debugging.  See <ulink

		  <para>In FreeBSD&nbsp;4.0 or later the semantics of the

		  serial port will become the console at the same time,
		  regardless of the state of the <option>-h</option> option.
		  However, note that the dual console configuration takes  effect
		  only during the boot block is running.  Once the boot loader
		  gets control, the console specified by the
		  <option>-h</option> option becomes the only console.</para>

		<note>
		  <para>Due to space constraints in the current version of the

		    than 101 keys (and without F11 and F12  keys) may not be
		    detected.  Keyboards on some laptop computers may not be
		    properly found because of this limitation.  If this is
		    the case with your system, you have to abandon using
		    the <option>-P</option> option.  Unfortunately there is no

	  <para>The options, except for <option>-P</option>, will be passed to

	    loader will determine which of the internal video or the serial
	    port should become the console by examining the state of the
	    <option>-h</option> option alone.  This means that if you specify
	    the <option>-D</option> option but not the <option>-h</option>
	    option in <filename>/boot.config</filename>, you can use the
	    serial port as the console only during the boot block;  the boot

	  through the serial console.  Here is how to do it.</para>

	<para><literal>ttyd0</literal> through <literal>ttyd3</literal>
	  corresponds to <devicename>COM1</devicename> through
	  <devicename>COM4</devicename>.  Change <literal>off</literal> to
	  <literal>on</literal> for the desired port.  If you have changed the
	  speed of the serial port, you need to change
	  <literal>std.9600</literal> to match the current setting, e.g.
	  <literal>std.19200</literal>.</para>
  
	<para>You may also want to change the terminal type from

      <title>Changing Console from the Boot Loader</title>
      
      <para>Previous sections described how to set up the serial console by
	tweaking the boot block.  This section shows that you can specify the
	console by entering some commands and environment variables in the
	boot loader.  As the boot loader is invoked at the third stage of the
	boot process, after the boot block, the settings in the boot loader
	will override the settings in the boot block.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Setting Up the Serial Console</title>

	<para>You can easily specify the boot loader and the kernel to use the
	  serial console by writing just one line in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>:</para>
  
	<programlisting>set console="comconsole"</programlisting>
  
	<para>This will take effect regardless of the settings in the boot
	  block discussed in the previous section.</para>
  
	<para>You had better put the above line as the first line of
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> so as to see boot messages  on
	  the serial console as early as possible.</para>
  
	<para>Likewise, you can specify the internal console as:</para>

	<programlisting>set console="vidconsole"</programlisting>
  
	<para>If you do not set the boot loader environment variable
	  <envar>console</envar>, the boot loader, and subsequently the
	  kernel, will use whichever console indicated by the
	  <option>-h</option> option in the  boot block.</para>
  
	<para>In versions 3.2 or later, you may specify the console in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf.local</filename> or
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, rather than in
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>.  In this method your
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> should look like:</para>
  
	<programlisting>include /boot/loader.4th
start</programlisting>
  
	<para>Then, create <filename>/boot/loader.conf.local</filename>  and
	  put the following line there.</para>
  
	<programlisting>console=comconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>or</para>

	<programlisting>console=vidconsole</programlisting>
  
	<para>See &man.loader.conf.5; for more information.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>At the moment, the boot loader has no option equivalent to the
	    <option>-P</option> option in the boot block, and there is no
	    provision to automatically select the internal console and the
	    serial console based on the presence of the keyboard.</para>

	<title>Using a Serial Port Other Than <devicename>sio0</devicename> for
	  the Console</title>

	<para>You need to recompile the boot loader to use a serial port other
	  than <devicename>sio0</devicename> for the serial console. Follow the
	  procedure described in <xref linkend="serialconsole-com2">.</para>

      <title>Caveats</title>
      
      <para>The idea here is to allow people to set up dedicated servers  that
	require no graphics hardware or attached keyboards.  Unfortunately,
	while most systems will let you boot without a keyboard, there
	are quite a few that will not let you boot without a graphics adapter.
	Machines with AMI BIOSes can be configured to  boot with no graphics
	adapter installed simply by changing the <quote>graphics adapter</quote> setting in
	the CMOS configuration to <quote>Not installed.</quote></para>
  
      <para>However, many machines do not support this option and will refuse
	to boot if you have no display hardware in the system.  With these
	machines, you will have to leave some kind of graphics card plugged in,
	(even if it is just a junky mono board) although you will not have to
	attach a monitor. You might also try installing an AMI
	BIOS.</para>

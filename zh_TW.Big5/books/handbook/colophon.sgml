  <para>This book is the combined work of hundreds of contributors to
    <quote>The FreeBSD Documentation Project</quote>.  The text is
    authored in SGML
    according to the DocBook DTD and is formatted from SGML into many
    different presentation formats using <application>Jade</application>,
    an open source DSSSL
    engine.  Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were used with an
    additional customization layer to provide the presentation
    instructions for <application>Jade</application>.  The printed
    version of this document would not be possible without Donald
    Knuth's <application>&tex;</application> typesetting language,
    Leslie Lamport's <application>LaTeX</application>, or Sebastian
    Rahtz's <application>JadeTeX</application> macro package.</para>

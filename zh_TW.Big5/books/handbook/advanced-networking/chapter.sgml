    <title>Gateways and Routes</title>

    <indexterm><primary>routing</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>gateway</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>
    <para>For one machine to be able to find another over a network,
      there must be a mechanism in place to describe how to get from
      one to the other.  This is called
      <firstterm>routing</firstterm>.  A <quote>route</quote> is a
      defined pair of addresses: a <quote>destination</quote> and a
      <quote>gateway</quote>.  The pair indicates that if you are
      trying to get to this <emphasis>destination</emphasis>,
      communicate through this <emphasis>gateway</emphasis>.  There
      are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, and
      <quote>default</quote>.  The <quote>default route</quote> is
      used if none of the other routes apply.  We will talk a little
      bit more about default routes later on.  There are also three
      types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces (also called
      <quote>links</quote>), and Ethernet hardware addresses (MAC
      addresses).
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>An Example</title>

      <para>To illustrate different aspects of routing, we will use the
	following example from <command>netstat</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>netstat -r</userinput>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The first two lines specify the default route (which we
	will cover in the <link linkend="network-routing-default">next
	  section</link>) and the <hostid>localhost</hostid> route.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>loopback device</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The interface (<literal>Netif</literal> column) that this
	routing table specifies to use for
	<literal>localhost</literal> is <devicename>lo0</devicename>,
	also known as the loopback device.  This says to keep all
	traffic for this destination internal, rather than sending it
	out over the LAN, since it will only end up back where it
	started.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Ethernet</primary>
        <secondary>MAC address</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The next thing that stands out are the addresses beginning
	with <hostid role="mac">0:e0:</hostid>.  These are Ethernet
	hardware addresses, which are also known as MAC addresses.
	FreeBSD will automatically identify any hosts
	(<hostid>test0</hostid> in the example) on the local Ethernet
	and add a route for that host, directly to it over the
	Ethernet interface, <devicename>ed0</devicename>.  There is
	also a timeout (<literal>Expire</literal> column) associated
	with this type of route, which is used if we fail to hear from
	the host in a specific amount of time.  When this happens, the
	route to this host will be automatically deleted.  These hosts
	are identified using a mechanism known as RIP (Routing
	Information Protocol), which figures out routes to local hosts
	based upon a shortest path determination.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>
      <para>FreeBSD will also add subnet routes for the local subnet (<hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.20.30.255</hostid> is the broadcast address for the
	subnet <hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid>, and <hostid
	  role="domainname">example.com</hostid> is the domain name associated
	with that subnet).  The designation <literal>link#1</literal> refers
	to the first Ethernet card in the machine.  You will notice no
	additional interface is specified for those.</para>

      <para>Both of these groups (local network hosts and local subnets) have
	their routes automatically configured by a daemon called
	<application>routed</application>.  If this is not run, then only
	routes which are statically defined (i.e. entered explicitly) will
	exist.</para>

      <para>The <literal>host1</literal> line refers to our host, which it
	knows by Ethernet address.  Since we are the sending host, FreeBSD
	knows to use the loopback interface (<devicename>lo0</devicename>)
	rather than sending it out over the Ethernet interface.</para>

      <para>The two <literal>host2</literal> lines are an example of
	what happens when we use an &man.ifconfig.8; alias (see the
	section on Ethernet for reasons why we would do this).  The
	<literal>=&gt;</literal> symbol after the
	<devicename>lo0</devicename> interface says that not only are
	we using the loopback (since this address also refers to the
	local host), but specifically it is an alias.  Such routes
	only show up on the host that supports the alias; all other
	hosts on the local network will simply have a
	<literal>link#1</literal> line for such routes.</para>

      <para>The final line (destination subnet <hostid role="ipaddr">224</hostid>) deals
	with multicasting, which will be covered in another section.</para>

      <para>Finally, various attributes of each route can be seen in
	the <literal>Flags</literal> column.  Below is a short table
	of some of these flags and their meanings:</para>

    <sect2 id="network-routing-default">
      <title>Default Routes</title>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>When the local system needs to make a connection to a remote host,
	it checks the routing table to determine if a known path exists.  If
	the remote host falls into a subnet that we know how to reach (Cloned
	routes), then the system checks to see if it can connect along that
	interface.</para>

      <para>If all known paths fail, the system has one last option: the
	<quote>default</quote> route.  This route is a special type of gateway
	route (usually the only one present in the system), and is always
	marked with a <literal>c</literal> in the flags field.  For hosts on a
	local area network, this gateway is set to whatever machine has a
	direct connection to the outside world (whether via PPP link,
	DSL, cable modem, T1, or another network interface).</para>

      <para>If you are configuring the default route for a machine which
	itself is functioning as the gateway to the outside world, then the
	default route will be the gateway machine at your Internet Service
	Provider's (ISP) site.</para>

      <para>Let us look at an example of default routes.  This is a common
	configuration:</para>

      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata fileref="advanced-networking/net-routing">
	</imageobject>

	<textobject>
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">
[Local2]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [Local1]  &lt;--PPP--&gt; [ISP-Serv]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [T1-GW]
      </literallayout>
	</textobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The hosts <hostid>Local1</hostid> and
	<hostid>Local2</hostid> are at your site.
	<hostid>Local1</hostid> is connected to an ISP via a dial up
	PPP connection.  This PPP server computer is connected through
	a local area network to another gateway computer through an
	external interface to the ISPs Internet feed.</para>

      <para>The default routes for each of your machines will be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="3">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Gateway</entry>
	      <entry>Interface</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>

	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2</entry>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>Ethernet</entry>
	    </row>

	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW</entry>
	      <entry>PPP</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>A common question is <quote>Why (or how) would we set
	the <hostid>T1-GW</hostid> to be the default gateway for
	<hostid>Local1</hostid>, rather than the ISP server it is
	connected to?</quote>.</para>

      <para>Remember, since the PPP interface is using an address on the ISP's
	local network for your side of the connection, routes for any other
	machines on the ISP's local network will be automatically generated.
	Hence, you will already know how to reach the <hostid>T1-GW</hostid>
	machine, so there is no need for the intermediate step
	of sending traffic to the ISP server.</para>

      <para>It is common to use the address <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">X.X.X.1</hostid> as the gateway address for your local
	network.  So (using the same example), if your local class-C address
	space was <hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid> and your ISP was
	using <hostid role="ipaddr">10.9.9</hostid> then the default routes
	would be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="2">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Route</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2 (10.20.30.2)</entry>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1, 10.9.9.30)</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW (10.9.9.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>You can easily define the default route via the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.  In our example, on the
	<hostid>Local2</hostid> machine, we added the following line
	in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>defaultrouter="10.20.30.1"</programlisting>

      <para>It is also possible to do it directly from the command
	line with the &man.route.8; command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add default 10.20.30.1</userinput></screen>

      <para>For more information on manual manipulation of network
	routing tables, consult &man.route.8; manual page.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Dual Homed Hosts</title>
      <indexterm><primary>dual homed hosts</primary></indexterm>
      <para>There is one other type of configuration that we should cover, and
	that is a host that sits on two different networks.  Technically, any
	machine functioning as a gateway (in the example above, using a PPP
	connection) counts as a dual-homed host.  But the term is really only
	used to refer to a machine that sits on two local-area
	networks.</para>

      <para>In one case, the machine has two Ethernet cards, each
	having an address on the separate subnets.  Alternately, the
	machine may only have one Ethernet card, and be using
	&man.ifconfig.8; aliasing.  The former is used if two
	physically separate Ethernet networks are in use, the latter
	if there is one physical network segment, but two logically
	separate subnets.</para>

      <para>Either way, routing tables are set up so that each subnet knows
	that this machine is the defined gateway (inbound route) to the other
	subnet.  This configuration, with the machine acting as a router
	between the two subnets, is often used when we need to implement
	packet filtering or firewall security in either or both
	directions.</para>

      <para>If you want this machine to actually forward packets
        between the two interfaces, you need to tell FreeBSD to enable
        this ability.  See the next section for more details on how
	to do this.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="network-dedicated-router">
      <title>Building a Router</title>

      <indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A network router is simply a system that forwards packets
	from one interface to another.  Internet standards and good
	engineering practice prevent the FreeBSD Project from enabling
	this by default in FreeBSD.  You can enable this feature by
	changing the following variable to <literal>YES</literal> in
	&man.rc.conf.5;:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable=YES          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway</programlisting>

      <para>This option will set the &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>net.inet.ip.forwarding</varname> to
	<literal>1</literal>.  If you should need to stop routing
	temporarily, you can reset this to <literal>0</literal> temporarily.</para>

      <para>Your new router will need routes to know where to send the
	traffic.  If your network is simple enough you can use static
	routes.  FreeBSD also comes with the standard BSD routing
	daemon &man.routed.8;, which speaks RIP (both version 1 and
	version 2) and IRDP.  Support for BGP v4, OSPF v2, and other
	sophisticated routing protocols is available with the
	<filename role="package">net/zebra</filename> package.
	Commercial products such as <application>&gated;</application> are also available for more
	complex network routing solutions.</para>

	<para>In this scenario, <hostid>RouterA</hostid> is our &os;
	  machine that is acting as a router to the rest of the
	  Internet.  It has a default route set to <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid> which allows it to connect
	  with the outside world.  We will assume that
	  <hostid>RouterB</hostid> is already configured properly and
	  knows how to get wherever it needs to go.  (This is simple
	  in this picture.  Just add a default route on
	  <hostid>RouterB</hostid> using <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.1</hostid> as the gateway.)</para>

	<para>If we look at the routing table for

	<para>With the current routing table  <hostid>RouterA</hostid>
	  will not be able to reach our Internal Net 2.  It does not
	  have a route for <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.2.0/24</hostid>.  One way to alleviate
	  this is to manually add the route.  The following command
	  would add the Internal Net 2 network to
	  <hostid>RouterA</hostid>'s routing table using <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.2</hostid> as the next hop:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2</userinput></screen>

	<para>Now <hostid>RouterA</hostid> can reach any hosts on the

	  network.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Persistent Configuration</title>

	<para>The above example is perfect for configuring a static
	  route on a running system.  However, one problem is that the
	  routing information will not persist if you reboot your &os;
	  machine.  The way to handle the addition of a static route
	  is to put it in your <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	  file:</para>

	<programlisting># Add Internal Net 2 as a static route
static_routes="internalnet2"
route_internalnet2="-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</programlisting>

	<para>The <literal>static_routes</literal> configuration
	  variable is a list of strings separated by a space.  Each
	  string references to a route name.  In our above example we
	  only have one string in <literal>static_routes</literal>.
	  This string is <replaceable>internalnet2</replaceable>.  We
	  then add a configuration variable called
	  <literal>route_<replaceable>internalnet2</replaceable></literal>
	  where we put all of the configuration parameters we would
	  give to the &man.route.8; command.  For our example above we
	  would have used the command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2</userinput></screen>

	  <para>so we need <literal>"-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</literal>.</para>

	<para>As said above, we can have more than one string in
	  <literal>static_routes</literal>.  This allows us to
	  create multiple static routes.  The following lines shows
	  an example of adding static routes for the <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.0.0/24</hostid> and <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.0/24</hostid> networks on an imaginary
	  router:</para>

      <indexterm><primary>routing propagation</primary></indexterm>
      <para>We have already talked about how we define our routes to the
	outside world, but not about how the outside world finds us.</para>

      <para>We already know that routing tables can be set up so that all
	traffic for a particular address space (in our examples, a class-C
	subnet) can be sent to a particular host on that network, which will
	forward the packets inbound.</para>

      <para>When you get an address space assigned to your site, your service
	provider will set up their routing tables so that all traffic for your
	subnet will be sent down your PPP link to your site.  But how do sites
	across the country know to send to your ISP?</para>

      <para>There is a system (much like the distributed DNS information) that
	keeps track of all assigned address-spaces, and defines their point of
	connection to the Internet Backbone.  The <quote>Backbone</quote> are
	the main trunk lines that carry Internet traffic across the country,
	and around the world.  Each backbone machine has a copy of a master
	set of tables, which direct traffic for a particular network to a
	specific backbone carrier, and from there down the chain of service
	providers until it reaches your network.</para>

      <para>It is the task of your service provider to advertise to the
	backbone sites that they are the point of connection (and thus the
	path inward) for your site.  This is known as route
	propagation.</para>

      <para>Sometimes, there is a problem with routing propagation, and some

      <para>The &man.traceroute.8; command is run with the name of the remote

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>It can be very useful to be able to use a computer without the
      annoyance of having a network cable attached at all times.  FreeBSD can
      be used as a wireless client, and even as a wireless <quote>access
      point</quote>.</para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
     <title>Wireless Modes of Operation</title>
     <para>There are two different ways to configure 802.11 wireless devices:
      BSS and IBSS.</para>

     <sect3>
       <title>BSS Mode</title>
       <para>BSS mode is the mode that typically is used.  BSS mode is
        also called infrastructure mode.  In this mode, a number of
        wireless access points are connected to a wired network.  Each
        wireless network has its own name.  This name is called the
        SSID of the network.</para>

       <para>Wireless clients connect to these wireless access
        points. The IEEE 802.11 standard defines the protocol that
        wireless networks use to connect.  A wireless client can be
        tied to a specific network, when a SSID is set.  A wireless
        client can also attach to any network by not explicitly
        setting a SSID.</para>
     </sect3>

     <sect3>
       <title>IBSS Mode</title>
       <para>IBSS mode, also called ad-hoc mode, is designed for point
         to point connections.  There are actually two types of ad-hoc
         mode.  One is IBSS mode, also called ad-hoc or IEEE ad-hoc
         mode.  This mode is defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards.
         The second is called demo ad-hoc mode or Lucent ad-hoc mode
         (and sometimes, confusingly, ad-hoc mode).  This is the old,
         pre-802.11 ad-hoc mode and should only be used for legacy
	 installations.  We will not cover either of the ad-hoc modes
         further.</para>

     <sect3>
       <title>Access Points</title>

       <para>Access points are wireless networking devices that allow
        one or more wireless clients to use the device as a central
        hub.  When using an access point, all clients communicate
        through the access point.  Multiple access points are often
        used to cover a complete area such as a house, business, or
        park with a wireless network.</para>

       <para>Access points typically have multiple network
       connections: the wireless card, and one or more wired Ethernet
       adapters for connection to the rest of the network.
       </para>

       <para>Access points can either be purchased prebuilt, or you
        can build your own with FreeBSD and a supported wireless card.
        Several vendors make wireless access points and wireless cards
        with various features.</para>

       </indexterm>

       <sect4><title>Requirements</title>

         <para>In order to set up a wireless access point with
          FreeBSD, you need to have a compatible wireless card.
          Currently, only cards with the Prism chipset are
          supported. You will also need a wired network card that is
          supported by FreeBSD (this should not be difficult to find,
          FreeBSD supports a lot of different devices).  For this
          guide, we will assume you want to &man.bridge.4; all traffic
          between the wireless device and the network attached to the
          wired network card.</para>

	 <para>The hostap functionality that FreeBSD uses to implement
           the access point works best with certain versions of
           firmware.  Prism 2 cards should use firmware version 1.3.4
           or newer.  Prism 2.5 and Prism 3 cards should use firmware
           1.4.9.  Older versions of the firmware way or may not
           function correctly.  At this time, the only way to update
           cards is with &windows; firmware update utilities available
           from your card's manufacturer.</para>
       </sect4>

       <sect4>
         <title>Setting It Up</title>
         <para>First, make sure your system can see the wireless card:</para>
         <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig -a</userinput>
wi0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet6 fe80::202:2dff:fe2d:c938%wi0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
        inet 0.0.0.0 netmask 0xff000000 broadcast 255.255.255.255
        ether 00:09:2d:2d:c9:50
        media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect (DS/2Mbps)
        status: no carrier
        ssid ""
        stationname "FreeBSD Wireless node"
        channel 10 authmode OPEN powersavemode OFF powersavesleep 100
        wepmode OFF weptxkey 1</screen>

         <para>Do not worry about the details now, just make sure it shows you
          something to indicate you have a wireless card installed.
	  If you have trouble seeing the wireless interface, and you
	  are using a PC Card, you may want to check out
	  &man.pccardc.8; and &man.pccardd.8; manual pages for more
	  information.</para>

         <para>Next, you will need to load a module in order to get
          the bridging part of FreeBSD ready for the access point.
          To load the &man.bridge.4; module, simply run the
          following command:</para>

         <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload bridge</userinput></screen>

         <para>It should not have produced any errors when loading the
          module.  If it did, you may need to compile the
          &man.bridge.4; code into your kernel.  The <link
          linkend="network-bridging">Bridging</link> section of this handbook
          should be able to help you accomplish that task.</para>

         <para>Now that you have the bridging stuff done, we need to
          tell the FreeBSD kernel which interfaces to bridge together.
          We do that by using &man.sysctl.8;:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.config="wi0 xl0"</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1</userinput></screen>

	<para>On &os; versions earlier than 5.2, you
	  need to use the following options instead:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge_cfg="wi0,xl0"</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1</userinput></screen>

         <para>Now it is time for the wireless card setup.
         The following command will set the card into an access point:</para>

         <screen>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig wi0 ssid <replaceable>my_net</replaceable> channel 11 media DS/11Mbps mediaopt hostap up stationname "<replaceable>FreeBSD AP</replaceable>"</userinput>
         </screen>

         <para>The &man.ifconfig.8; line brings the
	  <devicename>wi0</devicename> interface up, sets its SSID to
	  <replaceable>my_net</replaceable>, and sets the station name to
	  <replaceable>FreeBSD AP</replaceable>.  The <option>media
	  DS/11Mbps</option> sets the card into 11Mbps mode and is
	  needed for any <option>mediaopt</option> to take effect.
	  The <option>mediaopt hostap</option> option places the
	  interface into access point mode.  The <option>channel
	  11</option> option sets the 802.11b channel to use.  The
	  &man.wicontrol.8; manual page has valid channel options for
	  your regulatory domain.
         </para>

         <para>Now you should have a complete functioning access point
          up and running.  You are encouraged to read
          &man.wicontrol.8;, &man.ifconfig.8;, and &man.wi.4; for
          further information.
         </para>

         <para>It is also suggested that you read the section on encryption that follows.</para>
       </sect4>

       <sect4>
         <title>Status Information</title>
	 <para>Once the access point is configured and operational,
	   operators will want to see the clients that are associated
	   with the access point.  At any time, the operator may type:</para>

         <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>wicontrol -l</userinput>
1 station:
00:09:b7:7b:9d:16  asid=04c0, flags=3&lt;ASSOC,AUTH&gt;, caps=1&lt;ESS&gt;, rates=f&lt;1M,2M,5.5M,11M&gt;, sig=38/15
</screen>

         <para>This shows that there is one station associated, along
           with its parameters.  The signal indicated should be used
           as a relative indication of strength only.  Its
           translation to dBm or other units varies between different
           firmware revisions.</para>
       </sect4>
     </sect3>

     <sect3>
       <title>Clients</title>

       <para>A wireless client is a system that accesses an access
       point or another client directly. </para>

       <para>Typically, wireless clients only have one network device,
       the wireless networking card.</para>

       <para>There are a few different ways to configure a wireless
        client.  These are based on the different wireless modes,
        generally BSS (infrastructure mode, which requires an access
        point), and IBSS (ad-hoc, or peer-to-peer mode).  In our
        example, we will use the most popular of the two, BSS mode, to
        talk to an access point.</para>

       <sect4>
       <title>Requirements</title>
       <para>There is only one real requirement for setting up FreeBSD as a wireless client.
        You will need a wireless card that is supported by FreeBSD.</para>
       </sect4>

       <sect4>
       <title>Setting Up a Wireless FreeBSD Client</title>

       <para>You will need to know a few things about the wireless
        network you are joining before you start.  In this example, we
        are joining a network that has a name of
        <replaceable>my_net</replaceable>, and encryption turned off.</para>

       <note><para>In this example, we are not using encryption, which
        is a dangerous situation.  In the next section, you will learn
        how to turn on encryption, why it is important to do so,
        and why some encryption technologies still do not completely
        protect you.</para></note>

       <para>Make sure your card is recognized by FreeBSD:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig -a</userinput>
wi0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet6 fe80::202:2dff:fe2d:c938%wi0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
        inet 0.0.0.0 netmask 0xff000000 broadcast 255.255.255.255
        ether 00:09:2d:2d:c9:50
        media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect (DS/2Mbps)
        status: no carrier
        ssid ""
        stationname "FreeBSD Wireless node"
        channel 10 authmode OPEN powersavemode OFF powersavesleep 100
        wepmode OFF weptxkey 1</screen>

       <para>Now, we can set the card to the correct settings for our
       network:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig wi0 inet <replaceable>192.168.0.20</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>255.255.255.0</replaceable> ssid <replaceable>my_net</replaceable></userinput></screen>

       <para>Replace <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.0.20</hostid> and
        <hostid role="netmask">255.255.255.0</hostid> with a valid IP
        address and netmask on your wired network.  Remember, our
        access point is bridging the data between the wireless
        network, and the wired network, so it will appear to the other
        devices on your network that you are on the wired network just
        as they are.</para>

       <para>Once you have done that, you should be able to ping hosts
        on the wired network just as if you were connected using a
        standard wired connection.</para>

       <para>If you are experiencing problems with your wireless
        connection, check to make sure that you are associated
        (connected) to the access point:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig wi0</userinput></screen>

       <para>should return some information, and you should see:</para>
       <screen>status: associated</screen>

       <para>If it does not show <literal>associated</literal>, then you may be out of
       range of the access point, have encryption on, or
       possibly have a configuration problem.</para>

      <title>Encryption</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>wireless networking</primary>
        <secondary>encryption</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Encryption on a wireless network is important because you
       no longer have the ability to keep the network contained in a
       well protected area.  Your wireless data will be broadcast
       across your entire neighborhood, so anyone who cares to read it
       can.  This is where encryption comes in.  By encrypting the
       data that is sent over the airwaves, you make it much more
       difficult for any interested party to grab your data right out
       of the air. </para>

     <para>The two most common ways to encrypt the data between your
      client and the access point are WEP, and &man.ipsec.4;.</para>

     <sect4>
     <title>WEP</title>
      <indexterm><primary>WEP</primary></indexterm>

      <para>WEP is an abbreviation for Wired Equivalency Protocol.
       WEP is an attempt to make wireless networks as safe and secure
       as a wired network.  Unfortunately, it has been cracked, and is
       fairly trivial to break.  This also means it is not something
       to rely on when it comes to encrypting sensitive data.  </para>

      <para>It is better than nothing, so use the following to turn on
       WEP on your new FreeBSD access point:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig wi0 inet up ssid <replaceable>my_net</replaceable> wepmode on wepkey <replaceable>0x1234567890</replaceable> media DS/11Mbps mediaopt hostap</userinput></screen>

      <para>And you can turn on WEP on a client with this command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig wi0 inet <replaceable>192.168.0.20</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>255.255.255.0</replaceable> ssid <replaceable>my_net</replaceable> wepmode on wepkey <replaceable>0x1234567890</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Note that you should replace the <replaceable>0x1234567890</replaceable> with a more unique key.</para>

     </sect4>

     <sect4>
     <title>IPsec</title>

     <para>&man.ipsec.4; is a much more robust and powerful tool for
       encrypting data across a network.  This is definitely the
       preferred way to encrypt data over a wireless network.  You can
       read more about &man.ipsec.4; security and how to implement it
       in the <link linkend="ipsec">IPsec</link> section of this
       handbook.</para>
     </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
    <title>Tools</title>

    <para>There are a small number of tools available for use in
      debugging and setting up your wireless network, and here we will
      attempt to describe some of them and what they do.</para>

    <sect4>
    <title>The <application>bsd-airtools</application> Package</title>

    <para>The <application>bsd-airtools</application> package is a
      complete toolset that includes wireless auditing tools for WEP
      key cracking, access point detection, etc.</para>

    <para>The <application>bsd-airtools</application> utilities can be
      installed from the <filename
      role="package">net/bsd-airtools</filename> port.  Information on
      installing ports can be found in <xref linkend="ports"> of this
      handbook.</para>

    <para>The program <command>dstumbler</command> is the packaged
      tool that allows for access point discovery and signal to noise
      ratio graphing.  If you are having a hard time getting your
      access point up and running, <command>dstumbler</command> may
      help you get started.</para>

    <para>To test your wireless network security, you may choose to
      use <quote>dweputils</quote> (<command>dwepcrack</command>,
      <command>dwepdump</command> and <command>dwepkeygen</command>)
      to help you determine if WEP is the right solution to your
      wireless security needs.</para>

    </sect4>

    <sect4>
    <title>The <command>wicontrol</command>, <command>ancontrol</command> and <command>raycontrol</command> Utilities</title>

    <para>These are the tools you can use to control how your wireless
      card behaves on the wireless network.  In the examples above, we
      have chosen to use &man.wicontrol.8;, since our wireless card is
      a <devicename>wi0</devicename> interface.  If you had a Cisco
      wireless device, it would come up as

    <para>The only cards that are currently supported for BSS (as an

    <title>802.11b Clients</title>

    <para>Almost all 802.11b wireless cards are currently supported
      under FreeBSD.  Most cards based on Prism, Spectrum24, Hermes,
      Aironet, and Raylink will work as a wireless network card in
      IBSS (ad-hoc, peer-to-peer, and BSS) mode.</para>

    </sect4>

    <sect4>
    <title>802.11a & 802.11g Clients</title>

    <para>The &man.ath.4; device driver supports 802.11a and 802.11g. 
      If your card is based on an Atheros chipset, you may
      be able to use this driver.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, there are still many vendors that do not
      provide schematics for their drivers to the open source
      community because they regard such information as trade
      secrets. Consequently, the developers of FreeBSD and other
      operating systems are left two choices: develop the drivers by
      a long and pain-staking process of reverse engineering or using
      the existing driver binaries available for the
      &microsoft.windows; platforms. Most developers, including those
      involved with FreeBSD, have taken the latter approach.</para>

    <para>Thanks to the contributions of Bill Paul (wpaul), as of
      FreeBSD&nbsp;5.3-RELEASE there is <quote>native</quote>
      support for the Network Driver Interface Specification
      (NDIS). The FreeBSD NDISulator (otherwise known as Project Evil)
      takes a &windows; driver binary and basically tricks it into
      thinking it is running on &windows;.  This feature is still
      relatively new, but most test cases seem to work
      adequately.</para>

<!-- We should probably omit the expanded name, and add a <see> entry

    <para>In order to use the NDISulator, you need three things:</para>

    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Kernel sources</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>&windowsxp; driver binary 
        (<filename>.SYS</filename> extension)</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>&windowsxp; driver configuration file 
        (<filename>.INF</filename> extension)</para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
 
      <para>You may need to compile the &man.ndis.4; mini port driver 
        wrapper module. As <username>root</username>:</para> 

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/modules/ndis</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make && make install</userinput></screen>

    <para>Locate the files for your specific card. Generally, they can
      be found on the included CDs or at the vendors' websites. In the
      following examples, we will use
      <filename>W32DRIVER.SYS</filename> and
      <filename>W32DRIVER.INF</filename>.</para>

    <para>The next step is to compile the driver binary into a
      loadable kernel module. To accomplish this, as
      <username>root</username>, go into the
      <filename>if_ndis</filename> module directory and copy the
      &windows; driver files into it:</para>

   <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/modules/if_ndis</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp <replaceable>/path/to/driver/W32DRIVER.SYS</replaceable> ./</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp <replaceable>/path/to/driver/W32DRIVER.INF</replaceable> ./</userinput></screen>

    <para>We will now use the <command>ndiscvt</command> utility to
      create the driver definition header
      <filename>ndis_driver_data.h</filename> to build the
      module:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ndiscvt -i <replaceable>W32DRIVER.INF</replaceable> -s <replaceable>W32DRIVER.SYS</replaceable> -o ndis_driver_data.h</userinput></screen>

    <para>The <option>-i</option> and <option>-s</option> options specify 
      the configuration and binary files, respectively. We use the 
      <option>-o ndis_driver_data.h</option> option because the 
      <filename>Makefile</filename> will be looking for this file when it 
      comes time to build the module. </para>

    <note>
      <para>Some &windows; drivers require additional files to operate. You
        may include them with <command>ndiscvt</command> by using the 
        <option>-f</option> option. Consult the &man.ndiscvt.8; manual page 
        for more information.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Finally, we can build and install the driver module:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make && make install</userinput></screen>

    <para>To use the driver, you must load the appropriate modules:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ndis</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload if_ndis</userinput></screen>

    <para>The first command loads the NDIS miniport driver wrapper,
      the second loads the actual network interface.  Check
      &man.dmesg.8; to see if there were any errors loading.  If all
      went well, you should get output resembling the
      following:</para>

    <screen>ndis0: &lt;Wireless-G PCI Adapter&gt; mem 0xf4100000-0xf4101fff irq 3 at device 8.0 on pci1

ndis0: 11g rates: 6Mbps 9Mbps 12Mbps 18Mbps 36Mbps 48Mbps 54Mbps</screen>
  
    <para>From here you can treat the <devicename>ndis0</devicename> device 
      like any other wireless device (e.g. <devicename>wi0</devicename>) and 
      consult the earlier sections of this chapter.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal networks
        operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a range of 10 meters.
        Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from portable devices such as
        cellular phones, handhelds and laptops. Unlike the other popular
        wireless technology, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth offers higher level service
        profiles, e.g. FTP-like file servers, file pushing, voice transport,
        serial line emulation, and more.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth stack in &os; is implemented using the Netgraph
        framework (see &man.netgraph.4;). A broad variety of Bluetooth USB
        dongles is supported by the &man.ng.ubt.4; driver. The Broadcom BCM2033
        chip based Bluetooth devices are supported via the &man.ubtbcmfw.4; and
        &man.ng.ubt.4; drivers. The 3Com Bluetooth PC Card 3CRWB60-A is
        supported by the &man.ng.bt3c.4; driver. Serial and UART based
        Bluetooth devices are supported via &man.sio.4;, &man.ng.h4.4;
        and &man.hcseriald.8;. This section describes the use of the USB
        Bluetooth dongle. Bluetooth support is available in &os; 5.0 and newer
        systems.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Plugging in the Device</title>
      <para>By default Bluetooth device drivers are available as kernel modules.
        Before attaching a device, you will need to load the driver into the
        kernel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ng_ubt</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the Bluetooth device is present in the system during system
        startup, load the module from
        <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>ng_ubt_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Plug in your USB dongle. The output similar to the following will
        appear on the console (or in syslog):</para>

      <screen>ubt0: vendor 0x0a12 product 0x0001, rev 1.10/5.25, addr 2

      wMaxPacketSize=49, nframes=6, buffer size=294</screen>

      <note>
	<para>The Bluetooth stack has to be started manually on &os; 6.0, and
	  on &os; 5.X before 5.5.  It is done automatically from &man.devd.8;
	  on &os; 5.5, 6.1 and newer.</para>

      <para>Copy
        <filename>/usr/share/examples/netgraph/bluetooth/rc.bluetooth</filename>
        into some convenient place, like <filename>/etc/rc.bluetooth</filename>.
        This script is used to start and stop the Bluetooth stack. It is a good
        idea to stop the stack before unplugging the device, but it is not
        (usually) fatal. When starting the stack, you will receive output similar
        to the following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.bluetooth start ubt0</userinput>

    <indexterm><primary>HCI</primary></indexterm>
    <sect2>
      <title>Host Controller Interface (HCI)</title>

      <para>Host Controller Interface (HCI) provides a command interface to the
        baseband controller and link manager, and access to hardware status and
        control registers. This interface provides a uniform method of accessing
        the Bluetooth baseband capabilities. HCI layer on the Host exchanges
        data and commands with the HCI firmware on the Bluetooth hardware.
        The Host Controller Transport Layer (i.e. physical bus) driver provides
        both HCI layers with the ability to exchange information with each
        other.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>hci</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The HCI node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth device driver node (downstream) and
        the L2CAP node (upstream). All HCI operations must be performed
        on the HCI node and not on the device driver node. Default name
        for the HCI node is <quote>devicehci</quote>.
        For more details refer to the &man.ng.hci.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>One of the most common tasks is discovery of Bluetooth devices in
        RF proximity. This operation is called <emphasis>inquiry</emphasis>.
        Inquiry and other HCI related operations are done with the
        &man.hccontrol.8; utility. The example below shows how to find out
        which Bluetooth devices are in range. You should receive the list of
        devices in a few seconds. Note that a remote device will only answer
        the inquiry if it put into <emphasis>discoverable</emphasis>
        mode.</para>

      <para><literal>BD_ADDR</literal> is unique address of a Bluetooth
        device, similar to MAC addresses of a network card. This address
        is needed for further communication with a device. It is possible
        to assign human readable name to a BD_ADDR.
        The <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hosts</filename> file contains information
        regarding the known Bluetooth hosts. The following example shows how
        to obtain human readable name that was assigned to the remote
        device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci remote_name_request 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>
BD_ADDR: 00:80:37:29:19:a4
Name: Pav's T39</screen>

      <para>If you perform an inquiry on a remote Bluetooth device, it will
        find your computer as <quote>your.host.name (ubt0)</quote>. The name
        assigned to the local device can be changed at any time.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection (only two
        Bluetooth units involved), or a point-to-multipoint connection. In the
        point-to-multipoint connection the connection is shared among several
        Bluetooth devices. The following example shows how to obtain the list
        of active baseband connections for the local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci read_connection_list</userinput>
Remote BD_ADDR    Handle Type Mode Role Encrypt Pending Queue State
00:80:37:29:19:a4     41  ACL    0 MAST    NONE       0     0 OPEN</screen>

      <para>A <emphasis>connection handle</emphasis> is useful when termination
        of the baseband connection is required. Note, that it is normally not
        required to do it by hand. The stack will automatically terminate
        inactive baseband connections.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci disconnect 41</userinput>
Connection handle: 41
Reason: Connection terminated by local host [0x16]</screen>

      <para>Refer to <command>hccontrol help</command> for a complete listing
        of available HCI commands. Most of the HCI commands do not require
        superuser privileges.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)</title>

      <para>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) provides
        connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer
        protocols with protocol multiplexing capability and segmentation and
        reassembly operation. L2CAP permits higher level protocols and
        applications to transmit and receive L2CAP data packets up to 64
        kilobytes in length.</para>

      <para>L2CAP is based around the concept of <emphasis>channels</emphasis>.
        Channel is a logical connection on top of baseband connection. Each
        channel is bound to a single protocol in a many-to-one fashion. Multiple
        channels can be bound to the same protocol, but a channel cannot be
        bound to multiple protocols. Each L2CAP packet received on a channel is
        directed to the appropriate higher level protocol. Multiple channels
        can share the same baseband connection.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>l2cap</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The L2CAP node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth HCI node (downstream) and Bluetooth sockets
        nodes (upstream). Default name for the L2CAP node is
        <quote>devicel2cap</quote>. For more details refer to the
        &man.ng.l2cap.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>A useful command is &man.l2ping.8;, which can be used to ping
        other devices. Some Bluetooth implementations might not return all of
        the data sent to them, so <literal>0 bytes</literal> in the following
        example is normal.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>l2ping -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>

0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=3 time=46.150 ms result=0</screen>

      <para>The &man.l2control.8; utility is used to perform various operations
        on L2CAP nodes. This example shows how to obtain the list of logical
        connections (channels) and the list of baseband connections for the
        local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>l2control -a 00:02:72:00:d4:1a read_channel_list</userinput>

      <para>Another diagnostic tool is &man.btsockstat.1;. It does a job
        similar to as &man.netstat.1; does, but for Bluetooth network-related
        data structures. The example below shows the same logical connection as

      <para>The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports over the
        L2CAP protocol. The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10.
        RFCOMM is a simple transport protocol, with additional provisions for
        emulating the 9 circuits of RS-232 (EIATIA-232-E) serial ports. The
        RFCOMM protocol supports up to 60 simultaneous connections (RFCOMM
        channels) between two Bluetooth devices.</para>

      <para>For the purposes of RFCOMM, a complete communication path involves
        two applications running on different devices (the communication
        endpoints) with a communication segment between them. RFCOMM is intended
        to cover applications that make use of the serial ports of the devices
        in which they reside. The communication segment is a Bluetooth link from
        one device to another (direct connect).</para>

      <para>RFCOMM is only concerned with the connection between the devices in
        the direct connect case, or between the device and a modem in the
        network case. RFCOMM can support other configurations, such as modules
        that communicate via Bluetooth wireless technology on one side and
        provide a wired interface on the other side.</para>

      <title>Pairing of Devices</title>

      <para>By default, Bluetooth communication is not authenticated, and any
        device can talk to any other device. A Bluetooth device (for example,
        cellular phone) may choose to require authentication to provide a
        particular service (for example, Dial-Up service). Bluetooth
        authentication is normally done with <emphasis>PIN codes</emphasis>.
        A PIN code is an ASCII string up to 16 characters in length. User is
        required to enter the same PIN code on both devices. Once user has
        entered the PIN code, both devices will generate a
        <emphasis>link key</emphasis>. After that the link key can be stored
        either in the devices themselves or in a persistent storage. Next time
        both devices will use previously generated link key. The described
        above procedure is called <emphasis>pairing</emphasis>. Note that if
        the link key is lost by any device then pairing must be repeated.</para>

      <para>The &man.hcsecd.8; daemon is responsible for handling of all
        Bluetooth authentication requests. The default configuration file is
        <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf</filename>. An example section for
        a cellular phone with the PIN code arbitrarily set to
        <quote>1234</quote> is shown below:</para>

      <title>Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)</title>
      <para>The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) provides the means for client
        applications to discover the existence of services provided by server
        applications as well as the attributes of those services. The attributes
        of a service include the type or class of service offered and the
        mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the service.</para>

      <para>SDP involves communication between a SDP server and a SDP client.
        The server maintains a list of service records that describe the
        characteristics of services associated with the server. Each service
        record contains information about a single service. A client may 
        retrieve information from a service record maintained by the SDP server
        by issuing a SDP request. If the client, or an application associated
        with the client, decides to use a service, it must open a separate
        connection to the service provider in order to utilize the service.
        SDP provides a mechanism for discovering services and their attributes,
        but it does not provide a mechanism for utilizing those services.</para>

      <para>Normally, a SDP client searches for services based on some desired
        characteristics of the services. However, there are times when it is
        desirable to discover which types of services are described by an SDP
        server's service records without any a priori information about the
        services. This process of looking for any offered services is called
        <emphasis>browsing</emphasis>.</para>
 
      <para>The Bluetooth SDP server &man.sdpd.8; and command line client
        &man.sdpcontrol.8; are included in the standard &os; installation.
        The following example shows how to perform a SDP browse query.</para>

      <para>... and so on. Note that each service has a list of attributes
        (RFCOMM channel for example). Depending on the service you might need to
        make a note of some of the attributes. Some Bluetooth implementations do
        not support service browsing and may return an empty list. In this case
        it is possible to search for the specific service. The example below
        shows how to search for the OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) service:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sdpd</userinput></screen>

      <para>The local server application that wants to provide Bluetooth
        service to the remote clients will register service with the local
        SDP daemon. The example of such application is &man.rfcomm.pppd.8;.
        Once started it will register Bluetooth LAN service with the local
        SDP daemon.</para>

      <para>The list of services registered with the local SDP server can be

      <para>The Dial-Up Networking (DUN) profile is mostly used with modems

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In &os; both profiles are implemented with &man.ppp.8; and
        &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; - a wrapper that converts RFCOMM Bluetooth
        connection into something PPP can operate with. Before any profile
        can be used, a new PPP label in the <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>
        must be created. Consult &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; manual page for examples.
      </para>

      <para>In the following example &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will be used to open
        RFCOMM connection to remote device with BD_ADDR 00:80:37:29:19:a4 on
        DUN RFCOMM channel. The actual RFCOMM channel number will be obtained
        from the remote device via SDP. It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel
        by hand, and in this case &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will not perform SDP
        query. Use &man.sdpcontrol.8; to find out RFCOMM
        channel on the remote device.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) Profile</title>
      <para>OBEX is a widely used protocol for simple file transfers between
        mobile devices. Its main use is in infrared communication, where it is
        used for generic file transfers between notebooks or PDAs,
        and for sending business cards or calendar entries between cellular
        phones and other devices with PIM applications.</para>

      <para>The OBEX server and client are implemented as a third-party package
        <application>obexapp</application>, which is available as
	<filename role="package">comms/obexapp</filename> port.</para>

      <para>OBEX client is used to push and/or pull objects from the OBEX server.
        An object can, for example, be a business card or an appointment.
        The OBEX client can obtain RFCOMM channel number from the remote device
        via SDP. This can be done by specifying service name instead of RFCOMM
        channel number. Supported service names are: IrMC, FTRN and OPUSH.
        It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel as a number. Below is an
        example of an OBEX session, where device information object is pulled
        from the cellular phone, and a new object (business card) is pushed
        into the phone's directory.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>obexapp -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4 -C IrMC</userinput>

      <para>In order to provide OBEX Object Push service,
        &man.sdpd.8; server must be running. A root folder, where all incoming
        objects will be stored, must be created. The default path to the root
        folder is <filename>/var/spool/obex</filename>. Finally, start OBEX
        server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The OBEX server will
        automatically register OBEX Object Push service with the local SDP
        daemon. The example below shows how to start OBEX server.</para>

      <title>Serial Port Profile (SPP)</title>
      <para>The Serial Port Profile (SPP) allows Bluetooth devices to perform
        RS232 (or similar) serial cable emulation. The scenario covered by this
        profile deals with legacy applications using Bluetooth as a cable
        replacement, through a virtual serial port abstraction.</para>

      <para>The &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; utility implements the Serial Port profile.
        A pseudo tty is used as a virtual serial port abstraction. The example
        below shows how to connect to a remote device Serial Port service.
        Note that you do not have to specify a RFCOMM channel -
        &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; can obtain it from the remote device via SDP.
        If you would like to override this, specify a RFCOMM channel on the
        command line.</para>

      <title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <sect3>
        <title>A remote device cannot connect</title>
        <para>Some older Bluetooth devices do not support role switching.
          By default, when &os; is accepting a new connection, it tries to
          perform a role switch and become master. Devices, which do not
          support this will not be able to connect. Note that role switching is
          performed when a new connection is being established, so it is not
          possible to ask the remote device if it does support role switching.
          There is a HCI option to disable role switching on the local
          side:</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Something is going wrong, can I see what exactly is happening?</title>
        <para>Yes, you can.  Use the third-party package
          <application>hcidump</application>, which is available as
	  <filename role="package">comms/hcidump</filename> port.
          The <application>hcidump</application> utility is similar to
          &man.tcpdump.1;. It can be used to display the content of the Bluetooth
          packets on the terminal and to dump the Bluetooth packets to a
          file.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <indexterm><primary>IP subnet</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>bridge</primary></indexterm>
      <para>It is sometimes useful to divide one physical network
	(such as an Ethernet segment) into two separate network
	segments without having to create IP subnets and use a router
	to connect the segments together.  A device that connects two
	networks together in this fashion is called a
	<quote>bridge</quote>.  A FreeBSD system with two network
	interface cards can act as a bridge.</para>

      <para>The bridge works by learning the MAC layer addresses
	(Ethernet addresses) of the devices on each of its network interfaces.
	It forwards traffic between two networks only when its source and
	destination are on different networks.</para>

      <para>In many respects, a bridge is like an Ethernet switch with very
	few ports.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Situations Where Bridging Is Appropriate</title>

      <para>There are two common situations in which a bridge is used
	today.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>High Traffic on a Segment</title>

	<para>Situation one is where your physical network segment is
	  overloaded with traffic, but you do not want for whatever reason to
	  subnet the network and interconnect the subnets with a
	  router.</para>

	<para>Let us consider an example of a newspaper where the Editorial and
	  Production departments are on the same subnetwork.  The Editorial
	  users all use server <hostid>A</hostid> for file service, and the Production users
	  are on server <hostid>B</hostid>.  An Ethernet network is used to connect all users together,
	  and high loads on the network are slowing things down.</para>

	<para>If the Editorial users could be segregated on one
	  network segment and the Production users on another, the two
	  network segments could be connected with a bridge.  Only the
	  network traffic destined for interfaces on the
	  <quote>other</quote> side of the bridge would be sent to the
	  other network, reducing congestion on each network
	  segment.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Filtering/Traffic Shaping Firewall</title>
	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>NAT</primary></indexterm>

	<para>The second common situation is where firewall functionality is
	  needed without network address translation (NAT).</para>

	<para>An example is a small company that is connected via DSL
	  or ISDN to their ISP.  They have a 13 globally-accessible IP
	  addresses from their ISP and have 10 PCs on their network.
	  In this situation, using a router-based firewall is
	  difficult because of subnetting issues.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>DSL</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>ISDN</primary></indexterm>
	<para>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and dropped into the
	  path just downstream of their DSL/ISDN router without any IP
	  numbering issues.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring a Bridge</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Network Interface Card Selection</title>

	<para>A bridge requires at least two network cards to function.
	  Unfortunately, not all network interface cards as of FreeBSD&nbsp;4.0
	  support bridging.  Read &man.bridge.4; for details on the cards that
	  are supported.</para>

	<para>Install and test the two network cards before continuing.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Firewall Support</title>
	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<para>If you are planning to use the bridge as a firewall, you
	  will need to add the <literal>IPFIREWALL</literal> option as
	  well.  Read <xref linkend="firewalls"> for general
	  information on configuring the bridge as a firewall.</para>

	<para>If you need to allow non-IP packets (such as ARP) to flow
	  through the bridge, there is a firewall option that
	  must be set.  This option is
	  <literal>IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT</literal>.  Note that this
	  changes the default rule for the firewall to accept any packet.
	  Make sure you know how this changes the meaning of your ruleset
	  before you set it.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Traffic Shaping Support</title>

	<para>If you want to use the bridge as a traffic shaper, you will need
	  to add the <literal>DUMMYNET</literal> option to your kernel
	  configuration.  Read &man.dummynet.4; for further
	  information.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling the Bridge</title>

      <para>Add the line:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</programlisting>

      <para>to <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> to enable the bridge at
	runtime, and the line:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.config=<replaceable>if1</replaceable>,<replaceable>if2</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>to enable bridging on the specified interfaces (replace
	<replaceable>if1</replaceable> and
	<replaceable>if2</replaceable> with the names of your two
	network interfaces).  If you want the bridged packets to be
	filtered by &man.ipfw.8;, you should add:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge.ipfw=1</programlisting>

      <para>as well.</para>

      <para>For versions prior to &os;&nbsp;5.2-RELEASE, use instead the following
	lines:</para>

      <programlisting>net.link.ether.bridge=1
net.link.ether.bridge_cfg=<replaceable>if1</replaceable>,<replaceable>if2</replaceable>
net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw=1</programlisting>

    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Other Information</title>

      <para>If you want to be able to &man.ssh.1; into the bridge from the network,
	it is correct to assign one of the network cards an IP address.  The
	consensus is that assigning both cards an address is a bad
	idea.</para>

      <para>If you have multiple bridges on your network, there cannot be more
	than one path between any two workstations.  Technically, this means
	that there is no support for spanning tree link management.</para>

      <para>A bridge can add latency to your &man.ping.8; times, especially for
        traffic from one segment to another.</para>

    <para>There are many ways to set up diskless workstations.  Many

      taste.  The following will describe variations on the setup of a complete system,
      emphasizing simplicity and compatibility with the

      following characteristics:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The diskless workstations use a shared
	  read-only <filename>/</filename> file system, and a shared
	  read-only <filename>/usr</filename>.</para>
	<para>The root file system is a copy of a

	  configuration files overridden by ones specific to diskless
	  operation or, possibly, to the workstation they belong to.</para>
	<para>The parts of the root which have to be
	  writable are overlaid with &man.mfs.8; (&os;&nbsp;4.X) or &man.md.4; (&os;&nbsp;5.X) file systems.  Any changes
	  will be lost when the system reboots.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>The kernel is transferred and loaded either with

    <caution><para>As described, this system is insecure.  It should
	live in a protected area of a network, and be untrusted by
	other hosts.</para>
    </caution>

    <para>All the information in this section has been tested
      using &os; releases 4.9-RELEASE and 5.2.1-RELEASE.  The text is

      <title>Background Information</title>

      <para>Setting up diskless workstations is both relatively
	straightforward and prone to errors.  These are sometimes
	difficult to diagnose for a number of reasons.  For example:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Compile time options may determine different behaviors at
	    runtime.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Error messages are often cryptic or totally absent.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In this context, having some knowledge of the background
	mechanisms involved is very useful to solve the problems that
	may arise.</para>

      <para>Several operations need to be performed for a successful
	bootstrap:</para>
        
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to obtain initial parameters such as its IP
	    address, executable filename, server name, root path.  This is
	    done using the <acronym>DHCP</acronym> or BOOTP protocols.
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> is a compatible extension of BOOTP, and
	    uses the same port numbers and basic packet format.</para>

	  <para>It is possible to configure a system to use only BOOTP.
	    The &man.bootpd.8; server program is included in the base &os;
	    system.</para>

	  <para>However, <acronym>DHCP</acronym> has a number of advantages
	    over BOOTP (nicer configuration files, possibility of using
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, plus many others not directly related to
	    diskless operation), and we will describe mainly a
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> configuration, with equivalent examples
	    using &man.bootpd.8; when possible.  The sample configuration will
	    use the <application>ISC DHCP</application> software package
	    (release 3.0.1.r12 was installed on the test server).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to transfer one or several programs to local
	    memory.  Either <acronym>TFTP</acronym> or <acronym>NFS</acronym>
	    are used.  The choice between <acronym>TFTP</acronym> and
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is a compile time option in several places.
	    A common source of error is to specify filenames for the wrong
	    protocol: <acronym>TFTP</acronym> typically transfers all files from
	    a single directory on the server, and would expect filenames
	    relative to this directory.  <acronym>NFS</acronym> needs absolute
	    file paths.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The possible intermediate bootstrap programs and the kernel
	    need to be initialized and executed.  There are several important
	    variations in this area:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> will load &man.pxeboot.8;, which is
		a modified version of the &os; third stage loader.  The
		&man.loader.8; will obtain most parameters necessary to system
		startup, and leave them in the kernel environment before
		transferring control.  It is possible to use a
		<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel in this case.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><application>Etherboot</application>, will directly
		load the kernel, with less preparation.  You will need to
		build a kernel with specific options.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> and <application>Etherboot</application>
	    work equally well with 4.X systems.  Because 5.X kernels
	    normally let the &man.loader.8; do more work for them,
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym> is preferred for 5.X systems.</para>

	  <para>If your <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and network cards support
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, you should probably use it.  However,
	    it is still possible to start a 5.X system with
	    <application>Etherboot</application>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Finally, the machine needs to access its file systems.
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is used in all cases.</para>

	<para>You need to create a root file system for the diskless

	  <title>Using the <filename>clone_root</filename> Script</title>

	<para>This is the quickest way to create a root file system, but

	  is located at
	  <filename>/usr/share/examples/diskless/clone_root</filename>
	  and needs customization, at least to adjust
	  the place where the file system will be created (the
	  <literal>DEST</literal> variable).</para>

	<para>Refer to the comments at the top of the script for
	    instructions.  They explain how the base file system is built,
	    and how files may be selectively overridden by versions specific
	    to diskless operation, to a subnetwork, or to an individual
	    workstation.  They also give examples for the diskless
	    <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and <filename>
	    /etc/rc.conf</filename> files.</para>

	  <para>The <filename>README</filename> files in
	    <filename>/usr/share/examples/diskless</filename> contain a lot
	    of interesting background information, but, together with the
	    other examples in the <filename>diskless</filename> directory,
	    they actually document a configuration method which is distinct
	    from the one used by <filename>clone_root</filename> and
	    the system startup scripts in
	    <filename role="directory">/etc</filename>, which is a little
	    confusing.  Use them for reference only, except if you prefer 
	    the method that they describe, in which case you will need
	    customized <filename>rc</filename> scripts.</para>

        <primary>ISDN</primary>
        <secondary>cards</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>FreeBSD's ISDN implementation supports only the DSS1/Q.931
	(or Euro-ISDN) standard using passive cards.  Starting with
	FreeBSD&nbsp;4.4, some active cards are supported where the firmware
	also supports other signaling protocols; this also includes the
	first supported Primary Rate (PRI) ISDN card.</para>

      <para>The <application>isdn4bsd</application> software allows you to connect
	to other ISDN routers using either IP over raw HDLC or by using
	synchronous PPP: either by using kernel PPP with <literal>isppp</literal>, a
	modified &man.sppp.4; driver, or by using userland &man.ppp.8;.  By using
	userland &man.ppp.8;, channel bonding of two or more ISDN
	B-channels is possible.  A telephone answering machine
	application is also available as well as many utilities such as
	a software 300 Baud modem.</para>

      <para>Some growing number of PC ISDN cards are supported under
	FreeBSD and the reports show that it is successfully used all
	over Europe and in many other parts of the world.</para>

      <para>The passive ISDN cards supported are mostly the ones with
	the Infineon (formerly Siemens) ISAC/HSCX/IPAC ISDN chipsets,
	but also ISDN cards with chips from Cologne Chip (ISA bus only),
	PCI cards with Winbond W6692 chips, some cards with the
	Tiger300/320/ISAC chipset combinations and some vendor specific
	chipset based cards such as the AVM Fritz!Card PCI V.1.0 and the
	AVM Fritz!Card PnP.</para>

      <para>Currently the active supported ISDN cards are the AVM B1
	(ISA and PCI) BRI cards and the AVM T1 PCI PRI cards.</para>

      <title>ISDN Terminal Adapters</title>

      <para>Terminal adapters (TA), are to ISDN what modems are to regular
	phone lines.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>modem</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Most TA's use the standard Hayes modem AT command set, and can be
	used as a drop in replacement for a modem.</para>

      <para>A TA will operate basically the same as a modem except connection
	and throughput speeds will be much faster than your old modem.  You
	will need to configure <link linkend="ppp">PPP</link> exactly the same
	as for a modem setup.  Make sure you set your serial speed as high as
	possible.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The main advantage of using a TA to connect to an Internet
	Provider is that you can do Dynamic PPP.  As IP address space becomes
	more and more scarce, most providers are not willing to provide you
	with a static IP anymore.  Most stand-alone routers are not able to
	accommodate dynamic IP allocation.</para>

      <para>TA's completely rely on the PPP daemon that you are running for
	their features and stability of connection.  This allows you to
	upgrade easily from using a modem to ISDN on a FreeBSD machine, if you
	already have PPP set up.  However, at the same time any problems you
	experienced with the PPP program and are going to persist.</para>

      <para>If you want maximum stability, use the kernel <link
	  linkend="ppp">PPP</link> option, not the <link
	  linkend="userppp">userland PPP</link>.</para>

      <para>The following TA's are known to work with FreeBSD:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Motorola BitSurfer and Bitsurfer Pro</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Adtran</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Most other TA's will probably work as well, TA vendors try to make
	sure their product can accept most of the standard modem AT command
	set.</para>

      <para>The real problem with external TA's is that, like modems,
	you need a good serial card in your computer.</para>

      <para>You should read the <ulink
	url="&url.articles.serial-uart;/index.html">FreeBSD Serial
	Hardware</ulink> tutorial for a detailed understanding of
	serial devices, and the differences between asynchronous and
	synchronous serial ports.</para>

      <para>A TA running off a standard PC serial port (asynchronous) limits
	you to 115.2&nbsp;Kbs, even though you have a 128&nbsp;Kbs connection.
	To fully utilize the 128&nbsp;Kbs that ISDN is capable of,
	you must move the TA to a synchronous serial card.</para>

      <para>Do not be fooled into buying an internal TA and thinking you have
	avoided the synchronous/asynchronous issue.  Internal TA's simply have
	a standard PC serial port chip built into them.  All this will do is
	save you having to buy another serial cable and find another empty
	electrical socket.</para>

      <para>A synchronous card with a TA is at least as fast as a stand-alone
	router, and with a simple 386 FreeBSD box driving it, probably more
	flexible.</para>

      <para>The choice of synchronous card/TA v.s. stand-alone router is largely a
	religious issue.  There has been some discussion of this in
	the mailing lists.  We suggest you search the <ulink
	url="&url.base;/search/index.html">archives</ulink> for
	the complete discussion.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>ISDN</primary>
	<secondary>stand-alone bridges/routers</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>ISDN bridges or routers are not at all specific to FreeBSD
	or any other operating system.  For a more complete
	description of routing and bridging technology, please refer
	to a networking reference book.</para>

      <para>In the context of this section, the terms router and bridge will
	be used interchangeably.</para>

      <para>As the cost of low end ISDN routers/bridges comes down, it
	will likely become a more and more popular choice.  An ISDN
	router is a small box that plugs directly into your local
	Ethernet network, and manages its own connection to the other
	bridge/router.  It has built in software to communicate via
	PPP and other popular protocols.</para>

      <para>A router will allow you much faster throughput than a
	standard TA, since it will be using a full synchronous ISDN
	connection.</para>

      <para>The main problem with ISDN routers and bridges is that
	interoperability between manufacturers can still be a problem.
	If you are planning to connect to an Internet provider, you
	should discuss your needs with them.</para>

      <para>If you are planning to connect two LAN segments together,
	such as your home LAN to the office LAN, this is the simplest
	lowest
	maintenance solution.  Since you are buying the equipment for
	both sides of the connection you can be assured that the link
	will work.</para>

      <para>For example to connect a home computer or branch office
	network to a head office network the following setup could be
	used:</para>

      <example>
	<title>Branch Office or Home Network</title>

      <para>One large advantage of most routers/bridges is that they allow you
	to have 2 <emphasis>separate independent</emphasis> PPP connections to
	2 separate sites at the <emphasis>same</emphasis> time.  This is not
	supported on most TA's, except for specific (usually expensive) models
	that
	have two serial ports.  Do not confuse this with channel bonding, MPP,
	etc.</para>

      <para>This can be a very useful feature if, for example, you
	have an dedicated ISDN connection at your office and would
	like to tap into it, but do not want to get another ISDN line
	at work.  A router at the office location can manage a
	dedicated B channel connection (64&nbsp;Kbps) to the Internet
	and use the other B channel for a separate data connection.
	The second B channel can be used for dial-in, dial-out or
	dynamically bonding (MPP, etc.) with the first B channel for
	more bandwidth.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>IPX/SPX</primary></indexterm>
      <para>An Ethernet bridge will also allow you to transmit more than just
	IP traffic.  You can also send IPX/SPX or whatever other protocols you

      <para>FreeBSD's Network Address Translation daemon, commonly known as

        changes the source to the local machine and re-injects these packets
        back into the outgoing IP packet stream.  &man.natd.8; does this by changing
        the source IP address and port such that when data is received back,

      <title>Setup</title>
      <para>Due to the diminishing IP space in IPv4, and the increased number
        of users on high-speed consumer lines such as cable or DSL, people are
        increasingly in need of an Internet Connection Sharing solution.  The

      <para>Each machine and interface behind the LAN should be

        and have a default gateway of the <application>natd</application> machine's internal IP
        address.</para>

      <para>For example, client <hostid>A</hostid> and
        <hostid>B</hostid> behind the LAN have IP addresses of <hostid
        role="ipaddr">192.168.0.2</hostid> and <hostid
        role="ipaddr">192.168.0.3</hostid>, while the natd machine's

        role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid>.  Client <hostid>A</hostid>
        and <hostid>B</hostid>'s default gateway must be set to that

        role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid>.  The <application>natd</application> machine's

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="network-natdport-redirection">
      <title>Port Redirection</title>

      <para>The drawback with &man.natd.8; is that the LAN clients are not accessible
        from the Internet.  Clients on the LAN can make outgoing connections to
        the world but cannot receive incoming ones.  This presents a problem
        if trying to run Internet services on one of the LAN client machines.
        A simple way around this is to redirect selected Internet ports on the
        <application>natd</application> machine to a LAN client.
      </para>

      <para>For example, an IRC server runs on client <hostid>A</hostid>, and a web server runs
        on client <hostid>B</hostid>.  For this to work properly, connections received on ports
        6667 (IRC) and 80 (web) must be redirected to the respective machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> must be passed to
        &man.natd.8; with the proper options.  The syntax is as follows:</para>
      <programlisting>     -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                 [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                 [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]</programlisting>

      <para>In the above example, the argument should be:</para>

        <programlisting>    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

      <para>
        This will redirect the proper <emphasis>tcp</emphasis> ports to the
        LAN client machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> argument can be used to indicate port
        ranges over individual ports.  For example, <replaceable>tcp
        192.168.0.2:2000-3000 2000-3000</replaceable> would redirect
        all connections received on ports 2000 to 3000 to ports 2000
        to 3000 on client <hostid>A</hostid>.</para>

      <para>These options can be used when directly running
        &man.natd.8;, placed within the
        <literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option in
        <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
	or passed via a configuration file.</para>

      <title>Address Redirection</title>
      <indexterm><primary>address redirection</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Address redirection is useful if several IP addresses are
        available, yet they must be on one machine.  With this,
        &man.natd.8; can assign each LAN client its own external IP address.
        &man.natd.8; then rewrites outgoing packets from the LAN clients
        with the proper external IP address and redirects
        all traffic incoming on that particular IP address back to
        the specific LAN client.  This is also known as static NAT.
        For example, the IP addresses <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.1</hostid>,
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.2</hostid>, and
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.3</hostid> belong to the <application>natd</application> gateway
        machine.  <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.1</hostid> can be used
        as the <application>natd</application> gateway machine's external IP address, while
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.2</hostid> and
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.3</hostid> are forwarded back to LAN
        clients <hostid>A</hostid> and <hostid>B</hostid>.</para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_address</option> syntax is as follows:</para>

    <title>IPv6</title>
    <para>IPv6 (also know as IPng <quote>IP next generation</quote>) is
      the new version of the well known IP protocol (also know as
      <acronym>IPv4</acronym>).  Like the other current *BSD systems,
      FreeBSD includes the KAME IPv6 reference implementation.
      So your FreeBSD system comes with all you will need to experiment with IPv6.
      This section focuses on getting IPv6 configured and running.</para>

    <para>In the early 1990s, people became aware of the rapidly
      diminishing address space of IPv4.  Given the expansion rate of the
      Internet there were two major concerns:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Running out of addresses.  Today this is not so much of a concern
	  anymore since private address spaces
	  (<hostid role="ipaddr">10.0.0.0/8</hostid>,
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.0.0/24</hostid>,
	  etc.) and Network Address Translation (<acronym>NAT</acronym>) are
	  being employed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Router table entries were getting too large.  This is
	  still a concern today.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>IPv6 deals with these and many other issues:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>128 bit address space.  In other words theoretically there are
	  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses
	  available.  This means there are approximately
	  6.67 * 10^27 IPv6 addresses per square meter on our planet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Routers will only store network aggregation addresses in their routing
	  tables thus reducing the average space of a routing table to 8192
	  entries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are also lots of other useful features of IPv6 such as:</para>

      <title>Background on IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>There are different types of IPv6 addresses: Unicast, Anycast and
	Multicast.</para>

      <para>Unicast addresses are the well known addresses.  A packet sent
	to a unicast address arrives exactly at the interface belonging to
	the address.</para>

      <para>Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast
	addresses but they address a group of interfaces.  The packet destined for
	an anycast address will arrive at the nearest (in router metric)
	interface.  Anycast addresses may only be used by routers.</para>

      <para>Multicast addresses identify a group of interfaces.  A packet destined
	for a multicast address will arrive at all interfaces belonging to the
	multicast group.</para>

	<note><para>The IPv4 broadcast address (usually <hostid role="ipaddr">xxx.xxx.xxx.255</hostid>) is expressed
	  by multicast addresses in IPv6.</para></note>

      <title>Reading IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>The canonical form is represented as: <hostid role="ip6addr">x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x</hostid>, each
	<quote>x</quote> being a 16 Bit hex value.  For example
	<hostid role="ip6addr">FEBC:A574:382B:23C1:AA49:4592:4EFE:9982</hostid></para>

      <para>Often an address will have long substrings of all zeros
	therefore one such substring per address can be abbreviated by <quote>::</quote>.
	Also up to three leading <quote>0</quote>s per hexquad can be omitted.
	For example <hostid role="ip6addr">fe80::1</hostid>
	corresponds to the canonical form
	<hostid role="ip6addr">fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</hostid>.</para>

      <para>A third form is to write the last 32 Bit part in the
	well known (decimal) IPv4 style with dots <quote>.</quote>
	as separators.  For example
	<hostid role="ip6addr">2002::10.0.0.1</hostid>
	corresponds to the (hexadecimal) canonical representation
	<hostid role="ip6addr">2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0a00:0001</hostid>
	which in turn is equivalent to
	writing <hostid role="ip6addr">2002::a00:1</hostid>.</para>

      <para>By now the reader should be able to understand the following:</para>

      <title>Getting Connected</title>

      <para>Currently there are four ways to connect to other IPv6 hosts and networks:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Join the experimental 6bone</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Getting an IPv6 network from your upstream provider.  Talk to your
	    Internet provider for instructions.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Tunnel via 6-to-4 (<ulink
	    url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3068.txt">RFC3068</ulink>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Use the <filename role="package">net/freenet6</filename> port if you are on a dial-up connection.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Here we will talk on how to connect to the 6bone since it currently seems
	to be the most popular way.</para>

      <para>First take a look at the <ulink url="http://www.6bone.net/">6bone</ulink> site and find a 6bone connection nearest to
	you.  Write to the responsible person and with a little bit of luck you
	will be given instructions on how to set up your connection.  Usually this
	involves setting up a GRE (gif) tunnel.</para>

      <para>Here is a typical example on setting up a &man.gif.4; tunnel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 create</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0</userinput>
gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 tunnel <replaceable>MY_IPv4_ADDR</replaceable>  <replaceable>HIS_IPv4_ADDR</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 inet6 alias <replaceable>MY_ASSIGNED_IPv6_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_ADDR</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Replace the capitalized words by the information you received from the
	upstream 6bone node.</para>

      <para>This establishes the tunnel.  Check if the tunnel is working by &man.ping6.8;
	'ing <hostid role="ip6addr">ff02::1%gif0</hostid>.  You should receive two ping replies.</para>

	<note><para>In case you are intrigued by the address <hostid role="ip6addr">ff02:1%gif0</hostid>, this is a
	  multicast address.  <literal>%gif0</literal> states that the multicast address at network
	  interface <devicename>gif0</devicename> is to be used.  Since we <command>ping</command> a multicast address the
	  other endpoint of the tunnel should reply as well.</para></note>

      <para>By now setting up a route to your 6bone uplink should be rather
	straightforward:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -inet6 default -interface gif0</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ping6 -n <replaceable>MY_UPLINK</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>traceroute6 www.jp.FreeBSD.org</userinput>

      <title>Router Advertisement and Host Auto Configuration</title>

      <para>This section will help you setup &man.rtadvd.8; to advertise the

      <programlisting>rtadvd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>It is important that you specify the interface on which to do

	<devicename>fxp0</devicename>:</para>

      <programlisting>rtadvd_interfaces="fxp0"</programlisting>

      <para>Now we must create the configuration file,
	<filename>/etc/rtadvd.conf</filename>.  Here is an example:</para>

      <programlisting>fxp0:\
	:addrs#1:addr="2001:471:1f11:246::":prefixlen#64:tc=ether:</programlisting>

      <para>Replace <devicename>fxp0</devicename> with the interface you
	are going to be using.</para>

      <para>Next, replace <hostid role="ip6addr">2001:471:1f11:246::</hostid>
	with the prefix of your allocation.</para>

      <para>If you are dedicated a <hostid role="netmask">/64</hostid> subnet
	you will not need to change anything else.  Otherwise, you will need to

    <title>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring classical IP over ATM (PVCs)</title>

      <para>Classical IP over ATM (<acronym>CLIP</acronym>) is the
	simplest method to use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
	with IP.  It can be used with
	switched connections (SVCs) and with permanent connections
	(PVCs).  This section describes how to set up a network based
	on PVCs.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Fully meshed configurations</title>

	<para>The first method to set up a <acronym>CLIP</acronym> with
	  PVCs is to connect each machine to each other machine in the
	  network via a dedicated PVC.  While this is simple to
	  configure it tends to become impractical for a larger number
	  of machines.  The example supposes that we have four
	  machines in the network, each connected to the <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> network
	  with an <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> adapter card.  The first step is the planning of
	  the IP addresses and the <acronym role="Asynchronous
	  Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> connections between the
	  machines.  We use the following:</para>

	<para>The VPI and VCI values at each end of the connection may
	  of course differ, but for simplicity we assume that they are
	  the same.  Next we need to configure the ATM interfaces on
	  each host:</para>

	<screen>hostA&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.1 up</userinput>
hostB&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.2 up</userinput>

	<para>assuming that the ATM interface is
	  <devicename>hatm0</devicename> on all hosts.  Now the PVCs
	  need to be configured on <hostid>hostA</hostid> (we assume that
	  they are already configured on the ATM switches, you need to
	  consult the manual for the switch on how to do this).</para>

	<para>Of course other traffic contracts than UBR can be used
	  given the ATM adapter supports those.  In this case the name

    		<h2>What is FreeBSD?</h2>

		      <p>FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for x86
			compatible (including Pentium&reg; and Athlon&trade;), amd64
			compatible (including Opteron&trade;, Athlon 64, and EM64T),
			ARM, IA-64, PC-98 and UltraSPARC&reg;
			architectures.  It is derived from BSD, the version of
			&unix; developed at the
			University of California, Berkeley.  It is developed
			and maintained by <a
			  href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html">a
			large team of individuals</a>. Additional <a
			  href="&base;/platforms/index.html">platforms</a> are
			in various stages of development.</p>

		      <h2>Cutting edge features</h2>

		      <p>FreeBSD offers advanced networking, performance, security
			and compatibility
			<a href="&base;/features.html">features</a>
			today which are still missing in other operating systems,
			even some of the best commercial ones.</p>

		      <h2>Powerful Internet solutions</h2>

		      <p>FreeBSD makes an ideal
			<a href="&base;/internet.html">Internet or Intranet</a>
			server. It provides robust network services under the heaviest
			loads and uses memory efficiently to maintain good response
			times for thousands of simultaneous user processes.</p>

		      <h2>Run a huge number of
			  applications</h2>

		      <p>The quality of FreeBSD combined with today's low-cost,
			high-speed PC hardware makes FreeBSD a very economical
			alternative to commercial &unix;
		        workstations.  It is well-suited
			for a great number of both desktop and server
			<a href="&base;/applications.html">applications</a>.</p>

		      <h2>Easy to install</h2>

		      <p>FreeBSD can be installed from a variety of media
			including CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, floppy disk, magnetic tape,
			an MS-DOS&reg; partition, or if you have a network
			connection, you can install it <i>directly</i> over
			anonymous FTP or NFS. All you need is a couple of
			formatted 1.44MB floppies and <a
			  href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html">these
			directions</a>.</p>

		      <h2>FreeBSD is <i>free</i></h2>

		      <p>While you might expect an operating system with these
			features to sell for a high price, FreeBSD is available
			<a href="&base;/copyright/index.html">free of charge</a>
			and comes with full source code. If you would like to
			purchase or download a copy to try out,
			<a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html">more
			  information is available</a>.</p>

		      <h2>Contributing to FreeBSD</h2>

		      <p>It is easy to contribute to FreeBSD. All you need to do
			is find a part of FreeBSD which you think could be
			improved and make those changes (carefully and cleanly)
			and submit that back to the Project by means of send-pr
			or a committer, if you know one.  This could be anything
			from documentation to artwork to source code. See the
			<a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributing/index.html">Contributing
			  to FreeBSD</a> article for more information.</p>

	 		ways to contribute to FreeBSD. The <a
			  href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org">FreeBSD
			  Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization for which

        <p><b>What are development versions of GNOME all about?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
        <p>The development versions are the packages released by the GNOME
          project that will eventually become the stable (release) versions.
	  There are three working branches of GNOME development:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>STABLE</b> - The applications and libraries in the stable
	    branch are considered "release quality," and are the versions that
	    appear in the FreeBSD ports tree.  The current stable version is
	    GNOME &gnomever;.</li>
          <li><b>DEVELOPMENT</b> - In between stable releases are development
            releases.  Traditionally, GNOME development releases have odd minor
	    numbers (e.g. 2.3, &gnomedevelver;, 2.(n*2)-1).  Development releases will
	    become stable releases, and move from alpha to beta quality during
	    their lifecycle. The development releases need testing by FreeBSD
	    users to minimize the number of surprises when the new stable
	    versions are committed to the FreeBSD CVS tree. This document is
	    about the development branch.  The current development branch
	    is GNOME &gnomedevelver;.</li>
	  <li><b>CVS</b> - Often newer-than-new, the CVS HEAD versions of GNOME
            applications and libraries are alpha quality, or often completely
            unbuildable.  The FreeBSD GNOME project pays attention to, but
	    does not track the alpha quality code.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

<!-- Q2 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
        <p><b>Should I track GNOME development versions?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
        <p>If you are looking for a stable environment, absolutely not.  Please
          only track the GNOME &gnomedevelver; branch if you wish to help identify bugs
	  and improve the FreeBSD GNOME project.  You will find little
	  sympathy if a development-quality GNOME application eats your
	  homework.</p>
      </li>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
        <p><b>How do I obtain the development versions of GNOME stuff?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
        <p><a href="mailto:marcus@FreeBSD.org">Marcus</a> maintains a
	  CVS repository where all the development versions of
	  the GNOME components for FreeBSD are housed.  Instructions for
	  how to check out the development ports module and how to merge it
	  into the FreeBSD ports tree reside on the entrance page to his
	  repository.  Please read carefully the instructions at
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi">http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi</a>.
        </p>

	<p>In order to help with bug reports, be sure to add the following
	  to <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> so that gdb back traces contain
	  useful information:</p>
<pre>
CFLAGS=	-O -g -pipe
STRIP=
</pre>
      </li>

<!-- Q4 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
        <p><b>How do I keep everything up-to-date and in sync?</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
        <p>The short answer is that you need to use the <tt>marcusmerge</tt>
	  script to merge the development tree with the FreeBSD ports tree.
	  The <tt>marcusmerge</tt> script is available
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/downloads/marcusmerge">
	  here</a>, and a man page on using the script is available
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/marcusmerge.8.html">
	  here</a>.  This script will merge the development ports tree
	  into your main ports tree.  From there, you can download
	  the <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/downloads/gnome_upgrade.sh">
	  gnome_upgrade.sh</a> script to aid in upgrading from GNOME
	  2.4 to &gnomedevelver;.  Once you are running GNOME
	  &gnomedevelver;, you can use <a
	  href="/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q6">portupgrade</a> to stay
	  up-to-date.</p>

	<p>The long answer is that keeping up-to-date with the GNOME
	  development branch is complicated.  Sometimes components change
	  in a way that makes <tt>portupgrade</tt> fail, or causes strange end results.
	  If you plan to track the development branch, it is a good idea
	  to join the
	  <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-gnome">
	  freebsd-gnome</a> mailing list, as well as to join the
	  <em>#freebsd-gnome</em> IRC channel on FreeNode (<tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>).</p>

        <p>If all of this sounds scary, or you need a desktop that
	  "Just Works," you should stick with the stable GNOME branch.</p>

        <p><b>What should I do when something does not work?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
        <p>It depends.  If you think the problem is truly a bug with the
	  GNOME component, you can report a bug using <b>bug-buddy</b> or
	  the GNOME <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">Bugzilla</a>
	  interface (<b>NOTE:</b> Evolution's Bugzilla interface can be
	  found <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">here</a>).  If you think
	  the problem lies in a FreeBSD port, or is FreeBSD-specific, send
	  email to <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>,
	  or report the problem on the <em>#freebsd-gnome</em> IRC
	  channel on FreeNode.</p>

        <p>Please forward all GNOME/Ximian bug IDs to
	  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>
	  so we can keep track of known issues.  Thanks!</p>

        <p><b>How can I help with the development versions?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
        <p>Currently, we need people to test as much as possible, and to file as
	  many good bugs as possible.  We also need people with artistic
	  skills to create some hot <a href="/gnome/screenshots.html">
	  screenshots</a>.</p>

	<p>If you like coding, and you know Perl, we <em>really</em> need
	  someone to help in porting
	  <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gst/index.html">
	  gnome-system-tools</a>.  Please contact
	  <a href="marcus@FreeBSD.org">marcus@FreeBSD.org</a> if you are
	  interested in helping with this.</p>

	    <p>Even if you don't like working directly with code, we need reports on experiences
	  upgrading from GNOME &gnomever; to GNOME &gnomedevelver;; we need information on
	  which apps are exhibiting strange behaviour; we need to know in advance everything
	  that an end-user is likely to wind up scratching his or her head about in the future.

        <p><b>What is the current state of development GNOME on FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A7 -->
        <p>Development versions of the entire GNOME &gnomedevelver; desktop
	  environment are available, and they all compile cleanly.</p>

        <p>Most of the components of <tt>x11/gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> have working
          development versions.  None of the apps that use the C++
	  bindings work yet; the C++ bindings themselves are there, but
	  none of the Fifth Toe apps will currently compile against them.</p>

	<p>Existing GNOME &gnomedevelver; users should do the
	  following to work around a file conflict with libgnome and
	  gnomecontrolcenter2 that caused key repeat to fail:</p>

	<pre>
# portupgrade -f gnomecontrolcenter2
# portupgrade -f libgnome
	</pre>

	  <p>Below is a list of known issues with GNOME &gnomever; that are
	    specific to FreeBSD.  These are not the only known issues,
	    however.  Please familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/">
	    release notes</a> which contains a
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/rnknownissues.html">
	    list</a> of known issues that affect all platforms.</p>

	  <h3>1. Upgrading from GNOME 2.4 to &gnomever; is tricky</h3>

	    <p> You should follow the
	      <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q5">
	        instructions</a> for updating to GNOME &gnomever;.  This may
	      still produce errors, however.  You may have to re-run
	      <tt>pkgdb -F</tt> after each step.  If you continue to
	      encounter errors after following the upgrade instructions,
	      log the entire upgrade procedure (you can use the <tt>-l</tt>
	      option to <tt>portupgrade</tt> to accomplish this).
	      <b>Compress</b> and send the log to
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.
	    </p>

	  <h3>2. evolution has a problem with attachments under GNOME &gnomever;</h3>

	    <p> evolution-1.4.4 has a problem with attachments under
	       GNOME &gnomever;.  To work around the problem, do the following, as root:
	    </p>
<pre>
# ln -s /usr/X11R6/share/icons/gnome/48x48/apps/gnome-unknown.png /usr/X11R6/share/gnome/pixmaps/gnome-unknown.png
</pre>

	  <p>This problem was fixed in evolution-1.4.5, and upgrading to
	    evolution-1.4.5 is probably the best solution.
	  </p>

	  <h3>3. gstreamer doesn't play nice with rhythmbox</h3>

	    <p> gstreamer-0.6.3  doesn't play nice with rhythmbox. It is
	      recommended you build rhythmbox with <tt>-DWITH_XINE</tt> for
	      now. (<b>UPDATE:</b> As of gstreamer-plugins-0.6.3_1, this
	      problem has been resolved.)
	    </p>

	  <h3>4. GDM crashes on startup</h3>

	    <p>GDM may crash on startup, especially on 5.1-RELEASE and
	      earlier.  All GDM users need to copy
	      <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/gdm/factory-gdm.conf</tt> over
	      <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/gdm/gdm.conf</tt>.  The old
	      config version from GNOME 2.2 will not work.  Users of
	      5.1-RELEASE and earlier need to read the <tt>pkg-message</tt>
	      that comes with the GDM2 port/package on how to patch OpenPAM
	      to work with GDM2.</p>

	  <h3>5. gnomemeeting fails to build</h3>

	    <p>Gnomemeeting may fail to build if you have ffmepg installed.
	      If you do, remove ffmpeg, then build gnomemeeting, then
	      reinstall ffmpeg if so desired.</p>

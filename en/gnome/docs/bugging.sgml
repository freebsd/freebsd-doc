		  <h2>1. When should I make a bug report?</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li><b><i>After</i></b> running <tt>cvsup</tt> to obtain the most
		      recent ports tree.
		    <li><b><i>After</i></b> running <tt>portupgrade&nbsp;-a</tt> to ensure
		      that all applications are up-to-date.
		    <li><b><i>After</i></b> searching through the FreeBSD GNOME
              <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html">Mailing
			  list archives</a> to see if the problem has already been
			  reported.
		    <li><b><i>After</i></b> deciding whether the problem is FreeBSD-specific,
		      or is a bug in an application that would affect all users,
			  on all operating systems.
		  </ul>

          <h2>2. What to report?</h2>

		  <p>Always report as much information as you can.  Too much
		information is always preferable to too little information.
		Superfluous information can be filtered out; developers like
		to play guessing games with code, not with bug reports.</p>

          <p>A good bug report should at least include the following
		information:</p>

          <ul>
	    <li><p>Exact version of the operating system (usually output of
	      <tt>uname -a</tt>).</p></li>
	    <li><p>List of all packages installed on your system (output of
		  <tt>pkg_info</tt>).</p></li>
	    <li><p>Your environment (output of <tt>/usr/bin/env</tt>).
	    <li><p>If you are building from ports, note approximately how
		  long it has been since you last updated your ports tree.  If
		  it has been more than a day, or if you haven't run
		  <tt>portupgrade&nbsp;-a</tt>, don't bother sending a bug report
		  until you've run <tt>cvsup</tt> and <tt>portupgrade</tt>.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Information specific for each type of breakage:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>If a port will not build, provide a full log of the
	          unsuccessful build.
			<li>If a program produces a core dump, provide a stack trace.
			<li>If an application produces unexpected behaviour, provide
			  a clear and detailed description.
		   </ul>
		 </li>
         </ul>

          <p>If you have a solution or a workaround for the problem, then include
            it into your report as well, even if you are not quite sure that
	    it is a proper fix.  Even if the fix isn't quite right, it could still
		point others in the right direction.
	  </p>

          <h2>3. Where to report?</h2>

          <p>Once you are sure it is a new problem, there are several ways
	    to report a bug in GNOME running on FreeBSD: you could
	    send a report to the
	    <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-gnome mailing
	    list</a>, file a problem report in the
	    <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#gnats">FreeBSD bug
	    reporting system</a>, send your report to the particular GNOME
	    developers via their
	    <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bug tracking system</a>, or
	    any combination of those.<p>

          <ul>
            <li><p>If the problem is FreeBSD-specific (usually, this means
			  a problem with building or upgrading), then report to the
			  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-gnome mailing
			  list</a>, or file a bug report through the
	          <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#gnats">FreeBSD bug
			  reporting system</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p>If the problem has to do with an application's
			  behaviour, report the problem directly to the applicaiton's
			  developers through the GNOME project's
	          <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bug tracking system</a></p></li>
			<li><p>If the problem is quite serious, not necessarily
			  FreeBSD-specific, <i>and</i> you have a fix available, report
			  it to both the FreeBSD GNOME team and the application's
			  developers.  This way, the application's developers can apply
			  the patch to CVS, and the FreeBSD GNOME team can apply the
			  patch immediately to the ports tree without needing to wait
			  for the next release.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>1. What to report?</h2>

          <p>The rule of the thumb is: report as much information as you
            can.  Even if there is some irrelevant information
	    developers can easily filter it out.  On the contrary, the
	    situation is much worse when there is too little information to
	    reliably track down or reproduce the problem - in this case
	    developers have to spend their time guessing and/or asking
	    originator of report to send more information.</p>

          <p>There are plenty of examples of totally useless bug reports,
	    something like <i>"Hey, gnomefoo port is broken.  I'm running
	    FreeBSD-X.Y. Please fix."</i> Needless to say, that such a report
	    is just a waste of your time, time of the appropriate developer,
	    and network bandwidth. At a bare minimum the report should
	    include the following information:</p>

          <ul>
	    <li><p>Exact version of the operating system (usually output of
	      <tt>uname -a</tt>).</p></li>
	    <li><p>List of all packages installed on your system.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Your environment (output of <tt>/usr/bin/env</tt>).
	    <li><p>If you are building from ports then the approximate time
	      when you last updated your ports tree.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Information specific for each type of breakage: full log of
	      unsuccessful build in the case when the build of the port is
	      broken, stack trace in the case of a core dump, clear and
	      detailed description of the problem when the application does
	      something unexpected, etc.  Try to put yourself into the
	      developer's shoes and in each particular case evaluate what
	      information would be necessary for them to locate the source of
	      the problem.  Do not just assume that they already know all
	      about the problem, but are just too lazy to fix it.</p></li>
          </ul>

	  <p>In addition, try to answer the following questions:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><b>What exactly is the problem?</b> : Explain the problem as
	      clearly and precisely as possible.  Try to limit the actual
	      problem description to one or two key sentences.</li>
	    <li><b>Where is the problem occurring?</b> : Include whether
	      or not you are seeing the problem during compile-time,
	      install-time, or run-time.  Also mention what machine
	      (maybe you have multiple) and in what locale (i.e. the value
	      of the <b>LANG</b> environment variable) the problem is
	      occurring.</li>
	    <li><b>When did the problem first occur?</b> : Try to isolate
	      exactly when the problem started to occur.  If this never worked,
	      or you always had a problem, say that, too.  Also mention
	      when last the problem was observed, as well as when last
	      things were working as expected (if applicable).</li>
	    <li><b>What is the magnitude of this problem?</b> : Explain if
	      the problem is getting worse, getting better, or staying the
	      same.  We realize many problems "just are," but this type of
	      information can be helpful in certain cicumstances.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Also, be prepared to answer additional questions.  Often times,
	    developers cannot solve or even diagnose a problem right off the
	    bat.  So please be understanding when asked to provide more
	    information.</p>

          <p>If you have a solution or a workaround for the problem then include
            it into your report as well, even if you are not quite sure that
	    this is a correct fix.  If it is not it could still give the
	    developer an idea about what to look at; and save them some time.
	  </p>

          <h2>2. Where to report?</h2>

	  <p>Before reporting a bug, or even sending an email to the list,
	    <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html">search</a>
	    through the FreeBSD GNOME mailing list archives to see if this
	    has already been reported.  Most of the problems reported on
	    the mailing list are repeats, and by searching you can find
	    your solution much faster.
	  </p>

          <p>Once you are sure this is a new problem, there are several ways
	    to report a bug in GNOME running on FreeBSD: you could
	    send a report to the
	    <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-gnome mailing
	    list</a>, file a problem report in the
	    <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#gnats">FreeBSD bug
	    reporting system</a>, send your report to the particular GNOME
	    developers via their
	    <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bug tracking system</a>, or
	    any combination of those.<p>

          <p>It is impossible to define guidelines that will clearly tell you
	    where to report in each particular case - you have to use your own
	    common sense, however some rules follow:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><p>If the problem is FreeBSD-specific and transient (e.g.
	      checksum mismatch, patch failure, syntax error in port's Makefile
	      etc.) then report to the <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      freebsd-gnome mailing list</a>.</p></li>
	    <li><p>If the problem is clearly not FreeBSD-specific and you have
	      no readily available solution then report to the developers of the
	      software directly (for most core GNOME components this means that
	      you need to use their Bugzilla bug tracking system).</p></li>
	    <li><p>If the problem is not FreeBSD-specific, but quite serious
	      and you have a fix available then report both to FreeBSD and
	      author's bug tracking systems, so that the appropriate port will
	      be patched and other users of FreeBSD will be able to benefit
	      from your fix, without the need to wait for the vendor's next
	      release.</p></li>
          </ul>

	  <p>Below are a list of known issues with GNOME 2.2 that are 
	    specific to FreeBSD.  They are not the only known issues,
	    however.  Please familiarize yourself with the GNOME 2.2
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.2/notes/">
	    release notes</a> which contains a 
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.2/notes/rnknownissues.html">
	    list</a> of known issues that affect all platforms.</p>

          <h3>1. notification-area-applet crashes at logout</h3>

	    <p>If you have a notification area on one of your panels, 
	      you will receive a segfault when logging out.  Bug
	      <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105421">
              105421</a> has been filed with GNOME Bugzilla.  There is no 
	      workaround other than not to use the notification area applet, 
	      or simply ignore the crash dialog.  [<b>UPDATE:</b> This is 
	      fixed as of version 2.2.0.1_1 of gnomepanel.]</p>

          <h3>2. Unable to use gst-thumbnail</h3>
	    
	    <p>If you try to use the gst-thumbnail application to 
	      thubmnail video files, you may encounter an error 
	      saying colorspace is not available.  You must rebuild
	      <tt>multimedia/gstreamer-plugins</tt> with Hermes 
	      support to correct this.  To do this, specify
	      <tt>-DWITH_HERMES</tt> when build <tt>gstreamer-plugins</tt>.
	      [<b>UPDATE:</b> As of version 0.6.0_1 of gstreamer-plugins,
	      Hermes support is enabled by default, and thus this error 
	      should no longer occur.]
	    </p>

	  <h3>3. Wireless applet does not work</h3>

	    <p>The wireless monitoring applet does not work under
	      FreeBSD.  It relies on files in the Linux proc file
	      system that do not exist under FreeBSD (even under linprocfs).
	      Work is underway to add FreeBSD Aironet support to this
	      applet.  If you're interested in helping out, contact
	      <a href="mailto:marcus@FreeBSD.org">marcus@FreeBSD.org.</a>
	      [<b>UPDATE:</b> As of version 2.2.0_1 of gnomeapplets2, 
	      support for Aironet cards is working in the 
	      wireless-applet.  As of version 2.2.2_1 of gnomeapplets2,
	      support for both Aironet and wi-driven cards is working
	      in the wireless-applet (thanks to David Jonas).]
	    </p>

	  <h3>4. gnomesystemmonitor does not display correct stats</h3>

	    <p>The gnomesystemmonitor may not list all processes or display
	      correct CPU or memory information under FreeBSD.  Patches
	      are needed to correct this problem.  If you are interested in
	      helping, please contact <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      freebsd-gnome@FreeBSD.org</a>.

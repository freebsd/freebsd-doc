<!-- Q1 -->
	    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q1"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I get GNOME 2.2 for FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME 2.2 on FreeBSD.  One way is to use 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.  Before doing either installation, you should
		first familiarize yourself with the GNOME 2.2
		<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.2/notes/">
		release notes</a>.</p>

	    <p>To install GNOME 2.2 from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg_add -r gnome2</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME 2.2 packages from the 
	      FreeBSD FTP site, and proceed to install them on your system.
	    </p>

	    <p>To build and install GNOME 2.2 from ports, you should first 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">
	        cvsup</a> the latest ports tree.  Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>For the best GNOME 2 experience, you should install from
	      ports, after adding the following macros to your 
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> file:</p>

	    <pre>
WITH_FAM=	yes
WITH_LAME=	yes
	    </pre>

	    <p><tt>WITH_FAM</tt> enables file alteration manager support
	      which allows Nautilus to update its file lists in real-time
	      as well as allows all GNOME components to detect config
	      file changes without needing to restart GNOME.  Note, in order 
	      for FAM to work properly, you also need to add the following
	      to <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> then reboot:</p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 4.x:<br>
	        <tt>portmap_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 5.x:<br>
	        <tt>rpcbind_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p><tt>WITH_LAME</tt> adds MP3 support, enabling you to play
	      MP3s directly in Nautilus.</p>

	    <p>These options may cause build errors on certain platforms, and
	      thus they are not enabled by default.</p>
	    </li>

            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
	    <p><b>GNOME 2.2 is failing to build from ports.  What do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
	    <p>The majority of GNOME 2.2 compilation problems can be solved 
	      by making sure all the necessary GNOME 2.2 components are 
	      <a href="#q5">up-to-date</a>. You may see compiler errors relating to pthreads 
	      (POSIX threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>And make sure if you are tracking -stable or -current, that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NOLIBC_R</tt> set in 
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.
	      If you still have trouble, please send email to 
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.org</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	      It is also helpful to include the config.log from the port's
	      work directory.</p>

	    <p>Ports such as <tt>devel/pth</tt> and <tt>devel/ngpt</tt> can
	      also cause pthread-related problems when compiling GNOME 2.2.
	      If you do not need these ports installed, it is recommended that
	      you remove them.
	    </p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q3 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
	    <p><b>I installed GNOME 2.2, but I am missing application foo.
	      What gives?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
	    <p>Only the core components, and a few extras, are included in the
	      <tt>gnome2</tt> package.  While you can still run 
	      <a href="#q6">GNOME 1.4 applications</a> under GNOME 2.2,
	      a number of applications have already been ported to
	      GNOME 2.2.</p>

	    <p>The applications that have been ported are included 
	      in the <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> meta-port.  
	      Note, some of these applications are still in the early 
	      development stages, and may not be very stable.</p>

	    <p>To install <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> from packages:</p>

            <pre>
# pkg_add -r gnome2-fifth-toe
            </pre>

	    <p>To install <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> from ports:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2-fifth-toe
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	  </li>

<!-- Q4 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME 1.4 to GNOME 2?</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
	    <p>Right now, the GNOME project is still very much in flux.
	      Work still must be done to the GNOME ports infrastructure in
	      order to get things working cleanly.  However, if you have
	      GNOME 1.4, and you want to upgrade to GNOME 2.2, first
	      familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.0/installation.html#upgrading">official</a> upgrade instructions from
	      the GNOME site.  Next, make sure your GNOME 1.4 ports are
	      up-to-date, then remove the following GNOME 1.4 packages from
	      the system:</p>
	    
	    <pre>
gnomecore
sawfish
gnomeapplets 
gnomemedia
gtop
libgtop
nautilus
gedit
xalf
bugbuddy
gnomeaudio
gnomegames
gnomeutils
gdm
eog
ggv
	   </pre>

	   <p>After those packages are removed, you can build GNOME 2.2 per 
	     the instructions listed above.</p>

	  </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I keep my GNOME 2.2 components and applications 
	      up-to-date?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
	    <p>I find that <tt>/usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade</tt> works really
	      well.  For example:</p>

	    <tt># portupgrade -r pkgconfig</tt>

	    <p>This will upgrade pkgconfig and every other port that depends 
	      on it (that needs updating).</p>

	    <p>However, sometimes so much changes that it becomes 
	      necessary to do a little housekeeping first. In that case, this 
	      usually works:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_delete -rf pkgconfig\*
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>These steps will remove <b>all</b> the GNOME 1 and 2 components 
	      and applications from your machine, but only reinstalls the
	      GNOME 2 desktop.  You should be aware, that if it comes to
	      this, you will need to reinstall your applications after 
	      reinstalling the desktop.  Fortunately, this extreme measure
	      is only rarely needed.
	    </p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q6 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q6"></a>
	    <p><b>Can I install GNOME 1.4 applications under GNOME 2.2?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
	    <p>Sure!  Note, however, certain ports assume you are 
	      running either the GNOME 1 or GNOME 2 desktop.  That is,
	      they rely on certain desktop features such as the 
	      gnome-panel.  To ensure that a port does not overwrite
	      your current preferred desktop, set the 
	      <tt>GNOME_DESKTOP_VERSION</tt> variable to either 1 or 2 
	      (depending on your desktop version of choice) in 
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>.  Then just install the GNOME port
	      you wish.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q7 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q7"></a>
	    <p><b>Where can I get more themes for GNOME 2.2?</b></p>
<!-- A7 -->
	    <p>The website <a href="http://art.gnome.org"> 
	      art.gnome.org</a> has been setup as a general GNOME theme
	      repository.  They offer some gtk+-2, metacity, sawfish,
	      nautilus, icon, and gdm themes, as well as some backgrounds.</p>

	    <p>A new theme site called <a href="http://www.themedepot.org">
	      The Theme Depot</a> has just been launched.  This site contains
	      themes for GNOME 2 as well as KDE and quite a few window
	      managers.
	    </p>

	    <p>A good site for some cool GNOME icons (some stock, some new)
	      is jimmac's <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3"> 
	      Icons</a> site.</p>

	    <p>See the instructions on the website for installing the themes.
	      If you feel inclined to port a few of them, you will not be
	      turned away ;-).</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q8 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q8"></a>
	    <p><b>What window managers work well with GNOME 2.2?</b></p>
<!-- A8 -->
	    <p>The <tt>gnome2</tt> meta-port installs the 
	      metacity window manager by default.  Another popular window
	      manager that works well with GNOME 2.2 is 
	      <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">sawfish</a>.  Sawfish
	      is distributed as part of the <tt>x11/gnome2-fifth-toe</tt>
	      meta-port.

	    <p>To switch between metacity and sawfish in GNOME 2, you will need
	      to do the following:</p>

<pre>
killall metacity; sawfish &
gnome-session-save --gui
</pre>
	    <p>The <tt>gnome-session-save</tt> is important.  Without it, the
	      window manager will revert back to the one previously configured
	      upon next login.  To switch back, simply reverse sawfish and 
	      metacity.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q9 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q9"></a>
	    <p><b>Does GNOME 2.2 support anti-aliased fonts?</b></p>
<!-- A9 -->
		<p>Yes!  Anti-aliasing requires XFree86 4.x with 
		  freetype2 support.  To add freetype2 support to X, make
		  sure you have the following modules loaded in your 
		  XF86Config file under the Modules section:</p>

		<pre>
Load	"freetype"
Load	"type1"
		</pre>
		
		<p>Then, simply checkout the Fonts capplet under
		  Applications->Desktop Preferences.  If you want a good set
		  of TrueType starter fonts, install the 
		  <tt>x11-fonts/webfonts</tt> port.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, after adding new fonts to the system, it is
		  necessary to teach fontconfig about them.  If you find that
		  newly added fonts are not made available even after 
		  restarting GNOME 2, run the following command as root.</p>

		<pre>
# fc-cache -f -v
		</pre>

		<p>If you have any questions, please send them to 
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q10 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q10"></a>
	    <p><b>How can I control what fonts are anti-aliased?</b></p>
<!-- A10 -->
		<p>GNOME 2.2 makes use of Xft and fontconfig to handle 
		  anti-aliasing.  Fontconfig is a very powerful XML-based
		  font configuration package.  You can create a
		  <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file that controls virtually
		  every aspect of fontconfig.  For example, if you do not
		  want to anti-alias fonts smaller than 16 point, create
		  a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> with the following contents:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="size" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
                </pre>

                <p>Refer to fonts-conf(5) for more information.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q11 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q11"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I edit my GNOME 2 menus?</b></p>
<!-- A11 -->
	    <p>You need to use Nautilus to edit your GNOME 2 menus.  If you
	      want to edit any menu other than Favorites, you must be
	      root.</p>

	    <p>To edit the menus, launch Nautilus, and enter the URL 
	      <b>applications:///</b>.  From there you should be able to edit
	      your entire application menu.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q12 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q12"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I use GTK+ 2 resource settings for GTK+ 2 applications
	      when not in a GNOME environment?</b></p>
<!-- A12 -->
	    <p> GNOME 2 applications get their GTK+ 2 resources from themes and
	      the corresponding theme engine.  If you would rather run your
	      GTK+ 2 applications in a non-GNOME environment then you will
	      need to create a file named <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>.</p>
		<p> To use the widgets from a GTK+ 2 theme when in a non-GNOME
		  environment, simply <tt>include</tt> the theme's
		  <tt>gtk-2.0/gtkrc</tt> in your <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>. For example:

		  <pre>include "/usr/X11R6/share/themes/Crux/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"</pre>
		<p> If you prefer, you can use the same GTK+ 1.2 theme for both
		  GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2 applications, which will give your GTK+
		  programs a consistent look. For the most part, you can transfer
		  your settings from your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> file (used for
		  GTK+ 1.2) with a couple of caveats.</p>

	      <ol>
	        <li> If you have any theme engine references, you will have
		  to make sure there is a corresponding GTK+ 2 theme engine.  
		  Otherwise, remove the engine entries.</li>
		<li> The default font specification should be outside of
		  any <tt>style</tt> blocks and should be specified with
		  the <tt>gtk-font-name</tt> keyword.  For example:

		  <pre>gtk-font-name = "Verdana 11"</pre>
		</li>
              </ol>

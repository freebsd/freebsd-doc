	    <p><b>How do I get GNOME &gnomever; for FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME &gnomever; on FreeBSD.  One way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.  Before doing either installation, you should
		first familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
		<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/">
		release notes</a>.</p>

	    <p>To install GNOME &gnomever; from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg_add -r gnome2</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME &gnomever; packages from the
	      FreeBSD FTP site, and proceed to install them on your system.
	    </p>

	    <p>To build and install GNOME &gnomever; from ports, you should first
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">
	        cvsup</a> the latest ports tree.  Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>For the best GNOME &gnomever; experience, you should install from
	      ports, after adding the following macros to your
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> file:</p>

	    <pre>
WITH_FAM=	yes
WITH_LAME=	yes
	    </pre>

	    <p><tt>WITH_FAM</tt> enables file alteration manager support
	      which allows Nautilus to update its file lists in real-time
	      as well as allows all GNOME components to detect config
	      file changes without needing to restart GNOME.  Note that
	      for FAM to work properly, you also need to add the following
	      to <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> then reboot:</p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 4.x:<br>
	        <tt>portmap_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 5.x:<br>
	        <tt>rpcbind_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p>If you install GNOME from packages, or you build it from
	        ports without FAM enabled, all you need to do to enable FAM
		support is rebuild <tt>devel/gnomevfs2</tt> after adding
		<tt>WITH_FAM</tt> to <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>.</p>

	      <p><tt>WITH_LAME</tt> adds MP3 support, enabling you to play
	        MP3s directly in Nautilus.  If you install GNOME from packages
	        or build it from ports without LAME support enabled, all
	        you need to do to enable LAME support is rebuild
	        <tt>multimedia/nautilus-media</tt> after adding
	        <tt>WITH_LAME</tt> to <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>.</p>

	    <p>These options may cause build errors on certain platforms, and
	      thus they are not enabled by default.</p>

	    <p>Once you have the GNOME &gnomever; desktop installed,
	      GNOME &gnomever; can be started by adding the following line
	      to <tt>~/.xsession</tt> or <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt>, as appropriate:</p>

	    <pre>
exec gnome-session
	    </pre>

	    </li>

	    <p><b>GNOME &gnomever; is failing to build from ports.  What do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
	    <p>The majority of GNOME &gnomever; compilation problems can be solved
	      by making sure all the necessary GNOME &gnomever; components are
	      <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a>.</p>

	    <p>In general, when a GNOME &gnomever; component is not up-to-date,
	      you will see an error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
checking for libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0 libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1
gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2 libglade-2.0...
configure: error: Library requirements (libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0
libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1 gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2
libglade-2.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
	      </pre>

	    <p>Simply keeping your ports tree <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a> will
	      prevent these errors.</p>

	    <p>If the <tt>pkg-config</tt> program is out-of-date, you may see
	      a configure error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
configure: error: *** pkg-config too old; version 0.14 or better required.
	      </pre>

	      <p>While this may be buried in some other text, the error is
	        very straight-forward: you need to upgrade pkg-config.
		The pkg-config application is found in the
		<tt>devel/pkgconfig</tt> port.  By updating this port to
		the latest version, this error will go away.</p>

	      <p>You may see compiler errors relating to pthreads
	      (&posix; threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>If you are tracking -stable or -current, make sure that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NOLIBC_R</tt> set in
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.
	      If you still have trouble, please send email to
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.org</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	      It is also helpful to include the config.log from the port's
	      work directory.</p>

	    <p>Ports such as <tt>devel/pth</tt> and <tt>devel/ngpt</tt> can
	      also cause pthread-related problems when compiling GNOME &gnomever;.
	      If you do not need these ports installed, it is recommended that
	      you remove them.
	    </p>

		<p>A common source of build failures is the existence of multiple versions
		  of the same library.  This can happen if you have two different versions of
		  a port installed, or can even happen through normal <tt>portupgrade</tt> use.
		  You can back up the libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt> and remove
		  them, and then run <tt>portupgrade -u -rf pkgconfig</tt>.  This will force a
		  rebuild of all GNOME-related apps (and a fair number of other apps) without
		  retaining old versions of libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt>.

	    <p><b>I installed GNOME &gnomever;, but I am missing application foo.
	      What gives?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
	    <p>Only the core desktop is included in the
	      <tt>gnome2</tt> package.  Here are some other GNOME
	      meta-ports that offer convenient groupings of popular GNOME 2
	      software.</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>The <b>GNOME 2 Fifth Toe</b> (<tt>x11/gnome2-fifth-toe</tt>)
	        consists of stable GNOME 2 applications that many users
		expect to find in a functional desktop environment.  This
		includes image manipulation applications, chat and instant
		messenger applications, and music and multimedia players</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME 2 Hacker Tools</b>
	        (<tt>devel/gnome2-hacker-tools</tt>) consists of applications
		developers would need to create and maintain GNOME software
		projects.  This includes IDEs, interface builders, ``hacker''
		editors, and code generation tools.</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME 2 Office</b> (<tt>editors/gnome2-office</tt>)
	        consists of applications that are commonly found in office or
		productivity suites.  This includes a spreadsheet application,
		word processor, project management application, database
		access application, groupware suite, and diagramming
		application.</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME 2 Power Tools</b>
	        (<tt>x11/gnome2-power-tools</tt>) consists of utilities
	        and applets for the technically-minded GNOME user.  It
	        also contains many useful add-on utilities for some of
	        the applications found in the Desktop and Fifth
	        Toe.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>To install any of these from packages:</p>

            <pre>
# pkg_add -r <em>meta-port</em>
            </pre>

	    <p>For example, to install the GNOME 2 Fifth Toe from packages:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_add -r gnome2-fifth-toe
	    </pre>

	    <p>To install any of these from ports:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/<em>category</em>/<em>meta-port</em>
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>For example, to install the GNOME 2 Fifth Toe from ports:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2-fifth-toe
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME 1.4 to GNOME 2?</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
	    <p>If you have
	      GNOME 1.4, and you want to upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;, first
	      familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.0/installation.html#upgrading">official</a> upgrade instructions from
	      the GNOME site.  Make sure your GNOME 1.4 ports are
	      up-to-date, and then remove the following GNOME 1.4 packages from
	      the system:</p>

	    <pre>
gnomecore
sawfish
gnomeapplets
gnomemedia
gtop
libgtop
nautilus
gedit
xalf
bugbuddy
gnomeaudio
gnomegames
gnomeutils
gdm
eog
ggv
	   </pre>

	   <p>After those packages are removed, you can build GNOME &gnomever; as per
	     the <a href="#q1">instructions listed above</a>.</p>

	  </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME 2.2 to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
	    <p>We recommend that you use <tt>/usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade</tt>
	      for this purpose.  The following will do the job well:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkgdb -F
(answer yes to all prompts; note that you might wish
to run the above command after each step below)
# portupgrade ORBit2 libbonobo
# portupgrade -rf -m BATCH=yes atk
# portupgrade -R -m BATCH=yes gnome2
	    </pre>

	  </li>

<!-- Q6 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q6"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I keep my GNOME &gnomever; components and applications
	      up-to-date?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
		<p>You are emphatically encouraged to use <tt>portupgrade</tt> --
		  and <em>only</em> <tt>portupgrade</tt> -- to keep your GNOME
		  &gnomever; components and applications up-to-date.</p>

		<p>Once you have updated your ports tree (presumably with
		  <tt>cvsup</tt>), the following two simple commands will update
		  what needs to be updated, and will prevent inconsistencies:</p>

		<pre>
# pkgdb -F
# portupgrade -a
		</pre>

	    <p>Despite consistent utilization of <tt>portupgrade</tt>, if
		  it seems like everything is refusing to build with everything
		  else, you might save yourself a headache or three by removing
		  all your GNOME apps and reinstalling them (your data files will
		  remain untouched).  To do this, follow these commands:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkgdb -F
# pkg_delete -rf pkgconfig\*
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>After running the above commands, you will have to reinstall all
		  the GNOME applications you desire.  This process sounds painful,
		  but it is actually a great way to clear cruft off of your system.
		  Just install applications as you need them, and you'll be surprised
		  how much disk space you have reclaimed.  A full rebuild does take
		  a significant amount of time; fortunately, this measure is only
		  rarely needed.</p>

<!-- Q7 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q7"></a>
	    <p><b>Can I install GNOME 1.4 applications under GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A7 -->
	    <p>GNOME 1.4 ports will run well under the GNOME 2 desktop. Older
	      applications that were incompatible with the GNOME 2 desktop
	      have been removed from the ports tree, so it should be safe to
	      run any GNOME application in the ports tree under the GNOME 2
	      desktop.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q8 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q8"></a>
	    <p><b>Where can I get more themes for GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A8 -->
	    <p>The website <a href="http://art.gnome.org">
	      art.gnome.org</a> has been setup as a general GNOME theme
	      repository.  They offer some gtk+-2, metacity, sawfish,
	      nautilus, icon, and gdm themes, as well as some backgrounds.</p>

	    <p>A new theme site called <a href="http://www.themedepot.org">
	      The Theme Depot</a> has just been launched.  This site contains
	      themes for GNOME 2 as well as KDE and quite a few window
	      managers.
	    </p>

	    <p>Freshmeat.net has a themes archive at
	      <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net">themes.freshmeat.net</a>,
	      which contains themes and backgrounds for many window managers,
	      theme engines, and desktop environments.  This site grew out of
	      the old themes.org.
	    </p>

	    <p>A good site for some cool GNOME icons (some stock, some new)
	      is jimmac's <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3">
	      Icons</a> site.</p>

	    <p>See the instructions on the website for installing the themes.
	      If you feel inclined to port a few of them, you will not be
	      turned away ;-).</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q9 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q9"></a>
	    <p><b>What window managers work well with GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A9 -->
	    <p>The <tt>gnome2</tt> meta-port installs the
	      metacity window manager by default.  Another popular window
	      manager that works well with GNOME &gnomever; is
	      <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">sawfish</a>.  Sawfish
	      can be found in <tt>x11-wm/sawfish2</tt>.</p>

	    <p>To switch between metacity and sawfish in GNOME 2, you will need
	      to do the following:</p>

<pre>
killall metacity; sawfish &
gnome-session-save --gui
</pre>
	    <p>The <tt>gnome-session-save</tt> is important.  Without it, the
	      window manager will revert back to the one previously configured
	      upon next login.  To switch back, simply reverse sawfish and
	      metacity.</p>

		<p>If you have gotten the GNOME &gnomever; desktop working under an
		  alternative window manager, please take a screenshot and
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">send it to us</a>!
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q10 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q10"></a>
	    <p><b>Does GNOME &gnomever; support anti-aliased fonts?</b></p>
<!-- A10 -->
		<p>Yes!  Anti-aliasing requires XFree86 4.x with
		  freetype2 support.  To add freetype2 support to X, make
		  sure you have the following modules loaded in your
		  XF86Config file under the Modules section:</p>

		<pre>
Load	"freetype"
Load	"type1"
		</pre>

		<p>Then, simply check out the Fonts capplet under
		  Applications->Desktop Preferences.  If you want a good set
		  of TrueType starter fonts, install the
		  <tt>x11-fonts/webfonts</tt> port.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, after adding new fonts to the system, it is
		  necessary to teach fontconfig about them.  If you find that
		  newly added fonts are not made available even after
		  restarting GNOME 2, run the following command as root:</p>

		<pre>
# fc-cache -f -v
		</pre>

		<p>If you have any questions, please send them to
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q11 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q11"></a>
	    <p><b>How can I control what fonts are anti-aliased?</b></p>
<!-- A11 -->
		<p>GNOME &gnomever; makes use of Xft and fontconfig to handle
		  anti-aliasing.  Fontconfig is a very powerful XML-based
		  font configuration package.  You can create a
		  <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file that controls virtually
		  every aspect of fontconfig.  For example, if you do not
		  want to anti-alias fonts smaller than 16 point, create
		  a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> with the following contents:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="size" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
                </pre>

                <p>Refer to fonts-conf(5) for more information.</p>

<!-- Q12 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q12"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I edit my GNOME 2 menus?</b></p>
<!-- A12 -->
	    <p>You need to use Nautilus to edit your GNOME 2 menus.  If you
	      want to edit any menu other than Favorites, you must be
	      root.</p>

	    <p>To edit the menus, launch Nautilus, and enter the URL
	      <b>applications:///</b>.  From there you should be able to edit
	      your entire application menu.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q13 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q13"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I use GTK+ 2 resource settings for GTK+ 2 applications
	      when not in a GNOME environment?</b></p>
<!-- A13 -->
	    <p> GNOME 2 applications get their GTK+ 2 resources from themes and
	      the corresponding theme engine.  If you would rather run your
	      GTK+ 2 applications in a non-GNOME environment then you will
	      need to create a file named <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>.</p>
		<p> To use the widgets from a GTK+ 2 theme when in a non-GNOME
		  environment, simply <tt>include</tt> the theme's
		  <tt>gtk-2.0/gtkrc</tt> in your <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>. For example:

		  <pre>include "/usr/X11R6/share/themes/Crux/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"</pre>
		<p> If you prefer, you can use the same GTK+ 1.2 theme for both
		  GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2 applications, which will give your GTK+
		  programs a consistent look. For the most part, you can transfer
		  your settings from your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> file (used for
		  GTK+ 1.2) with a couple of caveats.</p>

	    <p><b>Nautilus-cd-burner does not let me burn CDs.  How can I
	      fix this?</b></p>
<!-- A15 -->
	    <p>Nautilus-cd-burner cannot write to CD/DVD burners unless support
	      for those devices is enabled in the kernel, and the
	      permissions on the device nodes allow write access.
	      Nautilus-cd-burner talks to CD/DVD burners through the
	      SCSI CAM subsystem.  Therefore, you must make sure
	      you have the following configured in your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
device          scbus
device          cd
device          pass
	    </pre>

	    <p>You must also make sure you have the following configured in
	      your kernel if you are using an ATAPI CD/DVD burner:</p>

	    <pre>
device		atapicam
	    </pre>

	    <p>To figure out which CD/DVD drive you will be using, run the
	      following command as root:</p>

	    <pre>
# camcontrol devlist
	    </pre>

	    <p>Your output will look similar to the following:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;QSI CDRW/DVD SBW-242 UD22&gt;		at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (cd0,pass0)
	    </pre>

	    <p>The devices in parentheses at the end are important.  You
	      must make sure the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for those devices
	      are writable by the users that will be using
	      nautilus-cd-burner.  In addition to those devices,
	      <tt>/dev/xpt*</tt> must also be writable to your
	      nautilus-cd-burner users.  The following
	      <tt>/etc/devfs.conf</tt> configuration will achieve the
	      desired results given the above devlist (<b>NB:</b>
	      <tt>devfs.conf</tt> is only supported on FreeBSD 5.x):</p>

	      <pre>
perm    cd0     0666
perm    xpt0    0666
perm    pass0   0666
	      </pre>

	      <p>On FreeBSD 4.x, you can simply set the device node
	        permissions, and they will be preserved across reboots.
		Note that you must use the 'c' device nodes on
		FreeBSD 4.x (e.g. <tt>cd0c</tt>).</p>

	    <p><b>How do I add new GDM sessions?</b></p>
<!-- A16 -->
	  <p>The process for adding new GDM sessions has changed substantially
	    between GNOME 2.2 and &gnomever;.  In order to add new sessions
	    now, you must create a <tt>.desktop</tt> file containing the session
	    configuration information.  Session files live in
	    <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>.  For example, to add
	    a KDE session, create a file in <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>
	    called <tt>kde.desktop</tt>.  That file should contain the
	    following:</p>

	    <pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=KDE
Comment=This session logs you into KDE
Exec=/usr/local/bin/startkde
TryExec=/usr/local/bin/startkde
Icon=
Type=Application
	    </pre>

	    <p>This file must have execute permissions.  For example:</p>

	    <pre>
# chmod 0555 kde.desktop
	    </pre>

	    <p>After creating this file, restart GDM, and there will be a
	      <b>KDE</b> link under the <em>Sessions</em> menu.</p>

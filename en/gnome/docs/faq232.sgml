      <p><b>How do I upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
      <p>The answer is relatively simple:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>To build GNOME &gnomever;, you need to obtain the latest
	    ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily accomplished with
	    <tt>portsnap(8)</tt> or <a
	    href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">CVSup</a>. 
	    Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are ready to go.</p>

	  <p>If you are a <tt>portupgrade(1)</tt> users, Then do the following:</p>

	  <pre>
# pkgdb -fF
# pkg_deinstall -f0 gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
# portupgrade -aOW
	  </pre>

	    <p><b>NOTE:</b> it is recommended to run <b>portupgrade
	    -a</b> to make sure you get all the necessary ports.  The
	    -W option simply makes things a bit faster by not doing a
	    <tt>make clean</tt> after each port build.</p>

	  <p>If you are a <tt>portmaster(8)</tt> user, make sure you have
	    least 3.1 version. Then do the following:</p>

	  <pre>
# pkg_delete -f gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
# portmaster -a
	  </pre>

	</ol>
	</li>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
      <p><b>The upgrade failed; what do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
      <p>Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.  There are many possible
        valid GNOME configurations, and even more invalid starting points.  If the script fails,
	follow the instructions in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
	failure.</p>

      <p>The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues.  One simple way to resolve
        the problem is to remove the offending port, re-run <tt>portupgrade</tt> or <tt>portmaster</tt>, and then
	reinstall the port when the upgrade process is complete.</p>
      </li>

<!-- Q4 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
      <p><b>List of GNOME &gnomever; problems and their solutions</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
      <p>Although GNOME &gnomever; is certainly the best release to date (of course), there are
	    a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the GNOME code and in its implementation
		within FreeBSD.  Some of the more visible issues are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Clutter based applications like mutter and a number of 
	  gnome-games, will crash when using Software Rasterizer rendering. 
	  You can check it with <tt>glxinfo | grep render</tt>. A solution is
	  being worked on.</li>
	<li>Brasero has a bug that it crashes when creating new burn projects. 
	  Premade iso burning works as expected.</li>
	<li>PackageKit where ported to FreeBSD. It does have some rough edges still.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
      <p><b>I have found a bug; whom should I alert?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
      <p>Please read the FreeBSD GNOME Project's
        <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/bugging.html">documentation on reporting bugs</a>.

      <p><b>I want the fame and glory of being part of the FreeBSD GNOME team!
	    What can I do to participate?</b></p>

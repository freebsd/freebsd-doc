		    <title>GNOME 2.3.1 desktop available for FreeBSD</title>

		    <p>It's a bit late, but here none the less.  For those
			willing to live on the edge, the next installment
			of the GNOME 2.3 development snapshot, code named
			"Daddy Walrus," has been ported.  This snapshot
			lacks three ports found in the official GNOME
			distribution.  They are gnopernicus, gnome-speech,
			and gnome-system-tools.  The latter is missing
			because it does not fully work with FreeBSD, while
			the two former components rely on festival, which
			is broken on -CURRENT.  To help out with the
			testing, checkout the ``ports'' module per the
			instructions at <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi">http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi</a>.
			Be sure to download the ``marcusmerge'' script as
			well to aid in upgrading existing ports.</p>

			development releases is now available.  Code named
			"Mighty Atom," this release includes quite a few

			September 8.  The full scoop can be found
			<a href="http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1045">

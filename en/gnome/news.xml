			lacks three ports found in the official GNOME
			distribution.  They are gnopernicus, gnome-speech,

			because it does not fully work with FreeBSD, while

          <title>Full port of GNOME2 beta 5 release is available</title>

          <p>The FreeBSD <a href="mailto:gnome@FreeBSD.org">GNOME Team</a>
            has finished porting of GNOME2 beta 5 release to FreeBSD.
            All existing ports were updated and many missed were added.
            The FreeBSD Ports Collection now contains all bits and
            pieces of the GNOME2 platform, both desktop and development
            ones.</p>

          <p>The team now works on improving quality of the port, by
            tracking down FreeBSD-specific problems and fixing them.
            Another goal is to provide set of pre-built GNOME2 binary
            packages on the official FreeBSD 4.6 release media along with
            GNOME 1.4 bits and pieces.</p>

          <p>We would encourage any help from our users in the form of
            problem reports, patches, suggestions etc.</p>

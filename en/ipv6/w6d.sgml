    <h2>About World IPv6 Day</h2>

    <p>While Internet Protocol version 6 is in fact more than 15 years old,
      World IPv6 Day, a 24 hour test flight day on <b>8 June 2011</b> has
      motivated a lot of different organizations to get ready for IPv6, or
      improve their already existent IPv6 support.  Major content providers
      will enable IPv6 for their websites that day, network operators and
      hosting companies have been working to provide IPv6 to their customers
      and operating system vendors like &os; have been improving IPv6 support.
      You can find more information about World IPv6 Day on The Internet
      Society's web page
      <a href="http://www.worldipv6day.org/">www.worldipv6day.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>You and &os; on World IPv6 Day</h2>

    <p>What is special about that day for &os; you might wonder?  Indeed,
    with the help of the community, &os; has been serving releases on IPv6
    since 2003.  We have our major infrastructure like
    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">www.freebsd.org</a> IPv6 enabled since
    <a href="&base;/news/2007/index.html#event200782:0">2007</a>.  &os; itself
    has been supporting IPv6 since the 4.0 Release for over a decade now,
    using the <a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME</a> based reference
    implementation.
    </p>
    <p>Nonetheless there are things we can do during that day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>help promoting IPv6.<br>
        During the day there might be a lot more IPv6 users suddenly, and
        some people are expecting significantly more traffic.  A lot of
        &os; servers are out there actively using IPv6, some people have put
        &os; into their networking products, but only few tell us.  We would
        love to hear about your &os; IPv6 experiences on World IPv6 Day.
      </li>
      <li>help you in case of problems.<br>
        Obviously if you will run into problems you might want help immediately
        for the one day test flight.  We will more closely monitor the
        <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-net">
        &os; networking mailing list</a>, as well as being around on IRC in
        #freebsd-w6d on EFNet to answer your questions.  In case you will file
        an IPv6 related <a href="&base;/support/bugreports.html">bug
        report</a>, you may want to tag it with <small><tt>[ip6]</tt></small>.
      </li>
      <li>working on improving your IPv6 experience.<br>
        As we get your questions and feedback we will take notes to further
        improve IPv6 support in &os;.  There might not be an immediate change
        but rest assured that your feedback will not be lost.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Join us for World IPv6 Day, spread the word, to help improving IPv6
      support in &os; even further!</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>What is this IPv6 thing?</h3>
    <p>Please see the
      <a href ="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/network-ipv6.html">
      chapter on IPv6</a> in the &os;
      <a href ="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>
      for an explanation.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you provide IPv6 connectivity?</h3>
    <p>&os; is an operating system, not an Internet Service Provider.
      There are multiple ways to connect to an IPv6 network with &os;
      however:
    </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>direct configuration on an (Ethernet) interface,</li>
      <li>ppp and IPV6CP by user space ppp or some ports, and</li>
      <li>various tunnel brokers we support out of base or ports</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>to just name a few.<br>
      Please see the
      <a href ="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/network-ipv6.html">
      chapter on IPv6</a> in the &os;
      <a href ="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>
      for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>I have problems getting IPv6 to work on FreeBSD. Can you help?</h3>
    <p>Most likely.  If our documentation did not help you, contact us.  See
      the previous section on how to best do that during World IPv6 Day.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is IPv6 not enabled by default?</h3>
    <p>IPv6 has a mandatory link-local address.
      In times where many people are are also using FreeBSD on their mobile
      computers and joining random networks the services they started would
      be accessible by other people on the same network.  This may also happen
      if they only started the services for IPv4 and are not aware of IPv6 at
      all, do not have tcp-wrappers or a firewall in place.  To not put people
      at risk, IPv6 is disabled by default on FreeBSD.<br>
      However we already provide support for you to configure it from our
      installer and it will automatically start to work as soon as you
      configure an interface for stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC)
      or with a static IPv6 address as it has been available in all default
      configurations we have been shipping since 4.0 Release.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you have a desktop version as well?</h3>
    <p>&os; comes with a huge collections of <a href="&base;/ports/">ports</a>
      that allow you to install a graphical user interface and window manager
      of choice.  &os; however does not ship with a graphical desktop
      preconfigured.  Other &os; derived projects like
      <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/">PC-BSD</a> however do an excellent
      job there.
    </p>

    <h3>I have reported a problem but it is not fixed yet.</h3>
    <p>We are sorry that this is the case.  If you have submitted a
      <a href="&base;/support/bugreports.html">bug report</a> it is not lost.
      &os; is developed and maintained by a
      <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html">
      large team of individuals</a> and there might have been other things we
      worked on to improve &os;.

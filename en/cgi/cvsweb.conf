# CVS roots
#
# CVSweb can handle several CVS repositories at once.  Enter short (internal)
# symbolic repository names, their names in the UI and the actual locations
# here.  The repositories will be listed in the order they're specified here.
#
# Obviously, CVSweb will need read access to these repository dirs.  If you
# receive an error that no valid CVS roots were found, double-check the file
# permissions and any other attributes your system may have for the repository
# directories, such as SELinux file contexts.
#
# CVSweb will also load per-cvsroot configuration files if they exist.
# The symbolic_name (see below) of the CVS root will be concatenated into the
# name of the main (this) configuration file along with a hyphen, and that
# file will be loaded for that particular CVS root.  For examples, see
# cvsweb.conf-* in the CVSweb distribution.
#
# Note that only local repositories are currently supported.  Things like
# :pserver:someone@xyz.com:/data/cvsroot won't work.

# so you'll want to use 2 * 0-based-index-number here; or set this directly
# to the default's symbolic name. Unless specified, the first valid one in
# @CVSrepositories is used as the default.

# For example:

<p>
This is a WWW interface for the !!CVSROOTdescr!! CVS repository.
You can browse the file hierarchy by following directory links (which
have slashes after them, e.g. <code>src/</code>).
If you follow a link to a file, you will see its revision history.
Following a link labeled with a revision number will display that
revision of the file.  In the revision history view, there is a link
near each revision to display diffs between that revision and the
previous one, and a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to
display diffs between arbitrary revisions.

Henrik Nordstr&ouml;m, and Ken Coar, then Akinori MUSHA brought it

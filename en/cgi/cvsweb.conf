<p>
This is a WWW interface to the !!CVSROOTdescr!! CVS tree.
You can browse the file hierarchy by picking directories
(which have slashes after them, <i>e.g.</i>, <b>src/</b>).
If you pick a file, you will see the revision history
for that file.
Selecting a revision number will download that revision of
the file.  There is a link at each revision to display
diffs between that revision and the previous one, and
a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to
display diffs between arbitrary revisions.

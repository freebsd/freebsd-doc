<p>
This is a WWW interface to the !!CVSROOTdescr!! CVS tree.
You can browse the file hierarchy by picking directories
(which have slashes after them, <i>e.g.</i>, <b>src/</b>).
If you pick a file, you will see the revision history
for that file.
Selecting a revision number will download that revision of
the file.  There is a link at each revision to display
diffs between that revision and the previous one, and
a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to
display diffs between arbitrary revisions.

This script has been written by Bill Fenner and improved by Henner Zeller,
Henrik Nordstr&ouml;m, and Ken Coar, then Akinori MUSHA brought it

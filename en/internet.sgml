    <h2>FreeBSD was designed for the Internet</h2>
    
      <p>FreeBSD includes what many consider the <i>reference</i>
	implementation for TCP/IP software, the 4.4 BSD TCP/IP protocol stack,
	thereby making it ideal for network applications and the Internet.</p>

    <h2>FreeBSD supports standard TCP/IP
	protocols.</h2>

      <p>Like most &unix; systems, the FreeBSD operating system enables you
	to</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Share filesystems with NFS</li>
	
	<li>Distribute network information with NIS</li>
	
	<li>Support remote logins</li>
	
	<li>Do remote SNMP configuration and management</li>
	
	<li>Serve files with FTP</li>
	
	<li>Resolve Internet hostnames with DNS/BIND</li>
	
	<li>Route packets between multiple interfaces, including PPP and SLIP
	  lines</li>
	
	<li>Use IP Multicast services (the MBONE)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>FreeBSD lets you to turn a PC&nbsp;into a World Wide Web server or
	Usenet news relay with included software.  Using the included SAMBA
	software you can even share filesystems or printers with your Microsoft&reg;
	Windows&reg; machines and, with the supplied PCNFS authentication daemon,
	you can support machines running PC/NFS.  FreeBSD also supports
	Appletalk and Novell client/server networking (using an <a
	  href="http://www.netcon.com/">optional commercial package</a>),
	making it a true "Intranet" networking solution.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD also handles TCP extensions like the <a
	  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt">RFC-1323</a>
	high performance extension, plus SLIP and dial-on-demand PPP.  It is
	an operating system suitable for a home-based net surfer as well as a
	corporate systems administrator.</p>

    <h2>FreeBSD's networking is stable and
	fast.</h2>

      <p>If you need an Internet server platform that is reliable and offers
	the best performance under heavy load, then consider FreeBSD.  Here
	are just a few of the companies that make use of FreeBSD every
	day:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walnut Creek CDROM ran one of the most popular FTP servers
	  on the Internet, ftp.cdrom.com, exclusively on FreeBSD for
	  many years.  It was a single FreeBSD machine supporting 6000
	  connections, and capable of transferring more than 30
	  terabytes (as of June, 1999; yes that is <i>terabytes</i>!)
	  worth of files every month to more than 10 million
	  people.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Inc.</a> runs the ultimate
	  index of the Internet, serving scads of daily net surfers with
	  information about the World Wide Web. Yahoo, as well the companies
	  that advertise on Yahoo, rely on FreeBSD to run reliable and
	  responsive web servers.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a> is the leading
	  researcher of web server software usage on the Internet. They use
	  FreeBSD and Apache to power their website, and FreeBSD/Perl for
	  all their Internet data collection.
	</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>FreeBSD makes an ideal platform for these and other Internet
	services:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Company-wide or world-wide WWW service</li>
	
	<li>Proxy WWW service</li>
	
	<li>Anonymous FTP&nbsp;service</li>
	
	<li>Enterprise file, print and mail services</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The FreeBSD <a href="&base;/ports/index.html">ports collection</a>
	contains ready-to-run software that makes it easy to set up your own
	Internet server.</p>
    
    <h2>High performance <em>and</em>
	security.</h2>
    
      <p>The FreeBSD developers are as concerned about security as they
	are about performance. FreeBSD includes kernel support for
	IP&nbsp;firewalling, as well other services, such as IP proxy
	gateways.  If you put your corporate servers on the Internet, any
	computer running FreeBSD can act as a network firewall to
	protect them from outside attack.</p>
      
      <p>Encryption software, secure shells, Kerberos, end-to-end encryption
	and secure RPC facilities are also available (subject to export
	restrictions).</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the FreeBSD team is proactive in detecting and
	disseminating security information and bug reports with a <a
	  href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">security officer</a> and
	ties to the Computer Emergency Response Team (<a
	  href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</a>).</p>

    <h2>What experts have to say...</h2>

      <p><i>``FreeBSD ... provides what is probably the most robust and capable
	  TCP/IP stack in existence ...''</i></p>

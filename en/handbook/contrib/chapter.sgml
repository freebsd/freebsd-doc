  <title>Contributing to FreeBSD</title>
  
  <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;.</emphasis></para>
  
  <para>So you want to contribute something to FreeBSD? That is great! We can
    always use the help, and FreeBSD is one of those systems that
    <emphasis>relies</emphasis> on the contributions of its user base in order
    to survive.  Your contributions are not only appreciated, they are vital
    to FreeBSD's continued growth!</para>
      
  <para>Contrary to what some people might also have you believe, you do not
    need to be a hot-shot programmer or a close personal friend of the FreeBSD
    core team in order to have your contributions accepted.  The FreeBSD
    Project's development is done by a large and growing number of
    international contributors whose ages and areas of technical expertise
    vary greatly, and there is always more work to be done than there are
    people available to do it.</para>
      
  <para>Since the FreeBSD project is responsible for an entire operating
    system environment (and its installation) rather than just a kernel or a
    few scattered utilities, our <filename>TODO</filename> list also spans a
    very wide range of tasks, from documentation, beta testing and
    presentation to highly specialized types of kernel development.  No matter
    what your skill level, there is almost certainly something you can do to
    help the project!</para>
      
  <para>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are also
    encouraged to contact us.  Need a special extension to make your product
    work? You will find us receptive to your requests, given that they are not
    too outlandish.  Working on a value-added product? Please let us know! We
    may be able to work cooperatively on some aspect of it.  The free software
    world is challenging a lot of existing assumptions about how software is
    developed, sold, and maintained throughout its life cycle, and we urge you
    to at least give it a second look.</para>
      
  <sect1>
    <title>What Is Needed</title>
    
    <para>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents something of
      an amalgam of the various core team <filename>TODO</filename> lists and
      user requests we have collected over the last couple of months.  Where
      possible, tasks have been ranked by degree of urgency.  If you are
      interested in working on one of the tasks you see here, send mail to the
      coordinator listed by clicking on their names.  If no coordinator has
      been appointed, maybe you would like to volunteer?</para>

      <para>The following tasks are purely cosmetic or represent such an

      <para>The first N items are from Terry Lambert

	  <para>A concerted effort at support for portable computers. This is
	    somewhat handled by changing PCMCIA bridging rules and power
	    management event handling.  But there are things like detecting
	    internal vs. external display and picking a different screen
	    resolution based on that fact, not spinning down the disk if the
	    machine is in dock, and allowing dock-based cards to disappear
	    without affecting the machines ability to boot (same issue for

      <title>Smaller tasks</title>
      
      <para>Most of the tasks listed in the previous sections require either a

	FreeBSD kernel (or both).  However, there are also many useful tasks
	which are suitable for &quot;weekend hackers&quot;, or people without
	programming skills.</para>
      
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If you run FreeBSD-current and have a good Internet

	  <para>Read the freebsd-bugs mailing list.  There might be a

	<listitem>
	  <para>Help translate FreeBSD documentation into your native language
	    (if not already available) &mdash; just send an email to &a.doc;
	    asking if anyone is working on it.  Note that you are not

	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>Read the freebsd-questions mailing list and &ng.misc
	    occasionally (or even regularly).  It can be very satisfying to
	    share your expertise and help people solve their problems;
	    sometimes you may even learn something new yourself! These forums
	    can also be a source of ideas for things to work on.</para>

      <title>Work through the PR database</title>

      <para>The <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi">FreeBSD PR
	  list</ulink> shows all the current active problem reports and
	requests for enhancement that have been submitted by FreeBSD users.
	Look through the open PRs, and see if anything there takes your
	interest.  Some of these might be very simple tasks, that just need an
	extra pair of eyes to look over them and confirm that the fix in the
	PR is a good one.  Others might be much more complex.</para>

      <para>Start with the PRs that have not been assigned to anyone else, but
	if one them is assigned to someone else, but it looks like something
	you can handle, e-mail the person it is assigned to and ask if you can
	work on it&mdash;they might already have a patch ready to be tested,
	or further ideas that you can discuss with them.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>How to Contribute</title>
    
    <para>Contributions to the system generally fall into one or more of the
      following 6 categories:</para>
	
    <sect2 id="contrib-general">
      <title>Bug reports and general commentary</title>
      
      <para>An idea or suggestion of <emphasis>general</emphasis> technical
	interest should be mailed to the &a.hackers;.  Likewise, people with
	an interest in such things (and a tolerance for a
	<emphasis>high</emphasis> volume of mail!) may subscribe to the
	hackers mailing list by sending mail to &a.majordomo;.  See <link
	  linkend="eresources-mail">mailing lists</link> for more information
	about this and other mailing lists.</para>
	  
      <para>If you find a bug or are submitting a specific change, please
	report it using the &man.send-pr.1; program or its <ulink
	  URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html">WEB-based
	  equivalent</ulink>.  Try to fill-in each field of the bug report.
	Unless they exceed 65KB, include any patches directly in the report.
	When including patches, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> use cut-and-paste
	because cut-and-paste turns tabs into spaces and makes them unusable.
	Consider compressing patches and using &man.uuencode.1; if they exceed
	20KB.  Upload very large submissions to <ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/incoming/">ftp.FreeBSD.org:/pub/FreeBSD/incoming/</ulink>.</para>
	  
      <para>After filing a report, you should receive confirmation along with
	a tracking number.  Keep this tracking number so that you can update
	us with details about the problem by sending mail to
	<email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.org</email>.  Use the number as the
	message subject, e.g.  <literal>"Re: kern/3377"</literal>.  Additional
	information for any bug report should be submitted this way.</para>
	  
      <para>If you do not receive confirmation in a timely fashion (3 days to
	a week, depending on your email connection) or are, for some reason,
	unable to use the &man.send-pr.1; command, then you may ask
	someone to file it for you by sending mail to the &a.bugs;.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Changes to the documentation</title>
      
      <para>Changes to the documentation are overseen by the &a.doc;.  Send
	submissions and changes (even small ones are welcome!) using
	<command>send-pr</command> as described in <link
	  linkend="contrib-general">Bug Reports and General
	  Commentary</link>.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Changes to existing source code</title>
      
      <para>An addition or change to the existing source code is a somewhat
	trickier affair and depends a lot on how far out of date you are with
	the current state of the core FreeBSD development. There is a special
	on-going release of FreeBSD known as &ldquo;FreeBSD-current&rdquo;
	which is made available in a variety of ways for the convenience of
	developers working actively on the system. See <link
	  linkend="current">Staying current with FreeBSD</link> for more
	information about getting and using FreeBSD-current.</para>
	  
      <para>Working from older sources unfortunately means that your changes
	may sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for easy re-integration
	into FreeBSD.  Chances of this can be minimized somewhat by
	subscribing to the &a.announce; and the &a.current; lists, where
	discussions on the current state of the system take place.</para>
	  
      <para>Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date sources
	to base your changes on, the next step is to produce a set of diffs to
	send to the FreeBSD maintainers.  This is done with the &man.diff.1;
	command, with the &ldquo;context diff&rdquo; form
	being preferred.  For example:</para>
      
      <para>
	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -c oldfile newfile</userinput></screen>

	or
	
	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -c -r olddir newdir</userinput></screen>
	    
	would generate such a set of context diffs for the given source file
	or directory hierarchy.  See the man page for &man.diff.1; for more
	details.</para>
	  
      <para>Once you have a set of diffs (which you may test with the
	  &man.patch.1; command), you should submit them for inclusion with
	FreeBSD.  Use the &man.send-pr.1; program as described in <link
	  linkend="contrib-general">Bug Reports and General Commentary</link>.
	<emphasis>Do not</emphasis> just send the diffs to the &a.hackers; or
	they will get lost! We greatly appreciate your submission (this is a
	volunteer project!); because we are busy, we may not be able to
	address it immediately, but it will remain in the pr database until we
	do.</para>

      <para>If you feel it appropriate (e.g. you have added, deleted, or
	renamed files), bundle your changes into a <command>tar</command> file
	and run the &man.uuencode.1; program on it.  Shar archives are also
	welcome.</para>

      <para>If your change is of a potentially sensitive nature, e.g. you are
	unsure of copyright issues governing its further distribution or you
	are simply not ready to release it without a tighter review first,
	then you should send it to &a.core; directly rather than submitting it
	with &man.send-pr.1;.  The core mailing list reaches a much smaller
	group of people who do much of the day-to-day work on FreeBSD.  Note
	that this group is also <emphasis>very busy</emphasis> and so you
	should only send mail to them where it is truly necessary.</para>
	  
      <para>Please refer to <command>man 9 intro</command> and <command>man 9
	  style</command> for some information on coding style. We would
	appreciate it if you were at least aware of this information before
	submitting code.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>New code or major value-added packages</title>
      
      <para>In the rare case of a significant contribution of a large body
	work, or the addition of an important new feature to FreeBSD, it
	becomes almost always necessary to either send changes as uuencode'd
	tar files or upload them to our ftp site <ulink
	  URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/incoming">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/incoming</ulink>.</para>
	  
      <para>When working with large amounts of code, the touchy subject of
	copyrights also invariably comes up.  Acceptable copyrights for code
	included in FreeBSD are:</para>
	  
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The BSD copyright.  This copyright is most preferred due to
	    its &ldquo;no strings attached&rdquo; nature and general
	    attractiveness to commercial enterprises.  Far from discouraging
	    such commercial use, the FreeBSD Project actively encourages such
	    participation by commercial interests who might eventually be
	    inclined to invest something of their own into FreeBSD.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>The GNU Public License, or &ldquo;GPL&rdquo;.  This license is
	    not quite as popular with us due to the amount of extra effort
	    demanded of anyone using the code for commercial purposes, but
	    given the sheer quantity of GPL'd code we currently require
	    (compiler, assembler, text formatter, etc) it would be silly to
	    refuse additional contributions under this license.  Code under
	    the GPL also goes into a different part of the tree, that being
	    <filename>/sys/gnu</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/src/gnu</filename>, and is therefore easily
	    identifiable to anyone for whom the GPL presents a problem.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      
      <para>Contributions coming under any other type of copyright must be
	carefully reviewed before their inclusion into FreeBSD will be
	considered.  Contributions for which particularly restrictive
	commercial copyrights apply are generally rejected, though the authors
	are always encouraged to make such changes available through their own
	channels.</para>
	  
      <para>To place a &ldquo;BSD-style&rdquo; copyright on your work, include

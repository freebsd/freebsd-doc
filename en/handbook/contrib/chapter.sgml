      <title>Contributing to FreeBSD</title>
      
      <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;.</emphasis></para>
      
      <para>So you want to contribute something to FreeBSD? That is great! We
	can always use the help, and FreeBSD is one of those systems that
	<emphasis>relies</emphasis> on the contributions of its user base in
	order to survive. Your contributions are not only appreciated, they
	are vital to FreeBSD's continued growth!</para>
      
      <para>Contrary to what some people might also have you believe, you do
	not need to be a hot-shot programmer or a close personal friend of the
	FreeBSD core team in order to have your contributions accepted. The
	FreeBSD Project's development is done by a large and growing number of
	international contributors whose ages and areas of technical expertise
	vary greatly, and there is always more work to be done than there are
	people available to do it.</para>
      
      <para>Since the FreeBSD project is responsible for an entire operating
	system environment (and its installation) rather than just a kernel or
	a few scattered utilities, our <filename>TODO</filename> list also spans a very wide
	range of tasks, from documentation, beta testing and presentation to
	highly specialized types of kernel development. No matter what your
	skill level, there is almost certainly something you can do to help
	the project!</para>
      
      <para>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are
	also encouraged to contact us. Need a special extension to make your
	product work? You will find us receptive to your requests, given that
	they are not too outlandish. Working on a value-added product?
	Please let us know! We may be able to work cooperatively on some
	aspect of it. The free software world is challenging a lot of
	existing assumptions about how software is developed, sold, and
	maintained throughout its life cycle, and we urge you to at least give
	it a second look.</para>

	<title>What Is Needed</title>
	
	<para>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents
	  something of an amalgam of the various core team <filename>TODO</filename> lists and user
	  requests we have collected over the last couple of months. Where
	  possible, tasks have been ranked by degree of urgency. If you are
	  interested in working on one of the tasks you see here, send mail to
	  the coordinator listed by clicking on their names. If no
	  coordinator has been appointed, maybe you would like to
	  volunteer?</para>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Drivers built into the kernel that use the BIOS call
		  mechanism to allow them to be independent of the actual
		  underlying hardware the same way that DOS is independent of
		  the underlying hardware. This includes NetWork and ASPI
		  drivers loaded in DOS prior to BSD being loaded by a
		  DOS-based loader program, which means potential polling,
		  which means DOS-not-busy interrupt generation for V86
		  machines by the protected mode kernel.</para>

	      <listitem>
		<para>An image format that allows tagging of such drivers data
		  and text areas in the default kernel executable so that that
		  portion of the kernel address space may be recovered at a
		  later time, after hardware specific protected mode drivers
		  have been loaded and activated. This includes separation of

	<title>How to Contribute</title>
	
	<para>Contributions to the system generally fall into one or more of
	  the following 6 categories:</para>
	
	
	<sect2 id="contrib-general">
	  <title>Bug reports and general commentary</title>
	  
	  <para>An idea or suggestion of <emphasis>general</emphasis>
	    technical interest should be mailed to the &a.hackers;. Likewise,
	    people with an interest in such things (and a tolerance for a
	    <emphasis>high</emphasis> volume of mail!) may subscribe to the
	    hackers mailing list by sending mail to &a.majordomo;. See
	    <link linkend="eresources-mail">mailing lists</link> for more
	    information about this and other mailing lists.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you find a bug or are submitting a specific change, please
	    report it using the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>send-pr</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>program or its
	    <ulink URL="http://www.freebsd.org/send-pr.html">WEB-based
	      equivalent</ulink>. Try to fill-in each field of the bug report.
	    Unless they exceed 65KB, include any patches directly in the
	    report. Consider compressing them and using
	    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>uuencode</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> if they exceed 20KB. Upload very large submissions to <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/incoming/">ftp.freebsd.org:/pub/FreeBSD/incoming/</ulink>.</para>
	  
	  <para>After filing a report, you should receive confirmation along
	    with a tracking number. Keep this tracking number so that you can
	    update us with details about the problem by sending mail to <email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.ORG</email>. Use the number as the message subject, e.g. <literal>"Re: kern/3377"</literal>. Additional information for any bug report should be submitted this way.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you do not receive confirmation in a timely fashion (3 days
	    to a week, depending on your email connection) or are, for some
	    reason, unable to use the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>send-pr</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> command,
	    then you may ask someone to file it for you by sending mail to the

	      Commentary</link>.</para>
	  
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
	  <title>Changes to existing source code</title>
	  
	  <para>An addition or change to the existing source code is a
	    somewhat trickier affair and depends a lot on how far out of date
	    you are with the current state of the core FreeBSD development.
	    There is a special on-going release of FreeBSD known as
	    &ldquo;FreeBSD-current&rdquo; which is made available in a variety of ways
	    for the convenience of developers working actively on the system.
	    See <link linkend="current">Staying current with FreeBSD</link>
	    for more information
	    about getting and using FreeBSD-current.</para>
	  
	  <para>Working from older sources unfortunately means that your
	    changes may sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for easy
	    re-integration into FreeBSD. Chances of this can be minimized
	    somewhat by subscribing to the &a.announce; and the &a.current;
	    lists, where discussions on the current state of the system take
	    place.</para>
	  
	  <para>Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date
	    sources to base your changes on, the next step is to produce a set
	    of diffs to send to the FreeBSD maintainers. This is done with
	    the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>diff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> command, with the &ldquo;context diff&rdquo;
	    form being preferred. For example:</para>
	  
	    <para><informalexample>
	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -c oldfile newfile</userinput></screen>
	    </informalexample>

	    or
	    
	    <informalexample>
	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -c -r olddir newdir</userinput></screen>
	    </informalexample>

	    would generate such a set of context diffs for
	    the given source file or directory hierarchy. See the man page
	    for <citerefentry><refentrytitle>diff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> for more details.</para>
	  
	  <para>Once you have a set of diffs (which you may test with the
	    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>patch</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> command), you should submit them for
	    inclusion with FreeBSD. Use the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>send-pr</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	    program as described in

	    submission (this is a volunteer project!); because we are busy, we
	    may not be able to address it immediately, but it will remain in
	    the pr database until we do.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you feel it appropriate (e.g. you have added, deleted, or
	    renamed files), bundle your changes into a <command>tar</command> file and run the
	    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>uuencode</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> program on it. Shar archives are
	    also welcome.</para>
	  
	  <para>If your change is of a potentially sensitive nature, e.g. you
	    are unsure of copyright issues governing its further distribution
	    or you are simply not ready to release it without a tighter review
	    first, then you should send it to &a.core; directly rather than
	    submitting it with <citerefentry><refentrytitle>send-pr</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>. The core
	    mailing list reaches a much smaller group of people who do much of
	    the day-to-day work on FreeBSD. Note that this group is also
	    <emphasis>very busy</emphasis> and so you should only send mail to
	    them where it is truly necessary.</para>
	  
	  <para>Please refer to <command>man 9 intro</command> and
	    <command>man 9 style</command> for some information on

	  <title>New code or major value-added packages</title>
	  
	  <para>In the rare case of a significant contribution of a large body
	    work, or the addition of an important new feature to FreeBSD, it
	    becomes almost always necessary to either send changes as
	    uuencode'd tar files or upload them to our ftp site <ulink

	  <para>When working with large amounts of code, the touchy subject of
	    copyrights also invariably comes up. Acceptable copyrights for
	    code included in FreeBSD are:</para>
	  
	  
	    <orderedlist>
	      
	      <listitem>
		<para>The BSD copyright. This copyright is most preferred due
		  to its &ldquo;no strings attached&rdquo; nature and general
		  attractiveness to commercial enterprises. Far from
		  discouraging such commercial use, the FreeBSD Project
		  actively encourages such participation by commercial
		  interests who might eventually be inclined to invest
		  something of their own into FreeBSD.</para>
	      </listitem>
	      
	      <listitem>
		<para>The GNU Public License, or &ldquo;GPL&rdquo;. This license is not
		  quite as popular with us due to the amount of extra effort
		  demanded of anyone using the code for commercial purposes,
		  but given the sheer quantity of GPL'd code we currently
		  require (compiler, assembler, text formatter, etc) it would
		  be silly to refuse additional contributions under this
		  license. Code under the GPL also goes into a different part
		  of the tree, that being <filename>/sys/gnu</filename> or
		  <filename>/usr/src/gnu</filename>, and is therefore easily
		  identifiable to anyone for whom the GPL presents a
		  problem.</para>
	      </listitem>
	      
	    </orderedlist>
	  
	  
	  <para>Contributions coming under any other type of copyright must be
	    carefully reviewed before their inclusion into FreeBSD will be
	    considered. Contributions for which particularly restrictive
	    commercial copyrights apply are generally rejected, though the
	    authors are always encouraged to make such changes available
	    through their own channels.</para>
	  
	  <para>To place a &ldquo;BSD-style&rdquo; copyright on your work, include the
	    following text at the very beginning of every source code file you
	    wish to protect, replacing the text between the

  <para>This large section of the handbook discusses the basics of building
    your own custom kernel for FreeBSD.  This section is appropriate for both
    novice system administrators and those with advanced Unix
    experience.</para>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>Why Build a Custom Kernel?</title>
    
    <para>Building a custom kernel is one of the most important rites of
      passage every Unix system administrator must endure.  This process,
      while time-consuming, will provide many benefits to your FreeBSD system.
      Unlike the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which must support every
      possible SCSI and network card, along with tons of other rarely used
      hardware support, a custom kernel only contains support for
      <emphasis>your</emphasis> PC's hardware.  This has a number of
      benefits:</para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>It will take less time to boot because it does not have to spend
	  time probing for hardware which you do not have.</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>A custom kernel often uses less memory, which is important
	  because the kernel is the one process which must always be present
	  in memory, and so all of that unused code ties up pages of RAM that
	  your programs would otherwise be able to use.  Therefore, on a
	  system with limited RAM, building a custom kernel is of critical
	  importance.</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>Finally, there are several kernel options which you can tune to
	  fit your needs, and device driver support for things like sound
	  cards which you can include in your kernel but are
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> present in the GENERIC kernel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="kernelconfig-building">
    <title>Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</title>
    
    <para>First, let us take a quick tour of the kernel build directory. All
      directories mentioned will be relative to the main
      <filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory, which is also accessible
      through <filename>/sys</filename>.  There are a number of subdirectories
      here representing different parts of the kernel, but the most important,
      for our purposes, are <filename>i386/conf</filename>, where you will
      edit your custom kernel configuration, and <filename>compile</filename>,
      which is the staging area where your kernel will be built.  Notice the
      logical organization of the directory tree, with each supported device,
      filesystem, and option in its own subdirectory.  Also, anything inside
      the <filename>i386</filename> directory deals with PC hardware only,
      while everything outside the <filename>i386</filename> directory is
      common to all platforms which FreeBSD could potentially be ported
      to.</para>
	
    <note>
      <para>If there is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
	<filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory on your system, then the
	kernel source has not been been installed.  The easiest way to do this
	is by running <command>/stand/sysinstall</command> as
	<username>root</username>, choosing <literal>Configure</literal>, then
	<literal>Distributions</literal>, then <literal>src</literal>, then
	<literal>sys</literal>.</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>Next, move to the <filename>i386/conf</filename> directory and copy
      the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file to the name you want
      to give your kernel.  For example:</para>
	  
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>
	  
    <para>Traditionally, this name is in all capital letters and, if you are
      maintaining multiple FreeBSD machines with different hardware, it is a
      good idea to name it after your machine's hostname.  We will call it
      <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> for the purpose of this example.</para>
	
    <note>
      <para>You must execute these and all of the following commands under the
	root account or you will get <errortype>permission denied</errortype>
	errors.</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>Now, edit <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> with your favorite text
      editor.  If you are just starting out, the only editor available will
      probably be <command>vi</command>, which is too complex to explain here,
      but is covered well in many books in the <link
	linkend="bibliography">bibliography</link>.  However, FreeBSD does
      offer an easier editor called &ldquo;ee&rdquo; which, if you are a
      beginner, should be your editor of choice.  Feel free to change the
      comment lines at the top to reflect your configuration or the changes
      you have made to differentiate it from
      <filename>GENERIC</filename>.</para>
	
    <para>If you have build a kernel under SunOS or some other BSD operating
      system, much of this file will be very familiar to you.  If you are
      coming from some other operating system such as DOS, on the other hand,
      the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file might seem
      overwhelming to you, so follow the descriptions in the <link
	linkend="kernelconfig-config">Configuration File</link> section slowly
      and carefully.</para>
    
    <note>
      <para>If you are trying to upgrade your kernel from an older version of
	FreeBSD, you will probably have to get a new version of
	    &man.config.8; from the same place you got the new kernel sources.
	It is located in <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin</filename>, so you will
	need to download those sources as well.  Re-build and install it
	before running the next commands.</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>When you are finished, type the following to compile and install
      your kernel:</para>
    
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/usr/sbin/config MYKERNEL</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd ../../compile/MYKERNEL</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make depend</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
    
    <para>The new kernel will be copied to the root directory as
      <filename>/kernel</filename> and the old kernel will be moved to
      <filename>/kernel.old</filename>.  Now, shutdown the system and reboot
      to use your kernel.  In case something goes wrong, there are some <link
	linkend="kernelconfig-trouble">troubleshooting</link> instructions at
      the end of this document. Be sure to read the section which explains how
      to recover in case your new kernel <link
	linkend="kernelconfig-noboot">does not boot</link>.</para>
    
    <note>
      <para>If you have added any new devices (such as sound cards) you may
	have to add some <link linkend="kernelconfig-nodes">device
	  nodes</link> to your <filename>/dev</filename> directory before you
	can use them.</para>
    </note>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="kernelconfig-config">
    <title>The Configuration File</title>
    
    <para>The general format of a configuration file is quite simple.  Each
      line contains a keyword and one or more arguments.  For simplicity, most
      lines only contain one argument.  Anything following a
      <literal>#</literal> is considered a comment and ignored. The following
      sections describe each keyword, generally in the order they are listed
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename>, although some related keywords have
      been grouped together in a single section (such as Networking) even
      though they are actually scattered throughout the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> file.
	  <anchor id="kernelconfig-options"> An exhaustive list of options and
      more detailed explanations of the device lines is present in the
      <filename>LINT</filename> configuration file, located in the same
      directory as <filename>GENERIC</filename>.  If you are in doubt as to
      the purpose or necessity of a line, check first in
      <filename>LINT</filename>.</para>
	
    <para>The kernel is currently being moved to a better organization of the
      option handling.  Traditionally, each option in the config file was
      simply converted into a <option>-D</option> switch for the
      <acronym>CFLAGS</acronym> line of the kernel Makefile.  Naturally, this
      caused a creeping optionism, with nobody really knowing which option has
      been referenced in what files.</para>
	
    <para>In the new scheme, every <literal>#ifdef</literal> that is intended
      to be dependent upon an option gets this option out of an
      <filename>opt_<replaceable>foo</replaceable>.h</filename> declaration
      file created in the compile directory by <command>config</command>.  The
      list of valid options for <command>config</command> lives in two files:
      options that do not depend on the architecture are listed in
      <filename>/sys/conf/options</filename>, architecture-dependent ones in
      <filename>/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/options.<replaceable>arch</replaceable></filename>,
      with <emphasis>arch</emphasis> being for example
      <filename>i386</filename>.</para>

    <important>
      <title>Quoting numbers</title>

      <para>In all versions of FreeBSD up to and including 3-stable,
	  &man.config.8; required that any strings in the configuration file
	that contained numbers used as text had to be enclosed in double
	quotes.</para>

      <para>Where numbers are used as numbers, as in <literal>maxusers
	  64</literal>, the quotation marks are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	required.</para>

      <para>This requirement was removed in FreeBSD-current (the 4.0 release
	candidate).</para>

      <para>The examples here include the quote marks (<literal>"</literal>).
	If you are building a kernel on a -current system you should omit
	them.</para>
    </important>

    <sect2>
      <title>Mandatory Keywords</title>
      
      <para>These keywords are required in every kernel you build.</para>
      
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>machine <replaceable>arch</replaceable></literal>
	  </term>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first keyword is <literal>machine</literal>, which,
	      since FreeBSD only runs on Intel 386 (and compatible) chips and
	      DEC Alpha processors, will be either 
	      <replaceable>i386</replaceable> or

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The next keyword is <literal>cpu</literal>, which includes
	      support for each CPU supported by FreeBSD. The possible values
	      of <replaceable>cpu_type</replaceable> for i386 systems
	      include:</para>

	      <listitem>
		<para>I686_CPU</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	    <para>The values available for <replaceable>cpu_type</replaceable> 
		for Alpha systems include:</para>

	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    
	    <para>Multiple instances of the <literal>cpu</literal> line may be
	      present with different values of
	      <replaceable>cpu_type</replaceable> as are present in the
	      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel. For a custom kernel, it is
	      best to specify only the cpu you have.  If, for example, you
	      have an Intel Pentium, use <literal>I586_CPU</literal> for
	      <replaceable>cpu_type</replaceable>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>ident
	      <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable></literal></term>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Next, we have <literal>ident</literal>, which is the
	      identification of the kernel.  You should change this from
	      <filename>GENERIC</filename> to whatever you named your kernel, in
	      this example, <filename>MYKERNEL</filename>.  The value you put in
	      <literal>ident</literal> will print when you boot up the kernel,
	      so it is useful to give a kernel a different name if you want to
	      keep it separate from your usual kernel (if you want to build an
	      experimental kernel, for example).  Note that, as with
	      <literal>machine</literal> and <literal>cpu</literal>, enclose
	      your kernel's name in quotation marks if it contains any
	      numbers.</para>
		  
	    <para>Since this name is passed to the C compiler as a
	      <option>-D</option> switch, do not use names like
	      <filename>DEBUG</filename>, or something that could be confused
	      with another machine or CPU name, like
	      <literal>vax</literal>.</para>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>maxusers
	      <replaceable>number</replaceable></literal></term>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>This file sets the size of a number of important system
	      tables.  This number is supposed to be roughly equal to the
	      number of simultaneous users you expect to have on your machine.
	      However, under normal circumstances, you will want to set
	      <literal>maxusers</literal> to at least <literal>4</literal>,
	      especially if you are using the X Window System or compiling
	      software.  The reason is that the most important table set by
	      <literal>maxusers</literal> is the maximum number of processes,
	      which is set to <literal>20 + 16 * maxusers</literal>, so if you
	      set <literal>maxusers</literal> to <literal>1</literal>, then
	      you can only have 36 simultaneous processes, including the 18 or
	      so that the system starts up at boot time, and the 15 or so you
	      will probably create when you start the X Window System.  Even a
	      simple task like reading a man page will start up nine processes
	      to filter, decompress, and view it.  Setting
	      <literal>maxusers</literal> to <literal>4</literal> will allow
	      you to have up to 84 simultaneous processes, which should be
	      enough for anyone.  If, however, you see the dreaded
	      <errorname>proc table full</errorname> error when trying to
	      start another program, or are running a server with a large
	      number of simultaneous users (like Walnut Creek CDROM's FTP
	      site), you can always increase this number and rebuild.</para>
		  
	    <note>
	      <para><literal>maxuser</literal> does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
		limit the number of users which can log into your machine.  It
		simply sets various table sizes to reasonable values
		considering the maximum number of users you will likely have
		on your system and how many processes each of them will be
		running.  One keyword which <emphasis>does</emphasis> limit
		the number of simultaneous <emphasis>remote logins</emphasis>
		is <link linkend="kernelconfig-ptys">pseudo-device pty

	      Traditionally the kernel is called <filename>vmunix</filename>

	      You should always use <literal>kernel</literal> for
	      <replaceable>kernel_name</replaceable> because changing it will
	      render numerous system utilities inoperative.  The second part
	      of the line specifies the disk and partition where the root
	      filesystem and kernel can be found.  Typically this will be
	      <literal>wd0</literal> for systems with non-SCSI drives, or

	workstation from Ethernet. You can include other commonly-used
	filesystems in the kernel, but feel free to comment out support for

    <para>Suppose you add the IDE CD-ROM support to the kernel.  The line to
      add is:</para>
    
    <programlisting>
controller wcd0</programlisting>

    <para>This means that you should look for some entries that start with
      <filename>wcd0</filename> in the <filename>/dev</filename> directory,
      possibly followed by a letter, such as <literal>c</literal>, or preceded
      by the letter <literal>r</literal>, which means a &ldquo;raw&rdquo;
      device.  It turns out that those files are not there, so I must change
      to the <filename>/dev</filename> directory and type:</para>
    
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV wcd0</userinput></screen>
	  
    <para>When this script finishes, you will find that there are now
      <filename>wcd0c</filename> and <filename>rwcd0c</filename> entries in
      <filename>/dev</filename> so you know that it executed correctly.</para>
	
    <para>For sound cards, the command:
      	  
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV snd0</userinput></screen>

      creates the appropriate entries.</para>

    <note>
      <para>When creating device nodes for devices such as sound cards, if
	other people have access to your machine, it may be desirable to
	protect the devices from outside access by adding them to the
	<filename>/etc/fbtab</filename> file.  See <command>man
	  fbtab</command> for more information.</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>Follow this simple procedure for any other
      non-<filename>GENERIC</filename>  devices which do not have
      entries.</para>
    
    <note>
      <para>All SCSI controllers use the same set of <filename>/dev</filename>
	entries, so you do not need to create these.  Also, network cards and
	SLIP/PPP pseudo-devices do not have entries in
	<filename>/dev</filename> at all, so you do not have to worry about
	these either.</para>

    <title>If Something Goes Wrong</title>
    
    <para>There are four categories of trouble that can occur when
      building a custom kernel.  They are:</para>
    
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Config command fails</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the <command>config</command> command fails when you give
	    it your kernel description, you have probably made a simple error
	    somewhere.  Fortunately, <command>config</command> will print the
	    line number that it had trouble with, so you can quickly skip to
	    it with <command>vi</command>.  For example, if you see:
		
	    <screen>config: line 17: syntax error</screen>

	    you can skip to the problem in <command>vi</command> by typing
	    <command>17G</command> in command mode. Make sure the keyword is
	    typed correctly, by comparing it to the GENERIC kernel or another
	    reference.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Make command fails</term>
	      
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the <command>make</command> command fails, it usually
	    signals an error in your kernel description, but not severe enough
	    for <command>config</command> to catch it.  Again, look over your
	    configuration, and if you still cannot resolve the problem, send
	    mail to the &a.questions; with your kernel configuration, and it
	    should be diagnosed very quickly.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Kernel will not boot<anchor id="kernelconfig-noboot"></term>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>If your new kernel does not boot, or fails to recognize your
	    devices, do not panic! Fortunately, BSD has an excellent mechanism
	    for recovering from incompatible kernels.  Simply type the name of
	    the kernel you want to boot from (i.e.
	    <filename>kernel.old</filename>) at the FreeBSD boot prompt
	    instead of pressing return.  When reconfiguring a kernel, it is
	    always a good idea to keep a kernel that is known to work on
	    hand.</para>
		
	  <para>After booting with a good kernel you can check over your
	    configuration file and try to build it again.  One helpful
	    resource is the <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> file
	    which records, among other things, all of the kernel
	    messages from every successful boot.  Also, the
	      &man.dmesg.8; command will print the kernel messages from the
	    current boot.</para>
	  
	  <note>
	    <para>If you are having trouble building a kernel, make sure to
	      keep a <filename>GENERIC</filename>, or some other kernel that
	      is known to work on hand as a different name that will not get
	      erased on the next build.  You cannot rely on
	      <filename>kernel.old</filename> because when installing a new
	      kernel, <filename>kernel.old</filename> is overwritten with the
	      last installed kernel which may be non-functional.  Also, as
	      soon as possible, move the working kernel to the proper
	      <filename>kernel</filename> location or commands such as
		&man.ps.1; will not work properly.  The
	      proper command to &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the kernel file that
	      <command>make</command> installs (in order to move another
	      kernel back permanently) is:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags noschg /kernel</userinput></screen>
		    
	    <para>And, if you want to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; your new kernel into
	      place, or any file for that matter, so that it cannot be moved
	      or tampered with:</para>
	    
	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags schg /kernel</userinput></screen>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Kernel works, but <command>ps</command> does not work any
	  more!</term>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>If you have installed a different version of the kernel from
	    the one that the system utilities have been built with, for
	    example, an experimental &ldquo;4.0&rdquo; kernel on a
	    3.1-RELEASE system, many system-status commands like &man.ps.1;
	    and &man.vmstat.8; will not work any more.  You must recompile the
	    <filename>libkvm</filename> library as well as these utilities.
	    This is one reason it is not normally a good idea to use a
	    different version of the kernel from the rest of the operating
	    system.</para>

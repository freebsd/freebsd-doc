    <p>As management understanding of the Year 2000 problem (aka, "The
      Millennium Bug") increases, more and more companies are demanding
      official statements from the vendors of their hardware and software
      as to how their product will handle the year 2000 date rollover.</p>

    <p>Organizations that use unix and unix like operating systems
      such as FreeBSD are already one step ahead of the problem. FreeBSD
      will properly maintain time long after year 2000 passes.</p>

<h2>Background information</h2>

    <p><i>(This section based on the text from the <a
	  href="http://www.linux.org.uk/mbug.html">Linux Y2K compliance
	  page</a>)</i></p>
    
    <p>As with all Unix and Unixlike operating systems, time and dates in
      FreeBSD are represented internally as the number of seconds since the
      1st of January 1970 (the Unix "epoch"). Currently, that figure is stored 
      as a 32 bit integer, and will run out part way through 2038. By then we
      should (hopefully) be using a counter of 64 bits (or greater) which
      should be good until the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>Note that the OS being Y2K compliant will not fix errant
      applications that are not Y2K compliant.</p>

    <p>Note also that the OS expects to read the current date and time from
      the CMOS clock of your computer. Not all of these devices correctly
      handle the year 2000. You are advised to test each platform individually 
      to ensure that your hardware clock behaves correctly when going from
      1999 to 2000, and that it correctly interprets the year 2000 as a leap
      year.</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

      <p>FreeBSD will continue to properly maintain time well into the
      next century. Third party applications, however, might not.
      Your best defense against year 2000 issues is a good
      offense. Listening to stories claiming the coming meltdown of
      the world as we know it are <strong>not</strong> the way to
      solve the millennium bug. Nor is waiting until the last
      minute. The FreeBSD Project recommends that your organization
      apply sound system administration principles as the millennium
      approaches.</p>

      <p>There are tests that you can perform to see how your system will
      respond. Set your clock to a few minutes before midnight on New
      Year's Eve and watch the system time. Your system should display
      the year as 2000 and not 1900. If the year is displayed
      incorrectly, then you will have plenty of time to update your
      hardware. Operating your organizations information systems under
      their normal daily load with the clock set forward can provide
      valuable insight into your vulnerablility to year 2000 issues.</p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>
     "After extensive analysis and testing, we believe that FreeBSD is 100% Y2K
      compliant. In the unlikely event that something has been overlooked, we
      will do our best to fix it as soon as possible."

    <h2>Fixed problems</h2>
    
    <p>The following Y2K problems have been identified and fixed in
      FreeBSD.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1380">misc/1380</a></dt>
      <dd>Several programs have a hardcoded 19%d in responses for the year.
	Affected programs include: yacc, ftpd, and make.
	[Fixed: yacc v1.2 1999/01/18; ftpd v1.7 1996/08/05;
        make v1.4 1996/10/06]

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1382">conf/1382</a></dt>
      <dd>The sed script in /etc/rc.local that builds the host/kernel ID line
	for the message of the day relies on the year not going past
	1999.[Fixed v1.21 1996/10/24]
      </dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=3465">misc/3465</a></dt>
      <dd>The etc/namedb/make-localhost command generates the DNS serial
	number as YYMMDD. In the year 2000, this will be generated as
	1YYMMDD.[Fixed v1.2 1997/08/11]

      <dd>groff tmac macros have hardcoded 19 for generating some dates.
      [Fixed: tmac.e v1.3 1998/12/06; doc-common v1.10 1999/01/19]
      </dd>


      <dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9323">bin/9323</a></dt>

      <dd>In its obsolescent form, touch doesn't treat the two digit year
        year specification correctly. Years in the range 00-68 are treated
        as 1900-1968 instead of 2000-2068.[Fixed v1.7 1999/01/05]
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/usr.sbin/xntpd/parse/util/dcfd.c">xntpd/parse/util/dcfd.c</A></dt>
      <dd>The leap year calculations for the number of days in a year, and
	the conversion of DCF77 time to seconds since the Epoch were wrong.
	These errors affected all years.[Fixed v1.6 1999/01/12]
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/gnu/usr.bin/tar/getdate.y.diff?r1=1.3&amp;r2=1.4">tar/getdate.y</a></dt>
      <dd>Function Convert() was hard-coded for two digit years in range 70-99.
	Now adjusted to allow two digit years for 1970-2069.  The function
	does not allow for century non-leap years - y2k1 alert!
      [Fixed v1.4 1999/01/12]
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/fetch/http.c.diff?r1=1.22&amp;r2=1.24">fetch/http.c</a></dt>
      <dd>The HTTP protocol includes an obsolete date format which uses a
        two-digit year.  Previous versions of fetch would interpret all such
	dates in the 1900s; subsequent to this revision, the pivot described
	in <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/internet/rfc/rfc2068.txt">RFC
	2068</a> is employed, which causes two-digit years to be interpreted
	as always belonging to the current century unless they would be
	50 or more years in the future.  Since the HTTP servers which
	use this obsolete format are no longer widespread, this is not expected
	to have a significant impact.[Fixed v1.24 1999/01/15]
      </dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9500">misc/9500</a></dt>
      <dd>The `edithook' script in the CVSROOT directory uses a raw tm_year and
      will therefore display 01/01/100 for 2000-JAN-01.
      [Fixed v1.2 1999/01/17]
      </dd>
	
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9501">bin/9501</a></dt>
      <dd>Several cvs contrib files are not Y2K compliant.
      The log.pl and sccs2rcs.csh scripts prepend `19' to the year
      resulting in a display of 19100 for 2000. The log_accum.pl
      script uses a two digit year in one place and in another
      place assumes that the tm_year is year within century rather
      than years since 1900.
      [Fixed: log.pl v1.2 1999/01/15; sccs2rcs.csh v1.3 1999/01/15]
      </dd>
	
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9502">bin/9502</a></dt>
      <dd>The groff number register `yr' is assigned from a (struct tm).tm_year
      and therefore represents the number of years since 1900, not the
      year within the century (see definition in troff/input.cc).
      [Fixed, now set mod 100, input.cc V1.2 1999/06/03]

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9503">bin/9503</a></dt>
      <dd>PicoBSD's simple_httpd uses a raw tm_year and will therefore
      display 01/01/100 for 2000-JAN-01.[Fixed v1.2 1999/01/16]

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9505">bin/9505</a></dt>
      <dd>Adduser uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display 100/01/01 for
      2000-JAN-01.[Fixed v1.42 1999/01/15]
      </dd>
	
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9506">bin/9506</a></dt>
      <dd>Cron uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display 100 for 2000.

	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9507">bin/9507</a></dt>
      <dd>tcpslice(8) uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display
      100y01m01d... for 2000-JAN-01.  For compatibility, use a two-digit
      year until 2000.[Fixed v1.8 1999/01/20]

        the generation of the NNTP NEWGROUPS command. The other occurs     
        because knews doesn't think that 2000 is a leap year.              
        Both are fixed in knews-1.0b.1.[Port updated 1999/01/07]

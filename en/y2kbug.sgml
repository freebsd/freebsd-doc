    &header;
    
    <p>As management understanding of the Year 2000 problem (aka, "The
      Millennium Bug") increases, more and more companies are demanding
      official statements from the vendors of their hardware and software as
      to how their product will handle the year 2000 date rollover.</p>

    <p>Organizations that use unix and unix like operating systems such as
      FreeBSD are already one step ahead of the problem.  FreeBSD will
      properly maintain time long after year 2000 passes.</p>

    <h2>Background information</h2>
    
    <p><i>(This section based on the text from the <a
	  href="http://www.linux.org.uk/mbug.html">Linux Y2K compliance
	  page</a>)</i></p>
    
    <p>As with all Unix and Unixlike operating systems, time and dates in
      FreeBSD are represented internally as the number of seconds since the
      1st of January 1970 (the Unix "epoch").  Currently, that figure is
      stored as a 32 bit integer, and will run out part way through 2038. By
      then we should (hopefully) be using a counter of 64 bits (or greater)
      which should be good until the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>Note that the OS being Y2K compliant will not fix errant applications
      that are not Y2K compliant.</p>

    <p>Note also that the OS expects to read the current date and time from
      the CMOS clock of your computer.  Not all of these devices correctly
      handle the year 2000.  You are advised to test each platform
      individually to ensure that your hardware clock behaves correctly when
      going from 1999 to 2000, and that it correctly interprets the year 2000
      as a leap year.</p>

    <h2>What you can do</h2>

    <p>FreeBSD will continue to properly maintain time well into the next
      century.  Third party applications, however, might not.  Your best
      defense against year 2000 issues is a good offense.  Listening to
      stories claiming the coming meltdown of the world as we know it are
      <strong>not</strong> the way to solve the millennium bug.  Nor is
      waiting until the last minute.  The FreeBSD Project recommends that your
      organization apply sound system administration principles as the
      millennium approaches.</p>

    <p>There are tests that you can perform to see how your system will
      respond. Set your clock to a few minutes before midnight on New Year's
      Eve and watch the system time.  Your system should display the year as
      2000 and not 1900.  If the year is displayed incorrectly, then you will
      have plenty of time to update your hardware.  Operating your
      organizations information systems under their normal daily load with the
      clock set forward can provide valuable insight into your vulnerability
      to year 2000 issues.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> do this on a live
      production system.  You may confuse any applications you have which rely 
      on dates (billing systems, backup regimes, and so on).  Always conduct
      tests like this on development systems which can not affect any live
      data you may have.

      <dd>Several programs have a hardcoded 19%d in responses for the year.
	Affected programs include: yacc, ftpd, and make.  [Fixed: yacc v1.2
	1999/01/18; ftpd v1.7 1996/08/05; make v1.4 1996/10/06; fixes in

	for the message of the day relies on the year not going past 1999.

	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=3465">misc/3465</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The etc/namedb/make-localhost command generates the DNS serial
	number as YYMMDD. In the year 2000, this will be generated as
	1YYMMDD.  [Fixed v1.2 1997/08/11; fixes in FreeBSD-2.2.5 and

      <dd>In its obsolescent form, touch doesn't treat the two digit year
        year specification correctly.  Years in the range 00-68 are treated
        as 1900-1968 instead of 2000-2068.  [Fixed v1.7 1999/01/05; fixes in
        FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>

      <dd>The leap year calculations for the number of days in a year, and the
	conversion of DCF77 time to seconds since the Epoch were wrong.  These
	errors affected all years.  [Fixed v1.6 1999/01/12; fixes in

	Now adjusted to allow two digit years for 1970-2069.  The function

      <dd>The HTTP protocol includes an obsolete date format which uses a
	two-digit year.  Previous versions of fetch would interpret all such
	dates in the 1900s; subsequent to this revision, the pivot described
	in <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/internet/rfc/rfc2068.txt">RFC
	  2068</a> is employed, which causes two-digit years to be interpreted
	as always belonging to the current century unless they would be 50 or
	more years in the future.  Since the HTTP servers which use this
	obsolete format are no longer widespread, this is not expected to have
	a significant impact.  [Fixed v1.24 1999/01/15; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1

      <dd>Several cvs contrib files are not Y2K compliant.  The log.pl and
	sccs2rcs.csh scripts prepend `19' to the year resulting in a display
	of 19100 for 2000.  The log_accum.pl script uses a two digit year in
	one place and in another place assumes that the tm_year is year within
	century rather than years since 1900.  [Fixed: log.pl v1.2 1999/01/15;
	sccs2rcs.csh v1.3 1999/01/15; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>

      <dd>The groff number register `yr' is assigned from a (struct
	tm).tm_year and therefore represents the number of years since 1900,
	not the year within the century (see definition in troff/input.cc).

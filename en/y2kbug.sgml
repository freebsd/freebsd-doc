    <p>As management understanding of the Year 2000 problem (aka, "The
      Millennium Bug") increases, more and more companies are demanding
      official statements from the vendors of their hardware and software as
      to how their product will handle the year 2000 date rollover.</p>

    <p>Organizations that use &unix; and Unix-like operating systems such as
      FreeBSD are already one step ahead of the problem.  FreeBSD will
      properly maintain time long after year 2000 passes.</p>

    <h2>Background information</h2>
    
    <p><i>(This section based on the text from the <a
	  href="http://www.linux.org.uk/mbug.html">Linux Y2K compliance
	  page</a>)</i></p>
    
    <p>As with all Unix and Unix-like operating systems, time and dates in
      FreeBSD are represented internally as the number of seconds since the
      1st of January 1970 (the Unix "epoch").  Currently, that figure is
      stored as a 32 bit integer, and will run out part way through 2038. By
      then we should (hopefully) be using a counter of 64 bits (or greater)
      which should be good until the end of the universe.</p>

    <p>Note that the OS being Y2K compliant will not fix errant applications
      that are not Y2K compliant.</p>

    <p>Note also that the OS expects to read the current date and time from
      the CMOS clock of your computer.  Not all of these devices correctly
      handle the year 2000.  You are advised to test each platform
      individually to ensure that your hardware clock behaves correctly when
      going from 1999 to 2000, and that it correctly interprets the year 2000
      as a leap year.</p>

    <h2>What you can do</h2>

    <p>FreeBSD will continue to properly maintain time well into the next
      century.  Third party applications, however, might not.  Your best
      defense against year 2000 issues is a good offense.  Listening to
      stories claiming the coming meltdown of the world as we know it are
      <strong>not</strong> the way to solve the millennium bug.  Nor is
      waiting until the last minute.  The FreeBSD Project recommends that your
      organization apply sound system administration principles as the
      millennium approaches.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"After extensive analysis and testing, we believe that FreeBSD is
	100% Y2K compliant.  In the unlikely event that something has been
	overlooked, we will do our best to fix it as soon as possible."</p>

    <h2>Fixed problems</h2>
    
    <p>The following Y2K problems have been identified and fixed in
      FreeBSD.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1380">misc/1380</a></dt>
      
      <dd>Several programs have a hardcoded 19%d in responses for the year.
	Affected programs include: yacc, ftpd, and make.  [Fixed: yacc v1.2
	1999/01/18; ftpd v1.7 1996/08/05; make v1.4 1996/10/06; fixes in
	FreeBSD-2.2 and above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=1382">conf/1382</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The sed script in /etc/rc.local that builds the host/kernel ID line
	for the message of the day relies on the year not going past 1999.
	[Fixed v1.21 1996/10/24; fixes in FreeBSD-2.2 and above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=3465">misc/3465</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The etc/namedb/make-localhost command generates the DNS serial
	number as YYMMDD. In the year 2000, this will be generated as
	1YYMMDD.  [Fixed v1.2 1997/08/11; fixes in FreeBSD-2.2.5 and
	above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=4930">gnu/4930</a> and
	  <a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=8321">gnu/8321</a></dt>
      
      <dd>groff tmac macros have hardcoded 19 for generating some dates.
	[Fixed: tmac.e v1.3 1998/12/06; doc-common v1.10 1999/01/19; fixes in
	FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>


      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9323">bin/9323</a></dt>
      
      <dd>In its obsolescent form, touch doesn't treat the two digit year
        specification correctly.  Years in the range 00-68 are treated
        as 1900-1968 instead of 2000-2068.  [Fixed v1.7 1999/01/05; fixes in
        FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/usr.sbin/xntpd/parse/util/dcfd.c">xntpd/parse/util/dcfd.c</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The leap year calculations for the number of days in a year, and the
	conversion of DCF77 time to seconds since the Epoch were wrong.  These
	errors affected all years.  [Fixed v1.6 1999/01/12; fixes in
	FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/gnu/usr.bin/tar/getdate.y">tar/getdate.y</a></dt>
      
      <dd>Function Convert() was hard-coded for two digit years in range 70-99.
	Now adjusted to allow two digit years for 1970-2069.  The function
	does not allow for century non-leap years - y2k1 alert!  [Fixed v1.4
	1999/01/12; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1 and above]
      </dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/usr.bin/fetch/http.c">fetch/http.c</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The HTTP protocol includes an obsolete date format which uses a
	two-digit year.  Previous versions of fetch would interpret all such
	dates in the 1900s; subsequent to this revision, the pivot described
	in <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/internet/rfc/rfc2068.txt">RFC
	  2068</a> is employed, which causes two-digit years to be interpreted
	as always belonging to the current century unless they would be 50 or
	more years in the future.  Since the HTTP servers which use this
	obsolete format are no longer widespread, this is not expected to have
	a significant impact.  [Fixed v1.24 1999/01/15; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1
	and above]</dd>

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9500">misc/9500</a></dt>
      
      <dd>The `edithook' script in the CVSROOT directory uses a raw tm_year
	and will therefore display 01/01/100 for 2000-JAN-01.  [Fixed v1.2
	1999/01/17; not relevant to FreeBSD releases]</dd>
	
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9501">bin/9501</a></dt>
      
      <dd>Several cvs contrib files are not Y2K compliant.  The log.pl and
	sccs2rcs.csh scripts prepend `19' to the year resulting in a display
	of 19100 for 2000.  The log_accum.pl script uses a two digit year in
	one place and in another place assumes that the tm_year is year within
	century rather than years since 1900.  [Fixed: log.pl v1.2 1999/01/15;
	sccs2rcs.csh v1.3 1999/01/15; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1 and above]</dd>
	
      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9502">bin/9502</a></dt>
      <dd>The groff number register `yr' is assigned from a (struct
	tm).tm_year and therefore represents the number of years since 1900,
	not the year within the century (see definition in troff/input.cc).
	[Fixed, now set mod 100, troff/input.cc V1.2 1999/06/03; fixed
	in FreeBSD-3.3]</dd>

      <dd>PicoBSD's simple_httpd uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display
	01/01/100 for 2000-JAN-01.  [Fixed v1.2 1999/01/16; fixes in

      <dd>Adduser uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display 100/01/01 for
	2000-JAN-01.  [Fixed v1.42 1999/01/15; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1 and
	above]</dd>

	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9506">bin/9506</a></dt>
      
      <dd>Cron uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display 100 for 2000.

      <dt><a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=9507">bin/9507</a></dt>
      
      <dd>tcpslice(8) uses a raw tm_year and will therefore display
	100y01m01d... for 2000-JAN-01.  For compatibility, use a two-digit
	year until 2000.[Fixed v1.8 1999/01/20; fixes in FreeBSD-3.1 and
	above]</dd>

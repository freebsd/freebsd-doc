    <h2>If you got lots of irrelevant results...</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>If you search for several words such as "<tt>quantum
	  hard drives</tt>", an OR is implied meaning that to be
	  counted as relevant, only one of the word has to appear
	  in a message.  To find only messages with all three
	  words, change the search to "<tt>quantum and hard and
	  drives</tt>"<p></p></li>

      <li>If you still get lots of irrelevant messages, see if
	they have something in common. If so, you can exclude
	them with the <tt>not</tt> operator.  For example
	"<tt>quantum and hard and drives not ide</tt>" will
	exclude any messages about ide quantum hard drives.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>If you do not think you received everything you should have...</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>If one of your keywords has variant forms, be sure to
	enter all relevant forms.  If you are searching for
	"<tt>buslogic</tt>", you might change it to "<tt>buslogic
	  or bustek</tt>".<p></p></li>

      <li>Words with varying suffixes can be wildcarded.
	Searching for "<tt>drive*</tt>" will pick up words such
	as <tt>drive</tt>, <tt>drives</tt>, <tt>driver</tt>,
	<tt>drivers</tt> and so on.<p></p></li>

      <li>Try discarding words that could be implied by the
	context of the message.  For example "<tt>quantum and
	hard and drive</tt>" might miss some relevant messages
	that "<tt>quantum and drive</tt>" would get.</li>
    </ol>

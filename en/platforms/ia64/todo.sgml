  <h2>What needs to be done.</h2>

  <p>This page tries to be the starting point for people trying to find
    anything that can be done. The order of the items on this page are
    not strictly an indication of priority, but it is a good indication.
    There are in all likelyhood tasks that are not mentioned here, but
    that should be done nonetheless. A typical example is the maintenance
    of the ia64 web pages... unfortunately.</p>

  <h3>Becoming a tier 1 platform.</h3>

  <p>With two releases as a tier 2 platform, it is time to work towards
    becoming a tier 1 platform. This involves tasks as varied as:
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the installation process to take into account that
        there is already a GPT with an EFI partition, including other
        operating systems. The ability to add a FreeBSD entry to the
        EFI boot menu is also a nice thing.</li>
      <li>Port the GNU debugger. It is sorely missed on a development
        machine and required on tier 1 platforms.</li>
      <li>Port the X server (ports/x11/XFree86-4-Server). Not really
        required for tier 1 status, but one cannot truely do without
        if one wants to use ia64 as a desktop machine.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Ports and packages,</h3>

  <p>A very important task for the success of FreeBSD on ia64 is making
    sure that users have something to run besides ls(1). Our huge ports
    collection has been targeting ia32 for the most part, so it is not
    surprising that there are a lot of ports that do not build or do not
    work on ia64. Look
    <a href="http://bento.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/ia64-5-latest/">here</a>
    for the most up-to-date list of ports that fail to build for some
    reason or another. Note that if there are ports depending on one or
    more ports that fail, those are not built and are not counted. A good
    way to help out here is to work on those ports that have a lot of
    ports depending on it (see the "Aff." column in the table).</p>

  <h3>Sharpening the saw.</h3>

  <p>There are plenty functions (especially assembly routines) that
    have been written to provide the missing functionality without any
    consideration for speed and/or robustness. Reviewing those functions
    and replacing them if necessary is a good task that can be done
    concurrently and independently from other activity and does not
    necessarily require huge amounts of knowledge and/or experience.</p>

  <h3>Core development.</h3>

  <p>On top of the high-level things that do not work or do not exist,
    there is also some rather involved rewriting to be done at the
    foundation and can potentionally affect all other platforms as well.
    This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Improve UP and SMP stability by revamping the PMAP module.
        The low-level handling of VM translations needs to be improved.
        This involves both correctness as well as performance.</li>
      <li>Basic device drivers such as sio(4) and syscons(4) do not
        work on ia64 machines that do not have support for legacy
        devices. This is a rather big issue, because it affects all
        platforms and may involve rewriting (big) parts of certain
        subsystems. Clearly a task that needs wholesale support and
        coordination.</li>
      <li>Better handling of sparse (physical) memory configurations
        by not creating VM tables that span the whole address space,
        but rather cover the memory "chunks" that are present. We are
        currently forced to ignore memory because of this.</li>
    </ul>

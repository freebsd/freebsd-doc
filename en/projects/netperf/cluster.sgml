    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The netperf cluster provides a multi-node, SMP-capable, network
      functionality and performance test capability for the <a
      href="../../">FreeBSD Project</a>, supporting a variety of on-going
      sub-projects including the <a href="./index.html">netperf project</a>,
      <a href="../dingo/index.html">Dingo project</a>, and on-going work on
      high performance threading.  The cluster is available on a check out
      basis for developers, who must request accounts be created by
      contacting one of the <a href="#admins">netperf cluster admins</a>.</p>

    <a name="donors"></a>
    <h2>Donors</h2>

    <p>The netperf cluster was made possible through the generous donation
      of a number of organizations, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="http://www.sentex.ca/">Sentex Data Communications</a>,
	who not only host the complete cluster, provide front-end build
	system, and the management infrastructure (remote power, serial
	console, network switch, etc), but also appear to be endlessly
	willing to help configure, reconfigure, and troubleshoot at almost
	any time of day or night.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="http://www.freebsdsystems.com/">FreeBSD Systems</a>,
	who through a generous matching grant with the FreeBSD Foundation,
	provide the majority of testing hardware used in the cluster,
	including three dual-Xeon test systems.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <a href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/">FreeBSD
	Foundation</a>, who provided a matching grant for the purposes of
	purchasing testing hardware, as well as taking ownership of hardware,
	offering tax receipts to donors in its role as a non-profit, and
	participating in cluster planning.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="http://www.ironport.com">IronPort Systems</a>, who have
	generously donated additional test hardware for use in the netperf
	cluster.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Donations to support the netperf cluster have an immediate and
      substantial impact on the success of a number of on-going performance
      projects, providing access to high-end hardware to a large number of
      developers.  If you or your company are interested in helping to
      support continued development of the netperf cluster as a resource for
      FreeBSD development, please contact the <a href="#admins">netperf
      cluster admins</a>.</p>

    <a name="admins"></a>
    <h2>Netperf Cluster Admins</h2>

    <p>The FreeBSD netperf cluster is managed by a small team of
      developer/administrators to support SMP development and performance
      testing on high-end hardware.  If you have any questions, including
      questions about access to the cluster as a developer, or about possible
      future donations of testing hardware, please feel free to contact the
      following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>&a.rwatson;</p></li>
      <li><p>&a.bmilekic;</p></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="resources"></a>
    <h2>Netperf Cluster Resources</h2>

    <p>The Netperf cluster consists of several systems interconnected using a
      management network, as well as individual back-to-back gigabit ethernet
      links for a test network.  The following systems are available as
      testing resources on a check-out basis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>zoo.FreeBSD.org</b> is the front-end build and management
	system.  All netperf cluster users are provided with accounts on this
	box, typically using the same account name and SSH keys as used to
	access the FreeBSD.org central cluster.  Connected to zoo's second
	network interface is a gigabit link to the internal management
	network.  Zoo provides DHCP, tftp, and NFS services to boxes in the
	cluster, as well as having serial access to the remote power system
	and serial console access to the test boxes.  Test kernels and
	software will typically be built and configured on zoo, then exported
	to the cluster via NFS.  Zoo exports its /zoo file system to the
	cluster, and cluster users will have a directory, /zoo/username, in
	which they can place any files to export.  Each machine has a
	/zoo/hostname directory, which consists of the root of an NFS root
	file system, as well as the tree from which tftp exports pxeboot
	loaders.  By substituting kernels and configuration files in these
	trees, most aspects of the test systems may be directly managed.
	This system was donated by Sentex Communications.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>elephant</b> is a dual-PIII 800MHz system with ATA disk
	subsystem.  Currently, the ATA disk holds two partitions, one with
	FreeBSD 4.x, and one with FreeBSD 5.x user space configuration
	on.  This system was donated by Robert Watson.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>orangutan</b> is a dual-Xeon 2GHz system equipped with an
	Adaptec SCSI RAID array.  Currently, the RAID array is configured to
	expose a single volume holding FreeBSD 6.x.  This system was donated
	by IronPort Systems.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>tiger-1</b>, <b>tiger-2</b>, and <b>tiger-3</b> are a set of
	interconnected, matching dual-Xeon 3GHz systems with ATA disk
	subsystems.  Each has four if_em network interfaces, and these are
	interconnected so that various topologies can be created.  Two ATA
	disks are connected, one with a FreeBSD 4.x and one with a FreeBSD
	5.x user space configuration on.  These systems were donated by
        FreeBSD Systems and the FreeBSD Foundation.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>cheetah</b> is a dual core Opteron 270 system with two
      2GHz CPUs each with two cores using a Tyan K8S Pro (S2882)
      motherboard.  The machine identifies as a quad processor machine
      in dmesg.  The system has SATA disk, 2GB of RAM, 1GB for each
      processor, and 5 ethernet ports.  fxp0 is the management port
      and em0, em1, bge0 and bge1 are gigE interfaces which will
      eventually connect cheetah to elephant and orangutan.  This system
      was donated by George Neville-Neil.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>hippo</b> is a quad-processor Pentium III 500MHz system
	with 50GB RAID array, donated by Sentex Communications.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>pjd</b> is a dual-processor Pentium D 3.0Ghz SMP system
	with four SATA disks and two hardware crypto devices, donated by
	Sentex Communications.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>apc2</b>, <b>apc3</b>, and <b>apc4</b> are the remote power
	consoles for the test network.  These systems were donated by
	Sentex Communications.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The current serial port and network configuration of test systems, as
      well as password information, can be found in /etc/motd on zoo.  We
      are currently interested in adding amd64 and em64t hardware to the
      cluster.</p>

    <a name="procedures"></a>
    <h2>Netperf Cluster Procedures</h2>

    <p>As the netperf cluster is a centrally managed and shared resource,
      understanding and consistent following of its procedures is important.
      In particular, following of the procedures makes it easier for
      developers to have reasonable expectations about the configuration of
      systems in the cluster, as well as to avoid treading on each others
      toes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Reserving a system</b> is currently done on an ad hoc basis.
	A wiki used to system reservation will shortly be introduced.  In
	general, it is recommended that reservations of systems occur for
	periods of 8 hours or shorter, in order to facilitate shared use,
	although longer tests or experiments are certainly possible.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Power cycling a system</b> is currently performed by
	connecting to apc2, the remote power system, using a serial port on
	zoo.  Because there is a single serial connection to the power
	system, it is requested that developers minimize the amount of time
	spent connected to it, so that parallel use of the system can occur
	more readily.  In particular, please do not leave a cu/tip session
	to the power system open for extended periods of time.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Booting a specific configuration</b> is currently performed
	by interrupting the boot of a system using the serial console, or
	modifying the /zoo/hostname/boot/loader.conf file to point at a new
	kernel.  Please do not replace the kernel in the NFS boot tree for a
	host; instead, install kernels in your /zoo/username tree, and
	explicitly configure hosts to use that kernel.  Please restore the
	defaults for a system, including removing any non-standard entries
	from loader.conf, when you are done with a test or
	experiment.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Reconfiguring on-disk installs</b> should be done only in
	coordination with the cluster admins.  If you change configuration
	settings for hosts during an experiment, please restore them.  If
	you install packages on the file systems of tests, please remove
	them when done.  A useful technique is to store required packages for
	experiments in NFS, and to add the packages for the duration of a
	development session.  While data can be left on systems between test
	runs, developers who are using data sets for common applications,
	such as MySQL, may wish to store that data in a personal directory
	as other testing on the host could interfere with it.  Developers
	are advised to check the configuration of systems before using them
	to make sure all is as expected.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Reconfiguring system BIOSes</b> should be avoided if at all
	possible.  Please restore any settings as soon as a test or
	experiment is complete.  <b>Please do not turn off BIOS serial console
	redirection, or modify any settings associated with console
	redirection!</b></p></li>

      <li><p><b>Check software configurations before testing</b> --
	specifically, use uname to confirm that the right kernel is running,
	that it's not configured for WITNESS or INVARIANTS if that's not
	needed, and that /etc/malloc.conf is set to "aj" if no debugging is
	desired.  Use 'ps' and 'pkg_info' to make sure only the software you
	expect is running, and that the version of the software you expect is
	installed.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="notes"></a>
    <h2>Current Configuration Notes and News</h2>

    <p>A few hopefully up-to-date configuration notes that may be relevant
      to users of the netperf cluster:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>20050624</b> - <b>cheetah</b> is now online!</p></li>

      <li><p><b>20050204</b> - <b>orangutan</b> is now configured to use
	PXEboot, thanks to help from Sentex.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>20050203</b> - system upgrades to <b>tiger-1</b>,
	<b>tiger-2</b>, and <b>tiger-3</b> have been completed -- the latest
	versions of 4.x (ar0s1) and 6.x (ar0s2) are now installed.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>20050203</b> - <b>zoo.FreeBSD.org</b> has been updated to
	the most recent version of 5-STABLE.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="reservations"></a>

    <h2>Project Goal</h2>

    <p>The netperf project is working to enhance the performance of the
      FreeBSD network stack.  This work grew out of the
      <a href="../../smp">SMPng Project</a>, which moved the FreeBSD kernel from
      a "Giant Lock" to more fine-grained locking and multi-threading.  SMPng
      offered both performance improvement and degradation for the network
      stack, improving parallelism and preemption, but substantially
      increasing per-packet processing costs.  The netperf project is
      primarily focussed on further improving parallelism in network
      processing while reducing the SMP synchronization overhead.  This in
      turn will lead to higher processing throughput and lower processing
      latency.</p>

    <h2>Project Strategies</h2>
    <p>Robert Watson</p>

    <p>The two primary focuses of this work are to increase parallelism
      while decreasing overhead.  Several activities are being performed that
      will work toward these goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Complete locking work to make sure all components of the stack
	are able to run without the Giant lock.  While most of the network
	stack, especially mainstream protocols, runs without Giant, some
	components require Giant to be placed back over the stack if compiled
	into the kernel, reducing parallelism.</p></li>

      <li><p>Optimize locking strategies to find better balances between
	locking granularity and locking overhead.  In the first cut at locking
	for the kernel, the goal was to adopt a medium-grained locking
	approach based on data locking.  This approach identifies critical
	data structures, and inserts new locks and locking operations to
	protect those data structures.  Depending on the data model of the
	code being protected, this may lead to the introduction of a
	substantial number of locks offering unnecessary granularity, where
	the overhead of locking overwhelms the benefits of available
	parallelism and preemption.  By selectively reducing granularity, it
	is possible to improve performance by decreasing locking overhead.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Amortize the cost of locking by processing queues of packets or
	events.  While the cost of individual synchronization operations may
	be high, it is possible to amortize the cost of synchronization
	operations by grouping processing of similar data (packets, events)
	under the same protection.  This approach focuses on identifying
	places where similar locking occurs frequently in succession, and
	introducing queueing or coalescing of lock operations across the
	body of the work.  For example, when a series of packets is inserted
	into an outgoing interface queue, a basic locking approach would
	lock the queue for each insert operation, unlock it, and hand off to
	the interface driver to begin the send, repeating this sequence as
	required.  With a coalesced approach, the caller would pass off a
	queue of packets in order to reduce the locking overhead, as well as
	eliminate unnecessary synchronization due to the queue being
	thread-local.  This approach can be applied at several levels in the
	stack, and is particularly applicable at lower levels of the stack
	where streams of packets require almost identical processing.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Introduce new synchronization strategies with reduced overhead
	relative to traditional strategies.  Most traditional strategies
	employ a combination of interrupt disabling and atomic operations to
	achieve mutual exclusion and non-preemption guarantees.  However,
	these operations are expensive on modern CPUs, leading to the desire
	for cheaper primitives with weaker semantics.  For example, the
	application of uni-processor primitives where synchronization is
	required only on a single processor, and optimizations to critical
	section primitives to avoid the need for interrupt disabling.
	</p></li>

      <li><p>Modify synchronization strategies to take advantage of
	additional, non-locking, synchronization primitives.  This approach
	might take the form of making increased use of per-CPU or per-thread
	data structures, which require little or no synchronization.  For
	example, through the use of critical sections, it is possible to
	synchronize access to per-CPU caches and queues.  Through the use of
	per-thread queues, data can be handed off between stack layers
	without the use of synchronization.</p></li>

      <li><p>Increase the opportunities for parallelism through increased
	threading in the network stack.  The current network stack model
	offers the opportunity for substantial parallelism, with outbound
	processing typically taking place in the context of the sending
	thread in kernel, crypto occurring in crypto worker threads, and
	receive processing taking place in a combination of the receiving
	ithread and dispatched netisr thread.  While handoffs between
	threads introduces overhead (synchronization, context switching),
	there is the opportunity to increase parallelism in some workloads
	through introducing additional worker threads.  Identifying work
	that may be relocated to new threads must be done carefully to
	balance overhead, and latency concerns, but can pay off by
	increasing effective CPU utilization and hence throughput.  For
	example, introducing additional netisr threads capable of running on
	more than one CPU at a time can increase input parallelism, subject
	to maintaining desirable packet ordering.</p></li>
    </ul>

	<td> Sockets and file descriptors both have reference counts in order
	  to prevent these objects from being free'd while in use.  However,
	  if a file descriptor is used to reach the socket, the reference
	  counts are somewhat interchangeable, as either will prevent
	  undesired garbage collection.  For socket system calls, overhead
	  can be reduced by relying on the file descriptor reference count,
	  thus avoiding the synchronized operations necessary to modify the
	  socket reference count, an approach also taken in the VFS code.
	  This change has been made for most socket system calls, and has
	  been committed to HEAD (6.x).  It has also been merged to RELENG_5

	  whether it offers the desired semantics and benefits.  The
	  implementation can be found in the rwatson_dispatch Perforce

	  required.  This has not yet been benchmarked.  A subset change to

	<td> The mutexes protecting per-CPU caches require atomic operations
	  on SMP systems; as they are per-CPU objects, the cost of
	  synchronizing access to the caches can be reduced by combining
	  CPU pinning and/or critical sections instead.  This change has now
	  been committed and will appear in 6.0-RELEASE; it results in a
	  several percentage performance in UDP send from user space, and
	  there have been reports of 20%+ improvements in allocation
	  intensive code within the kernel.  In micro-benchmarks, the cost
	  of allocation on SMP is dramatically reduced. </td>

      <tr>

	<td> &a.rwatson; </td>
	<td> 20050529 </td>
	<td> &status.done; </td>
	<td> Previously, malloc(9) used a single statistics structure
	  protected by a mutex to hold global malloc statistics for each
	  malloc type.  This change moves to per-CPU statistics structures,
	  which are coalesced when reporting memory allocation statistics to
	  the user, and protects them using critical sections.  This reduces
	  cache line contention for common allocation types by avoiding
	  shared lines, and also reduces synchronization costs by using
	  critical sections to synchronize access instead of a mutex.  While
	  malloc(9) is less frequently used in the network stack than uma(9),
	  it is used for socket address data, so is on performance critical
	  paths for datagram operations.  This has been committed and will
	  appear in 6.0-RELEASE. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td> Optimize critical section performance </td>
	<td> &a.jhb; </td>
	<td> 20050404 </td>
	<td> &status.done; </td>
	<td> Critical sections prevent preemption of a thread on a CPU, as
	  well as preventing migration of that thread to another CPU, and
	  maybe used for synchronizing access to per-CPU data structures, as
	  well as preventing recursion in interrupt processing.  Currently,
	  critical sections disable interrupts on the CPU.  In previous
	  versions of FreeBSD (4.x and before), optimizations were present
	  that allowed for software interrupt disabling, which lowers the
	  cost of critical sections in the common case by avoiding expensive
	  microcode operations on the CPU.  By restoring this model, or a
	  variation on it, critical sections can be made substantially
	  cheaper to enter.  In particular, this change will lower the cost
	  of critical sections on UP such that it is approximately the same
	  cost as a mutex, meaning that optimizations on SMP to use critical
	  sections instead of mutexes will not harm UP performance.  This
	  change has now been committed, and will appear in 6.0-RELEASE. </td>

    <h2>Netperf Cluster</h2>

    <p>Through the generous donations and investment of Sentex Data
      Communications, FreeBSD Systems, IronPort Systems, and the FreeBSD
      Foundation, a network performance testbed has been created in Ontario,
      Canada for use by FreeBSD developers working in the area of network
      performance.  A similar cluster, made possible through the generous
      donation of Verio, is being prepared for use in more general SMP
      performance work in Virginia, US.  Each cluster consists of several SMP
      systems inter-connected with giga-bit ethernet such that relatively
      arbitrary topologies can be constructed in order to test host-host, IP
      forwarding, and bridging performance scenarios.  Systems are network
      booted, have serial console, and remote power, in order to maximize
      availability and minimize configuration overhead.  These systems are
      available on a check-out basis for experimentation and performance
      measurement to FreeBSD developers working on the Netperf project, and
      in related areas.</p>

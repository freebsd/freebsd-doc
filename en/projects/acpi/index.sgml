    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The acpi driver provides support for the Intel/Microsoft/Compaq/Toshiba
    ACPI standard. This support includes platform hardware discovery (superseding
    the PnP and PCI BIOS), as well as power management (superseding
    APM) and other features. ACPI core support is provided by the ACPI-CA
    reference implementation from Intel.</p>

    <p>Information on using and debugging ACPI can be found in the
      <a href="/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/acpi-debug.html">
      handbook entry</a> and
      <a href="/cgi/man.cgi?query=acpi&amp;sektion=4&amp;format=html">man page</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for the list of completed projects not located
      on this page, it can be found

	  <td> Implement X suspend/resume notification.  Currently,
	    the X server on FreeBSD is not notified of a suspend.
	    We explicitly switch to a VTY on syscons before resume
	    to get the server to save and then restore all the registers.
	    This works for many systems but not if the display is left in
	    less initialized at resume than the VTY switch code can handle.
	    There is an interface (in the X server bsd_apm.c) for doing ioctls
	    to find out about the suspend.  First, check if this file is
	    built on FreeBSD as it appears to only be built on NetBSD.
	    Then implement the ioctls in both apm and acpi (on the apm
	    compat device).
	    <a href="http://www.root.org/~nate/freebsd/bsd_apm.diff">Here is a
	    patch</a> to help the X file compile.  For acpi, we do not want
	    a user process dying to hold up the suspend process so implement
	    the notification with a timeout.  That is, if the kernel generates
	    a APM_STANDBY_REQ notification and it doesn't receive a
	    APM_IOC_STANDBY within say 5 seconds, continue the suspend process.
	    This is needed for standby when X is not running, for instance, or
	    when an emergency suspend is generated by a battery going
	    critical.</td>

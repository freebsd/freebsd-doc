<p>The FreeBSD Project was a successful mentoring organization in the
  Google <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of
  Code</a>.  This program funds students to contribute to an open
  source project over the summer break.  We had dozens of successful
  students working on FreeBSD as part of this program in <a
  href="&base;/summerofcode-2005.html">2005</a> and <a
  href="&base;/summerofcode-2006.html">2006</a>.</p>

<a name="ideas"></a>
<h2>Example Proposal Ideas</h2>

<p>Please see the general <a
  href="&base;/projects/ideas/index.html">FreeBSD Project Ideas</a>
  page. The recent <a href="&base;/news/status">Developer Status
  Reports</a> are also a good source of information about upcoming
  projects.  A Summer of Code-specific addendum may be posted here in
  Spring 2007.</p>

<a name="mentors"></a>
<h2>Mentors</h2>

<p>A list of potential mentors will be posted here when the 2007
  program is announced.</p>

<a name="proposals"></a>
<h2>Proposal Guidelines</h2>

<p>Students are responsible for writing a proposal and submitting it
  to Google before the application deadline.  The following outline
  was adapted from the Perl Foundation <a
  href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/proposals.html">open
  source proposal HOWTO</a>.  A strong proposal will include:</p>


  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Email</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Project Title</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Possible Mentor</strong> <em>(optional)</em></li>

    <li><strong>Benefits to the FreeBSD Community</strong> - a good
      project will not just be fun to work on, but also generally
      useful to others.</li>

    <li><strong>Deliverables</strong> - It is very important to list
  quantifiable results here e.g. 
      <ul>
        <li>"Improve X modules in ways Y and Z."</li>
        <li>"Write 3 new man pages for the new interfaces."</li>
        <li>"Improve test coverage by writing X more unit/regression
        tests."</li>
        <li>"Improve performance in FOO by X%."</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Project Schedule</strong> - How long will the project
      take? When can you begin work?</li>

    <li><strong>Availability</strong> - How many hours per week can
      you spend working on this?  What other obligations do you have
      this summer?</li>

    <li><strong>Bio</strong> - Who are you? What makes you the best
      person to work on this project?</li>
  </ul>

<a name="infrastructure"></a>
<h2>Infrastructure Provided to Students</h2>

<p>In 2005 and 2006, the FreeBSD Project provided access to the FreeBSD
Perforce revision control infrastructure in order to facilitate
student collaboration, provide public access and archiving for the
on-going student projects, and to help mentors and the community
monitor on-going work.  It is expected that students participating in
future programs will be offered the same facilities.
Students will also be asked to maintain wiki
pages on their on-going projects.  In the past, e-mail, IRC, and
instant messaging have proven popular among students and mentors, and
students participating in the FreeBSD summer program are encouraged to
use these and other electronic communication mechanisms to become
active in the community.</p>

<a name="faq"></a>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>What about Summer of 2007?</strong></p>

    <p>We again hope to be able to work with Google and participate in
a sponsored Google Summer of Code program in 2007.  Please check
back in Spring 2007 for details.</p>

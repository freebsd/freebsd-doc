	FreeBSD Security How-To</a>
	FreeBSD is a very secure operating system. Since source code
	is freely available, the OS is constantly going through the
	review and audit. While FreeBSD comes very secure OOB
	(Out-Of-Box), there are many features that can make it more
	secure for those of you who are "paranoid". This How-To will
	go over some steps which will help you increase overall

	Other planned and implemented things are all the normal management
	tools and a server.

      <li><a name="coda" href="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">Coda</a> is

	A Solution to the Metadata Update Problem in File Systems</li>

      <li><a name="tcfs" href="http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/">TCFS</a>
	is a Transparent Cryptographic File System that is a suitable
	solution to the problem of privacy for distributed file system. By a
	deeper integration between the encryption service and the file system,
	it results in a complete trasparency of use to the user
	applications. Files are stored in encrypted form and are decrypted
	before they are read. The encryption/decryption process takes place on
	the client machine and thus the encryption/decryption key never
	travels on the network.</li>

      <li><a name="Tertiary" href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Td/">Tertiary Disk</a>
	is a storage system architecture to create large disk storage systems
	that avoid the disadvantages of custom built disk arrays. The
	name comes from twin goals: to have the cost per megabyte and
	capacity of tape libraries and the performance of magnetic
	disks. We use commodity, off the shelf components to develop a
	scalable, low cost, terabyte capacity disk system. Our target is
	to build a complete storage system with about 30-50% extra to
	the cost of the raw disk.  Tertiary Disk uses PCs connected by a
	switched network to host a large number of disks. Our prototype
	consists of 20 200MHz PC PCs, which host 370 8GB disks. The PCs
	are connected through a 100Mbps Ethernet switch.</li>
      
      <li><a name="vinum" href="http://www.lemis.com/vinum.html">Vinum</a>
	is a logical volume manager modeled after the VERITAS volume manager.
	However, it is not a clone of Veritas, and attempts to solve a
	number of problems more elegantly than Veritas.  It also offers
	features that Veritas does not have.</li>

      <li><a name="PathConvert" href="http://www.tamacom.com/pathconvert/">

      <li><a name="v9fs" href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/~rminnich/">
      V9FS: Memory-based file system for FreeBSD</a> It will (we hope)
      become the basis of private name spaces for FreeBSD in the
      future. It provides a file system that uses only memory for
      directories, inodes, and data.  This is not at all like mfs,
      since mfs uses memory for "disk blocks", and essentially acts as
      the device for UFS. V9FS in contrast is a first-class citizen
      and is a full mountable file system. No writeup yet.</li>

<a name="kernelandsecurity"></a>
<h3>Kernel, security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="drawbridge" href="http://drawbridge.tamu.edu/">Drawbridge</a>
	is a firewall package that was developed at Texax A&amp;M University and
	was designed with a large academic environment in mind.  It's greatest

	a larget number of individual hosts within an intranetwork.</li>

      <li><a name="hardening" href="http://www.watson.org/fbsd-hardening/">FreeBSD Hardening Project</a>
	The goal of the FreeBSD Hardening Project is to develop a set of
	modifications to the base FreeBSD system that, when applied, allow
	for a far more secure environment.  Services would, in general, be
	disabled until specifically enabled, much like modern firewall
	policies.</li>

      <li><a name="lotteryscheduling"
      href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/computing/software/lottery-sched.html">
      Lottery Scheduling Kernel</a>: This work is based on
      Waldspurger's lottery scheduling algorithm, which implements
      proportional-share resource management. The primary advantages
      are that users have strict control over the relative execution
      rates of their processes, and users are load-insulated from each
      other, preventing one user from dominating the CPU.</li>

<h3>Device drivers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="fdd" href="http://www.posi.net/freebsd/drivers/">BSD Driver Database</a>
Just because you don't have the time to write the driver
yourself doesn't mean you can't still help. The idea behind
the BSD Driver Database is to help individuals with
hardware that needs supporting get in touch with driver
developers with the knowledge to write the support for the
hardware. This is a list of drivers currently under
development that could stand to gain from time or resources
you may have to offer.

      <li><a name="atm" href="http://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/pub/chuck/tech/bsdatm/bsdatm.html"> BSD ATM: implementation of ATM internetworking under 4.4BSD</a>:
	New computer applications in areas such as multimedia, imaging,
	and distributed computing demand high levels of performance from
	computer networks. ATM-based networking solutions provide one
	possible alternative to meeting these performance needs.
	However, the complexity of ATM over traditional networks such as
	Ethernet has proven to be a barrier to its being used. In this
	paper we present the design and implementation of BSD ATM, a
	light-weight and efficient ATM software layer for BSD-based
	operating systems that requires minimal changes to the operating
	system. BSD ATM can be used both for IP-based networking traffic
	and for ``native'' ATM traffic.</li>

	ISDN4BSD (or i4b for short) is a package for interfacing a computer
	running FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, or BSD/OS to ISDN.  The only ISDN
	protocol currently supported is the BRI protocol.  ISDN4BSD allows you
	to make IP network connections by using either IP packets sent in raw
	HDLC frames on the B channel, or by using sychronous PPP.  For

	SCO UnixWare and SCO OpenServer binaries.</li>

      <li><a name="oskit" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flexmach/oskit/">The OSKit</a>
	The OSKit is a framework and a set of 31 component libraries oriented
	to operating systems, together with extensive documentation. By
	providing in a modular way not only most of the infrastructure
	"grunge" needed by an OS, but also many higher-level components, the
	OSKit's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to
	lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS,
	port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other
	architectures supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a
	wider range of devices, file system formats, executable formats, or
	network services. The OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related
	programs, such as boot loaders or OS-level servers atop a
	microkernel.</li>

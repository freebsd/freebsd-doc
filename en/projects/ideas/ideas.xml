      <title>FAT (msdosfs) infrastructure work</title>

      <desc>
<p><strong>Technical Contact</strong>: <a
  href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">Robert Watson</a></p>
<p>The FreeBSD FAT implementation, msdosfs, offers scope for a number of
  projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General cleanup.</li>
  <li>Introduce appropriate locking to make the file system operate without
    the Giant lock (MPSAFE).</li>
  <li>Make msdosfs robust in the presence of unexpected disk removal, since
    it is frequently used with removable devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is unclear to what extent the last of these items, arguably the most
  useful, will require modifying surrounding infrastructure such as BIO,
  GEOM, and VM.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong C programming skills.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with concurrent programming techniques.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with FAT file system layout.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with virtual file system and virtual memory.</li>

      <desc><p>The section <emph>8.3 Naming</emph> of the book
        <emph>Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System</emph>
        describes the current approach of name lookups in UFS2 and a possible
        extension/improvement by utilizing on-disk indexing in a backward
        compatible way. While the current approach (an in-memory directory cache)
        is 90% effective when hit, it is only applicable to 25% of name lookups.

      <title>Port NetBSD's ext2fs and teach it to use gjournal</title>

      <desc><p>FreeBSD has an implementation of the ext2fs filesystems
        but it contains some files under the GPL which make it undesirable,
        among other things, to use it in the GENERIC kernel. Ext2fs is a rather
        simple but practical filesystem and NetBSD has had for <a
        href="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200006/ext2fs.html">a while</a>
        an <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/ufs/ext2fs/">
        implementation</a> based on UFS1 sources. Linux has several
        interesting filesystems but most distributions seem to be gravitating
        towards ext3fs, which supports the same on-disk format as ext2fs and
        adds journalling. Porting NetBSD's ext2fs and adding support for in
        gjournal (if possible) would make an excellent combination. Other

        other strategies that would be useful, especially when working
        with small files. Quoting Greg Ganger: "The key insight for why
        current file systems perform poorly is that locality is insufficient
        - exploiting disk bandwidth for small data objects requires that
        they be placed adjacently". Explicit grouping, in particular, seems
        to provide important performance improvements without less
        implementation complexity than embedded inodes. As this changes
        the on-disk structure, care needs to be taken that the
        implementation is backwards compatible.</p>

      <title>Automated kernel crash reporting system</title>

      <desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:delphij@FreeBSD.org">Xin LI</a>, <a
  href="mailto:howardsu@FreeBSD.org">Howard SU</a></p>

<p>In some recent operating systems, it is common that crashes are
  automatically reported to its vendor, which is very helpful for
  finding hidden problems that can not be easily triggered by usual
  test cases.  Newer GNOME applications also has similar functionalities.</p>

<p>This project would consist two parts.  One is some improvements over
  the current savecore rc.d script to teach it how to collect necessary
  information (of course, automatic reporting has to be explicitly enabled
  by individual system administrators, and should have at least three
  options: not to send out anything at all as a default, send out after
  administrator confirmation, and automatically send all necessary information)</p>

<p>Another part is the server side one, which will keep a database of backtraces
  where similar (call stack minus addresses) reports are kept together and be
  considered as a "vote", to make it possible for developers and release engineers
  to focus on the most commonly triggered issues.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong knowledge of C.</li>
  <li>Understanding of kernel debugging.</li>
  <li>Knowledge about web application as well as database.</li>
  <li>Understanding of user privacy protection.</li>

      <title>Avoiding syscall overhead</title>

      <desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:kris@FreeBSD.org">Kris Kennaway</a></p>

<p>setproctitle() calls are a serious
  performance bottleneck in a default pgsql configuration (they are
  called at least once per query, which might be thousands of times per
  second - I measured a performance impact of about 33% on sysbench).</p>

<p>One idea for avoiding the syscall (and global sysctl lock) overhead
  for this kind of thing would be a memory page shared between kernel
  and userland which libc could read/write to access things like the
  process title.  There are potentially many other data values that
  could be optimized by a similar method.  This is presumably a well
  established technique in other OSes.</p>

<p>This project requires mentoring/review/planning with someone with
  significant VM experience to make sure this approach
  works properly.  Done incorrectly, this could result in fairly
  massive security holes, performance issues (perhaps not visible in
  simple benchmarks), etc.</p>

<p>Kernel modules may have dynamic references created during operation.

      <title>Kernel support for linux device drivers</title>

      <desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:luigi@FreeBSD.org">Luigi Rizzo</a></p>

<p>Recently, a project was started to compile linux device drivers
  on FreeBSD through an in-kernel emulation layer, which
  implements part of the linux kernel API on top of the FreeBSD
  kernel API.  The initial implementation was good enough to
  support a few USB webcam drivers, and is documented 
  <a
href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/FreeBSD/linux_bsd_kld.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to extend this emulation layer
  to cover more of the linux kernel API. Two areas that need
  further work are the API used by network/communication device drivers (e.g.
  many USB wired and wireless device drivers; telephony cards), and the API used
  by memory-mapped devices and drivers (e.g. analog or DVB video
  acquisition cards, both USB and PCI).</p>

<p>A Summer of Code applicant would be required to choose a significant set of
  extensions to the existing work (e.g. one of those indicated
  above), and select at least two linux device drivers to be
  ported to FreeBSD using the newly implemented functions.</p>

<p>Before the start of the project a Summer of Code applicant is expected to
  have studied the above URL and understood the emulation technique
  used, and to have/acquire access to at least some of the hardware
  involved, so that actual functionality tests can be performed
  in addition to the compile tests.</p>

	<title>Extend ktrace/kdump output</title>

	<desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a
  href="mailto:netchild@FreeBSD.org">Alexander Leidinger</a></p>
<p>The ktrace(1) facility allows to monitor what running processes do.  It
  allows to determine if a process is stuck or if it still does useful work.
  The goal of this item is to look at the kernel interfaces, add missing
  "pieces" (e.g. syscall's) to the ktrace output and to extend the output
  with "decoded" (translating hex/dec values into human readable
  information, e.g. O_RDONLY in the case of open(2)) information.  Some work
  has been completed and committed, but a few parts still remains.  More
  information is available <a
  href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-arch/2006-April/005107.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, a related project would be to modify ktrace to write to pipes.
  Currently the ktrace infrastructure requires the dump output go to a file.
  It would be useful to be able to instead have it write to pipe, or in fact
  any type of file descriptor.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>

  <a href="mailto:jeff@FreeBSD.org">Jeff Roberson</a>
<p>The instruction pair sysenter and sysexit can contribute to certain
  performance improvements when a syscall is made on IA32.  There is however
  no implementation of this available for FreeBSD, so a volunteer
  would have to add sysenter/sysexit support to the kernel.  This
  needs to be properly evaluated and benchmarked though, so a complete
  implementation should therefore also contain informative benchmarks which
  shows a clear improvement in performance.  It is also important to stress
  the fact that this project is of research quality and measures should be
  taken to ensure that no regressions are introduced.  Another interesting
  extension to this project would be to investigate and evaluate the
  possibility to use mmx/xmm registers to gather syscalls arguments.

      <title>Improving the USB stack in FreeBSD</title>

      <desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:luigi@FreeBSD.org">Luigi Rizzo</a></p>

  <p>The USB stack in FreeBSD suffers from a few problems, including
    lack of functionality (e.g. isochronous support for USB2 devices),
    lack of documentation (most of the code is undocumented and
    derives from other BSD implementations), lack of support (there
    is not, to our knowledge, active development of the stack),
    and the fact that it is still running under the Giant lock.</p>

  <p>There is an alternate USB stack under development but it also
    suffers from its own share of problems: while it supports
    isochronous transfers for USB2 and does not run under Giant, it is
    also almost completely undocumented, and it exports a different API
    from the current one, which in turn causes portability problems for
    device drivers that run on top of USB. Additionally, it is not in
    widespread use.</p>

  <p>The goal of this project is to improve the FreeBSD stack in one
    of the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add documentation and isochronous USB2 transfers to the existing
      driver. Documentation also includes a detailed description of the
      locking requirements to ease the move to a different locking
      architecture;</li>
    <li>Add documentation and a compatibility layer to the 'new' usb
      stack, and verify that the basic functionality is preserved for
      widely used drivers (umass, mouse, keyboard, etc.).
      This work will likely require some debugging of the new code
      which we expect to be less tested than the existing one, and so
      more prone to undetected bugs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The production of suitable documentation in the source is a key
   requirement of the project.</p>

  starve other processes.  It is available as a patch for RELENG_4 and
  RELENG_5.  Unfortunately the code in FreeBSD-current (and RELENG_6)
  changed too much, so that the patches can not be committed.  The goal
  of this project is to port the pluggable disk schedulers to the GEOM

<p>WPA2 is the authentication protocol defined as part of the IEEE 802.11i

  wireless stations to access points.  Part of this protocol is the
  ability to pre-authenticate a station with one or more access points
  so that roaming can happen quickly.  FreeBSD lacks support for this
  aspect of the protocol in the hostapd program used to construct a
  WPA-enabled access point.  This task would port the Linux code that

<p>pkg_create(1) and friends use flat databases (aka ordinary

  portupgrade has the right idea of hashing this into a berkeley db
  file, but it uses tools that are not in the base system (ruby).</p>
<p>A self-contained project would be to add similar (preferably
  compatible) code into pkg_tools directly, possibly also extending
  the data that is stored and allowing for more flexible querying with
  tools like pkg_info (e.g. replicating the pkg_which utility of
  portupgrade).  Adding mutual exclusion to protect concurrent
  pkg_add/delete operations from corrupting database state is also

  <li>Better handling of cases where OPTIONS are changed/added/removed
    between upgrades.</li>
  <li>The ability to depend on, or at least test, OPTIONS set in other
    ports.  Possibly it would be nice to enforce setting variables that are
    depended upon when the port is being installed as a dependency.</li>
  <li>Other types of OPTIONS controls - A text box in particular would be

	<desc>
	  <p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a
	    href="mailto:pav@FreeBSD.org">Pav Lucistnik</a></p>

	  <p>Add locking of write access to PKG_DBDIR (/var/db/pkg), to allow
	    several port builds run in parallel without clobbering the package
	    data.  Should be done both in makefiles and in C tools like
	    pkg_install and pkg_delete.  A simple flock(2) approach over the
	    whole database comes to mind.</p>

	  <p>The next step is the parallelization of dependency building.  Have
	    the port build it's dependencies in parallel, automatically
	    depending on number of CPUs in the machine, or manually specified
	    by user (make -j3 install clean).  Some kind of split screen should
	    be devised, so user can easily watch the process and interact with
	    it (make config screens, for example).  Attention must be paid to
	    prevent deadlocks.</p>

	  <p>Allow for situation when two ports want to build and install
	    common dependency.  One of the ports have to wait on the other to
	    install it before proceeding.</p>

	  <p>And finally, unrelated to previous steps, but also desirable.  Add
	    parallelization inside single builds, ie. enable -jX flag inside
	    vendor makefiles.  This will allow us to exploit the power of

<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a

<p>
A number of kernel security subsystems, such as IPFW and pf, generate
security log data.  This task involves identifying potential sources of
security event information in the kernel and modifying kernel subsystems to
log that information using the kernel security event auditing system.
User and programmer documentation of audit may be found on the <a
href="http://www.trustedbsd.org/docs.html">TrustedBSD Documentation Page</a>.
There are also extensive manual pages relating to audit in FreeBSD.  This
project will require careful security analysis and kernel programming, and
will likely need some re-working of the kernel audit framework (which is
currently entirely focused on gathering user and kernel system call audit
data).

	<title>Mandatory Access Control</title>
	<desc>
<p><strong>Technical contact</strong>: <a
  href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">Robert Watson</a></p>
<p>
FreeBSD 5.0 was the first FreeBSD release to ship with support for Mandatory
Access Control (MAC), an access control technology allowing system
administrators to implement multi-level security, integrity protection, and
other "mandatory" policies.  Policies may be compiled into the kernel, or
loaded as loadable kernel modules.
Later revisions of FreeBSD and the MAC Framework enhanced MAC support,
and additional policy modules were made available, such as a port of the
SELinux FLASK/TE framework available as a third party policy module.
However, many of the sample MAC modules included with FreeBSD are considered
experimental examples of what the technology can be used for, rather than
production policies.
For example, the Biba integrity policy can be deployed in production, but
requires significant tuning to do so effectively.
</p>
<p>
This task involves a general review of the MAC Framework and Policy modules,
with the goal of identifying improvement areas.  It also involves specific
cleanups, optimizations, and completeness work on specific policy modules --
most importantly, the Biba and MLS sample labeled policy modules.  Work there
includes improving memory overhead and efficiency; for example, moving from
allocating complete labels for every labeled object to referencing common
label storage where labels are identical, which occurs a great deal of the
time in most systems.
Other cleanups include moving towards a canonical/extensible on-disk label
storage format, adding regression tests, investigating interactions with user
applications, and writing documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong C programming skills.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with OS security policies, including discretionary and

FreeBSD is undergoing constant and active improvement to all of its critical
subsystems, from file systems to the network stack.  With any change, there
is a risk of introducing bugs or regressions.  The goal of this task is to
produce a security regression test suite, which encapsulates requirements
regarding system security properties and tests that they (still) hold.  Areas
to test include file system access control, privilege, authentication,
cryptography, process containment, and more.  There are some current tests
along these lines in the <a

regression test tree</a>, but they are both incomplete and and inadequate.
New tests must be created; existing tests must be completed and updated.

    <p>The following resources are some of those which FreeBSD
      newbies have found most helpful when learning to use FreeBSD.
      Please send corrections and additions to
      <a href="mailto:freebsd-newbies@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD-Newbies@FreeBSD.org</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="web-site">Using the FreeBSD web site</a></h2>
    
    <p>This web site is the main source of up to date information about
      FreeBSD. Newbies have found the following pages particularly helpful:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="../search/search.html">Search</a> the Handbook and FAQ, or the
	  whole web site, or the archives of the FreeBSD-Questions mailing
	  list.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The <a href="../docs.html">Documentation</a> page has links to the
	  Handbook and FAQ, tutorials, information about contributing to the
	  Documentation Project, documents in languages other than English,
	  and much more.</p></li>
      
      <li><p><a href="../support.html">Support</a> page contains a wealth of
	  information about FreeBSD, including mailing lists, user groups, web
	  and FTP sites, release information, and links to some sources of
	  UNIX information.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="fbsd">Learning about FreeBSD</a></H2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>If you haven't installed yet, look for the
          &a.latest.ann;latest mainstream release</a>.
          (See the Handbook for why you should <strong>not</strong> be tempted
          by any of the other branches.) Before you begin, carefully read the
          <a href="../handbook/install.html">installation instructions</a>,
          as well as each one of the *.TXT files in the FTP directory
          or on the installation CD. They are there because they contain information
          that you will need. Also pick up the latest
          <a href="../releases/index.html">errata file</a>
          from the web site, in case it has been updated.</p>

         <p>If you decide to download FreeBSD, check whether these illustrated and
          expanded <a href="http://www.lemis.com/handbook/what-to-download.html">download
          instructions</a> for a previous version are still available before
          you begin. That should make the whole process a lot clearer.</p></li>

      <li><p>A number of <a href="../tutorials/">tutorials</a> are available. The
	  one <a href="../tutorials/new-users/">For People New to Both
	    FreeBSD and Unix</a> is popular with absolute beginners. You don't
	  have to know much about anything to enjoy this one. It is also
	  available from <a
	    href="http://andrsn.stanford.edu/FreeBSD/newuser.html">the
	    author's site</a> and can be downloaded in <a
	    href="ftp://andrsn.stanford.edu/pub/">postscript or RTF format</a>
	  for printing.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The first thing many people need to set up is ppp, and there is
          a lot of documentation to help. You might start with at least those
          parts of the
          <a href="../tutorials/ppp/ppp.html">Pedantic PPP Primer</a>
          that are relevant to your needs, and explore the
          <a href="http://www.awfulhak.org/ppp.html">ppp page</a>
          for links to the other valuable information and the latest updates.</p></li>

      <li><p><a name="cfbsd" href="http://www.cdrom.com/titles/freebsd/bsdbook2.phtml">The
	    Complete FreeBSD</a> by Greg Lehey, published by Walnut Creek
	  CDROM. This book assumes minimal UNIX experience and takes the
	  beginner step by step through each stage from installation to
	  everything you need to know to set up and run a FreeBSD system. You
	  also get to understand what you're doing and why.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The <a href="../handbook/">FreeBSD Handbook</a> and <a
	    href="../FAQ/FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> are the
	  main documents for FreeBSD. Essential reading, they contain a lot of
	  material for newbies as well as some pretty advanced stuff. Don't
	  worry if you can't understand the advanced sections. The handbook
	  contains the installation instructions and also provides lists of
	  books and on line resources, and the FAQ has a troubleshooting
	  section.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Join the FreeBSD-Questions mailing list to see the questions you
	  were too afraid to ask, and their answers. Subscribe by sending mail
	  to <a href="mailto:majordomo@FreeBSD.org">majordomo@FreeBSD.org</a>
	  with "subscribe freebsd-questions" on its own in the message body
	  (the subject doesn't matter). You can look up old questions and
	  answers via the <a href="../search/search.html#mailinglists">search</a>
	  page.</p></li>
    
      <li><p>The main newsgroup for FreeBSD is <a
	    href="news:comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc">comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc</a>. You might want to keep an eye on <a href="news:comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.announce">comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.announce</a> as well.</p></li>
      
      <li><p><strong>Man pages</strong> are good for reference but not always
	  the best introduction for a novice. The more you work with man pages
	  the more familiar they become. Some are very good for newbies, so
	  always check them out. The ppp man page, for example, is more like a
	  tutorial.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="unix">Learning about UNIX</a></h2>

    <p>Many of the problems we have as newbies come from being unfamiliar
      with the UNIX commands needed to fix our FreeBSD problems.
      Without a UNIX background you'll be faced with two things to learn
      at once. Fortunately a lot of resources are available to make this
      easier.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>There are many easy books, such as the "Dummies" guides, in any
	  large book shop. If you want something really easy, take a look at
	  what is available and pick one that seems to speak your language.
	  Pretty soon you will want to move on to a book that gives more
	  coverage.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>One book mentioned frequently by newbies is <a name="ufti"><em>UNIX for
	  the Impatient</em></a> by Paul W. Abrahams and Bruce R. Larson, published
	  by Addison-Wesley. It is intended both as a book for learning UNIX
	  and a reference, and includes an introduction to UNIX concepts and
	  handy chapter on using the X Window System.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Another popular book is <em>UNIX Power Tools</em> by Jerry Peek,
	  Tim O'Reilly and Mike Loukides, published by O'Reilly and
	  Associates. It is organised as a series of short articles each of
	  which solves a problem, and these articles are cross-referenced to
	  other articles with related material. Though not specifically aimed
	  at newbies, the design makes it ideal for a newbie with a burning
	  question or the odd few minutes to browse. More elementary material
	  is near the front of the book, but there are short easy articles
	  throughout.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>A <a
	    href="http://www-wks.acs.ohio-state.edu/unix_course/unix.html">UNIX Introductory Course</a>
           from Ohio State University is available online in HTML,
           postscript and Acrobat PDF formats.</p></li>
      
      <li><p><a href="http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk/~unixhelp/servers.html">UNIXhelp
	    for Users</a> is another introductory guide which is available in
	  HTML at a mirror site near you, or can be installed on your own
	  system.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>UNIX questions are dealt with in the newsgroup <a
	    href="news:comp.unix.questions">comp.unix.questions</a> and the
	  associated <a
	  href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/faq/top.html"> Frequently Asked Questions</a>. You can also get a copy of the <a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/">FAQ</a>
          from the RMIT FTP site. Newbies are likely to be most interested in
          sections 1 and 2 initially.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Another interesting newsgroup is <a
	    href="news:comp.unix.user-friendly">comp.unix.user-friendly</a>
	  which also has a  <a
	    href="http://www.camelcity.com/~noel/usenet/cuuf-FAQ.htm">FAQ</a>.
	  Although this newsgroup is for discussing user-friendliness, it can
	  contain some good information for newbies. The <a
	    href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/user-friendly">FAQ</a> is also available by FTP.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Many other web sites hold lists of UNIX tutorials and reference
	  material. One of the best places to start looking is the UNIX page
	  at <a
	    href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/">Yahoo!</a>.</p></li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="xwin">Learning about the X Window System</a></h2>

    <p>The X Window System is used with a number of operating systems,
      including FreeBSD. The documentation for X can be found at
      <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">The XFree86 Project, Inc.</a>,
      including the
      <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/index.html">XFree86 FAQ</a>.
      Beware, much of this documentation is reference material which is
      likely to be difficult for newcomers to digest.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>For basic information about installing, configuring and using the
      X Window System, two of the books mentioned above have sections
      dealing with X at beginner level:
      <a href="#cfbsd">The Complete FreeBSD</a> and
      <a href="#ufti">UNIX for the Impatient</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p>There is an easy and informative section on
      <a href="http://linuxwww.db.erau.edu/LUG/node41.html">using
      the X Window System</a> in the Linux
      <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/users-guide">Users' Guide</a>.
      Interesting material will be found elsewhere in that document too, but
      remember that Linux does not always work exactly the same as FreeBSD.</p></li>

    <li><p>Before you can get X running exactly the way you like, you will need
      to choose a window manager.
      Visit the <a href="http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/">Window Managers for X</a>
      page and follow the link to the introduction to find out about window
      managers, then return and read "The Basics". Then go back and compare
      the different types that are available. (Bonus: there's another
      beginners guide to UNIX there too.)
      Most if not all of these window managers are available to
      install from the FreeBSD ports collection.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="people">Helping other people</a></h2>

    <p>Everyone has something to contribute to the FreeBSD community, even
     newbies! Some are busy working with the new advocacy group and some have
     become involved with the
     <a href="../docproj/docproj.html">Documentation Project</a> as reviewers.
     Other FreeBSD newbies might have particular skills and experiences to
     share, either computer related or not, or just want to meet new
     newbies and make them feel welcome. There's always people around
     who help others simply because they like to. Write to
     <a href="mailto:freebsd-newbies@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Newbies</a>
     for more information.</p>

    <p>Friends who run FreeBSD are a great resource. No book can replace
      chatting on the phone or across a pizza with someone who has the
      same interests, enjoys similar accomplishments, and faces the same
      challenges. If you don't have many friends who use FreeBSD,
      consider using your old FreeBSD CDs to create some more :-)</p>

    <p><a href="../support.html#user">User groups</a> are
      good places to meet other FreeBSD users. If there's not one nearby,
      maybe you could start one.</p>
    
    <p>Before talking to real humans about your new skills, you might
      want to check the <a
      href="http://manuel.brad.ac.uk/help/.faq/.unix/.pronun.html">Pronunciation Guide</a>
      and the <a
      href="http://www.wins.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/">Jargon File</a> :-)</p>

    <p>On line we have the
      <a href="http://www.welearn.com.au/freebsd/newbies/">FreeBSD-Newbies</a>
      mailing list for non-technical discussions about matters of interest
      to newbies. Another mailing list,
      <a href="mailto:questions@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD-Questions</a>,
      answers our questions about using FreeBSD.</p>

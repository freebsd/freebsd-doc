    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>The FreeBSD Binary Updater Project aims to provide a secure
      mechanism for the distribution of binary updates for FreeBSD.
      This project is complementary to the <a
      href="http://www.openpackages.org">Open Packages</a> and
      <a href="libh.html">libh</a> projects efforts and there should be
      very little overlap.</p>

    <p>This system is a client / server mechanism that allows clients
      to install any known "profile" or release of FreeBSD over the
      network.  Where a specific profile might contain a specific set
      of FreeBSD software to install, additional packages, and
      configuration actions that make it more ideal for a specific
      environment (ie FreeBSD 4.3 Secure Web server profile)</p>

    <p>Our current implementation aims to abstract the actual ontology
      of the FreeBSD software collections so that future development
      in the direction of a more fine grained base system can be
      leveraged effectively without unnecessary reimplementation.</p>

    <a name="design"></a>
    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>"Profiles"</h3>

    <p>What the user sees as "top level objects" in the upgrade system
      are canned profiles.  A profile can represent a given user's
      system configuration or a generic system template (web server,
      mail server, etc) that we provide.</p>

    <p>Each profile consists of file entries and/or collection
      entries.  A collection entry represents a grouped set of files
      like a package or what sysinstall calls a "distribution."
      Profiles exist on the server machine, though the client can also
      choose to cache copies for "tripwire" types of activities.  Some
      typical profiles and their contents might look like this:</p>

<pre>
       [mysystem]                        [web-server]
        bin  4.2                          bin	   4.2
        bash 2.02                         manpages 4.2
        src  4.2                          apache   2.1
        xblaster 1.0
</pre>

    <p>A collection can also have a specific version number associated
      with it or have a "floating" version number, meaning that it
      tracks whatever's newest for that entity.</p>

    <p>Authentication</p>

    <p>Users will authenticate with the server via a username /
      password scheme which allows them to access their custom
      profiles as well as any system-defined ones.</p>

    <p>Binary packages from the server are signed using public key
      cryptography.</p>

    <h3>Upgrade Client</h3>

    <p>The client supports connecting to an upgrade server,
      authenticating a user, browsing existing profiles or creating
      new ones and downloading file data and "actions" from the
      server.  New file data will be created in such a way that
      partial updates do not cause corruption and whole transactions
      are committed in reasonably atomic fashion.</p>

    <p>The client will be implemented in a 3-stage process:</p>

    <ul>
     <li>A set of libraries which implement the bulk of the
       client<->server mutt functionality.</li>

     <li>A command-line version of the client which supports all
       available library functions.</li>

     <li>A GUI version of the client which either wraps around the
       client or calls the library routines directly, depending on
       whichever makes the most sense.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since a system can also be "upgraded" from a standing start, a
      next-generation installation tool could take care of the
      disklabelling filesystem formatting, and network setup then make
      heavy use of the client library to actually bring up a menu of
      available software and perform the installation.</p>

    <h3>Upgrade Server</h3>

    <p>The server supports connections by arbitrary numbers of clients
      and authenticating a user (or "anonymous" if the server is
      configured to support anonymous connections) for determining the
      available profiles.</p>

    <p>Once the server receives a manifest (e.g. a set of collections)
      from a client machine and a server-side profile name to match it
      with, it goes looking through each collection to see if a newer
      version of that collection exists on the server or if there are
      any change deltas pending against the collection which are
      greater than the corresponding patchlevel of the collection in
      the client manifest.</p>

    <p>Deltas and/or entire collections are sent to the client for
      unpacking along with any before/after actions for each delta or
      collection which should be executed on the client.  Once the
      client has confirmed that all before/after actions and
      extraction of a given collection has completed successfully, it
      updates the stored profile and goes on to the next.  If the
      transfer is interrupted at any point, the process can therefore
      pick up where it left off.</p>

    <p>The upgrade server provides local storage for a certain amount
      of profile data depending on disk space constraints and can also
      be used as a way of cloning machines.  The user installs one
      machine entirely according to taste and then uploads its
      profile.  Each subsequent machine is installed from this profile
      and voila, an army of clones.</p>

    <p>The server will probably not keep any truly client-side data
      like <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt> or anything else it doesn't
      offer out of its own collections, but we can leave this decision
      open for later or make it a configuration option.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

    <a name="update-server"></a>
    <h3>Update Server</h3>

    <p>The update server is for the most part in a usable state.
      Information about profiles, collections, and actions are stored
      in a SQL database.  A database abstraction layer talks calls the
      relevant hooks (MySQL and PostgreSQL supported at the moment) to
      service client requests.  Using a relational database has made
      it very easy for us to change the organization of the data
      without spending time rewriting code.  As we finalize our data
      structures it might be more efficient to move to BerkeleyDB or
      another solution but for now SQL has saved a lot of development
      time.</p>

    <p>The server can be used to successfully install or upgrade a
      system to FreeBSD 4.X but there is a lot of polishing up to do
      and many additional features are needed.</p>

    <a name="update-server-todo"></a>
    <p>Server TODO list :</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add ability to manage packages as they are currently defined
        and used in FreeBSD</li>

      <li>Add mechanism to read the ontology of the FreeBSD src tree
        from an XML file, instead of hard coding this into a Perl
        script which generates the necessary database tables.  This
        will provide much needed flexibility in the creation of
        profiles and software components.  There should also provide a
        description for packages that can obviate subsets of what
        sysinstall currently calls the "base system" (e.g, a profile
        with Postfix instead of Sendmail, and all of the configuration
        dependencies that go along with that)</li>

      <li>Add checksum information and provide a "tripwire"-like
        service to clients.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="update-client"></a>
    <h3>Update Client</h3>

    <p>The update client is not currently usable.  At the moment, it
      consists of some code to perform the actual updates, and some
      quick code to test the various functions of the updater.  Also,
      the client does not currently handle packages.  Once this
      capability has been added, and the various ugly bugs have been
      worked out, the existing code needs to be turned into a
      library.</p>

    <p>From there, it will possible to easily create an installer as
      well as an end-user upgrade program, in forms of a text
      application, an X application, and maybe even big eye candy
      GNOME and KDE applications as well.</p>

    <a name="update-client-todo"></a>
    <p>Client TODO list :</p>

    <ul>
      <li>add copyright/license information to all various source
        files</li>
      <li>conform to style(9)</li>
      <li>serious bug removal</li>
      <li>add ability to manage packages</li>
      <li>turn into a library</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="code"></a>
    <h2>Where's the Code?</h2>

      all questions, patches, etc to the <a
      href="mailto:freebsd-binup@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-binup@FreeBSD.org</a>

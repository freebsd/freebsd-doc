    <h2>NanoBSD = FreeBSD for appliance use.</h2>
    <p>
	NanoBSD is designed to put a possibly reduced FreeBSD system
	on a Compact Flash card (or other mass storage of your choice)
	in a way which is suitable for use in appliance like applications.
    <p>
	The mass storage is divided into three parts, two image partitions
	and a configuration file partition, which normally are mounted
	only read-only.  This means that it is safe to pull the power
	plug on a NanoBSD machine and that Flash based storage is not worn
	out with filesystem metadata writes.
    <p>
	Having two image partitions means that it is possible to download
	a new image while the system is running, reboot to run that new
	image and if that fails somehow, it is still possible to switch
	back to the old image partition.

    <h2>Building NanoBSD images</h2>
    <p>
	The Nanobsd build system lives in <tt>src/tools/tools/nanobsd</tt>
	and consists of makefiles and shell scripts which drives use of
	the Makefiles in the FreeBSD source tree to create a NanoBSD image.
    <p>
	The necessary commands to build a NanoBSD image are:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>cd .../src/tools/tools/nanobsd</tt>
      <li><tt>make</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>
	Depending on your machine, this will take from half an hour
	to some hours.  The process is split into a sequence of
	steps, and if errors happen underway it is generally, but
	not always possible to rectify the error and type <tt>make</tt>
	again to complete the missing steps.
    <p>
	If you want to start from scratch you have to delete all files
	and directories in the NanoBSD directory which start with an 
	underscore: <tt>rm -rf _.*</tt>
    <p>
	Here is a breakdown of the files and directories which NanoBSD
	builds, in the order they are built:
    <ul>
       <li><tt>_.bw</tt>
	<p>The output from running <tt>make buildworld</tt> in the
	source tree.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.bw.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.iw</tt>
	<p>The output from running <tt>make installworld DESTDIR=_.w</tt>
	in the source tree.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.iw.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.w</tt>
	<p>This is the directory tree into which installworld installs.
       <li><tt>_.di</tt>
	<p>The output from running <tt>make distribute DESTDIR=_.w</tt>
	in the source trees <tt>etc</tt> subdirectory.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.di.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.bk</tt>
	<p>The output from running <tt>make buildkernel</tt>
	in the source tree.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.bk.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.ik</tt>
	<p>The output from running <tt>make installkernel DESTDIR=_.w</tt>
	in the source tree.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.ik.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.cs</tt>
	<p>The output from running the customization scripts in the
	<tt>Customize</tt> subdirectory.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.cs.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.md</tt>
	<p>The output from building the image file containing the filesystem
	images of the finished NanoBSD.
	<p>If this step fails, the output is instead left
	in the file <tt>_.md.tmp</tt>
       <li><tt>_.mtree</tt>
	<p>Mtree(8) output from the files installed into the code patitions
	in the NanoBSD image.
       <li><tt>_.i</tt>
	<p>Image file containing the full disk image.  This is the image
	file you will put on the Compact Flash or other mass storage from
	which your target platform boots.
       <li><tt>_.i.s1</tt>
	<p>Image file containing just the code partition image.  This is
	image you will download to update a running system.
    </ul>
    <h2>Customizing NanoBSD images</h2>
    <p>
	This is where things get interesting, and where you will be spending
	your time when developing with NanoBSD.
    <h3>Storage media size</h3>
    <p>
	The first thing you need to configure is how much storage
	you have on your mass storage media.  NanoBSD can work out
	of the box with as little as 64MB, and if you spend time on
	it, you can cut it down even further until you end up with
	an installed system with just the kernel and two or three
	files in userland.
    <p>
	You can determine the size of the storage media with the
	diskinfo(8) command or by examining dmesg(8) or console
	output during boot.
    <p>
	Once you know the number of sectors on the entire media
	insert this in the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the definitions of
	SECTS or pass it as a command line option to make(1) when
	you build NanoBSD: <tt>MAKE SECTS=100000</tt>.
    <h3>Storage media geometry</h3>
    <p>
	Some platforms need to use CHS addressing in the bootblocks
	in which case you need to set the <tt>HD</tt> and <tt>SC</tt>
	values in the Makefile as well.  These can also be found from
	diskinfo(8), dmesg(8) or console output.  Even if your current
	platform does not need these to be set, it is always a good idea
	to do it anyway.
    <p>
	Please be aware that you have to get the values used on the
	target platform.  Putting a CF card in a USB-CF adapter will
	not result in the correct values for the geometry.
    <h3>Config partition size</h3>
    <p>
	The <tt>DATASIZE</tt> parameter controls how many sectors are
	used for the configuration partition.  Typically you will need
	very little, but depending on your application and how you
	organize things, you may want to set this higher or lower.
	Obviously, the space you use for the configuration partition
	is not available for the image partitions.
    <h3>Customize scripts</h3>
    <p>
	You can run scripts which will customize the NanoBSD image
	by listing them in the <tt>CUSTOMIZE</tt> variable in the
	Makefile.  The scripts will be given arguments to show them
	where everything is and they can do pretty much anything
	they want to do to the directory tree.
    <h3>Slimming down FreeBSD to fit</h3>
    <p>
	The <tt>make.conf</tt> file overrides the usual <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>
	and by default disables a lot of FreeBSD from the build in order to
	make it fit on 64MB devices.  Go through the list and decide if there
	are anything you want or do not want in your NanoBSD image.
    <h3>Slimming down the kernel</h3>
    <p>
	You may also want to use a kernel other than <tt>GENERIC</tt>.
	Put the config file in <tt>../../../sys/i386/conf</tt> and
	set the name in <tt>KERNCONF</tt> in <tt>make.conf</tt>.
    <p>
	You can save a couple of megabytes of space in your image by
	removing all the bits you will not need.  (How many appliances
	need support for nine different RAID controllers ?)
    <h2>Provided customize scripts</h2>
    <p>
	By default the following customize scripts are provided (but not
	called unless you list them in <tt>CUSTOMIZE</tt>.
    <h3>comconsole</h3>
    <p>
	Disables getty(8) on the VGA devices and enables console in the
	COM1 serial port.
    <h3>nobeastie</h3>
    <p>
	Disables the "beastie-menu" in the bootloader.
    <h3>NET4801</h3>
    <p>
	Disables ata-dma for the Soekris NET4801 because early hardware
	versions do not support DMA on the CF socket.

    <h2>Purpose and background</h2>
    <h3>The UFS filesystem</h3>
    <p>When the UFS filesystem was introduced to BSD in 1982, its use of 32
      bit offsets and counters to address the storage was considered to be
      ahead of its time.  Since most fixed-disk storage devices use 512 byte
      sectors, 32 bits allowed for 2 Terabytes of storage.  That was an almost
      un-imaginable quantity for the time.  But now that 250 and 400 Gigabyte
      disks are available at consumer prices, it's trivial to build a hardware
      or software based storage array that can exceed 2TB for a few thousand
      dollars.</p>

    <p>The UFS2 filesystem was introduced in 2003 as a replacement to the
      original UFS and provides 64 bit counters and offsets.  This allows for
      files and filesystems to grow to 2^73 bytes (2^64 * 512) in size and
      hopefully be sufficient for quite a long time.  UFS2 largely solved
      the storage size limits imposed by the filesystem.  Unfortunately, many
      tools and storage mechanisms still use or assume 32 bit values, often
      keeping FreeBSD limited to 2TB.</p>

    <p>We need to ensure that FreeBSD supports large storage sizes and that
      the benefits of UFS2 can actually be realized so that FreeBSD can remain
      relevant in the enterprise world.  This page describes known issues and
      limits and provides a focus for further auditing, validation, and
      fixing.</p>

    <h3>Limits on disk partitioning</h3>
    <p>The first limit that is encountered is in disk partitioning.  For x86
      and amd64 PC's, the FDISK MBR table is used by the BIOS to partition the
      disk into logical extents and identify which partition ('slice' in FreeBSD
      terms) to boot from.  The MBR is defined to use 32 bit disk offsets,
      and since it's an industry standard and interoperability is required,
      there is nothing that can be done to change this.  As long as booting a
      PC requires the MBR, the boot slice in FreeBSD is going to be limited to
      2TB.</p>

    <p>The GPT partitioning scheme was introduced with the ia64 architecture
      as an MBR replacement.  It provides 64 bit offsets and allows for an
      arbitrary number of partitions.  It also provides a compatibility mode
      with MBR where it can generate an MBR-compatible structure on the disk
      for use with systems that don't understand GPT.  However, to get the
      full benefits for boot storage, the BIOS and the FreeBSD loader must
      understand it.  For secondary storage, GPT can be used by any
      architecture regardless of BIOS or boot support.</p>

    <p>Many systems don't require an MBR or GPT, and even PCs don't require it
      if booting and inter-operating with other OS's is not required.  The next
      limit that comes in, though, is with the BSD disklabel.  This label
      defines up to 8 partitions on a disk, MBR slice, or other storage extent
      for filesystems and swap space.  Unfortunately, the on-disk format of the
      disk label again uses 32 bit quantities, so it is also limited to 2TB.
      Fixing this would require creating a new format that is incompatible
      with the old and would require an update to the FreeBSD boot loader.
      This would complicate interoperability and the upgrade path.  Also, if a
      new format is going to be created, it should also address the 8 partition
      limit that exists now.  Given these requirements, it's tempting to just
      adopt the GPT format instead for secondary storage partitioning.</p>

    <a name="testing"></a>
    <h2>Testing large capacities</h2>
    <p>Even though large drives are cheap, it still isn't always feasible or
      economical to test on real hardware.  Swap-backed memory disks, via the
      md(4) driver, can provide a good substitute for some of the testing.
      Backing with swap means that only the pages that are dirtied by data
      are actually allocated, so a multi-terabyte storage can be simulated
      with a minimal amount of physical RAM+swap.  Note that this is less true with
      UFS1 since it will initialize all of the inode blocks during newfs,
      which will dirty quite a bit of data.  But for UFS2, swap-backed md
      has the potential for working well.  Unfortunately, the kernel md driver
      has a number of 32-bit size limits of its own that need to be fixed.
      Details are provided below.</p>

    <p>It is still possible to avoid disklabels and MBRs for testing by
      using newfs directly on the raw disk or md disk.  Sysinstall can be
      tested from a running system by just selecting Expert mode and just
      performing the MBR and disklabel steps.  Beware that sysinstall might
      have other bugs that will wipe out your existing system, so care must
      be taken here!</p>

    <p>The Documentation Project is trying to use SGML as the standard method
      of representing the documentation.</p>

    <p>SGML is the <b>S</b>tandard <b>G</b>eneralised <b>M</b>arkup
      <b>L</b>anguage.</p>

    <p>In a nutshell (and apologies to any SGML purists in the audience that
      are offended) SGML is a language for writing other languages.</p>

    <p>You have probably already used SGML, but you did not know it. HTML, the
      language that web pages are written in, has a formal description. That
      description is written in SGML. When you are writing HTML you are
      <b>not</b> writing SGML (per se), but you are using a language that is
      defined using SGML.</p>

    <p>There are many, many markup languages that are defined using SGML. HTML
      is one of them. Another is called "LinuxDoc". As you can probably guess,
      it was originally created by the Linux documentation group to write
      their documentation, and the FreeBSD Documentation Project adopted it as
      well.</p>

    <p>Another markup language defined using SGML is called "DocBook". This
      is a language designed specifically for writing technical
      documentation, and as such it has many tags (the things inside the
      &lt;...&gt;) to describe technical documentation related things.</p>

    <p>For example, this is how you might write a brief paragraph in HTML
      (do not worry about the content, just look at the tags):</p>

    <pre><![ CDATA [
    <p>The system's passwords are stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. To edit
      this file you should use <b><tt>vipw</tt></b>. However, if you just
      want to add a new user you can use <b><tt>adduser</tt></b>.</p>
]]></pre>
    
    <p>The same paragraph, marked up using DocBook, looks like</p>

    <pre><![ CDATA [
    <para>The system's passwords are stored in
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>. To edit this file you should use
      <command>vipw</command>. However, if you just want to add a new user
      you can use <command>adduser</command>.</para>
]]></pre>
    
    <p>As you can see, DocBook is much more 'expressive' than HTML. In the HTML
      example the filename is marked up as being displayed in a 'typewriter'
      font. In the DocBook example the filename is marked up as being a
      'filename', the presentation of the filename is not described.</p>

    <p>There are a number of advantages to this more expressive form of
      markup:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>It is not ambiguous or inconsistent.</p> <p>You do not spend time
	  thinking "Hmm, I need to show a filename, should I use 'tt', or 'b',
	  or 'em'?"</p> <p>Instead, you just use the right tag for the right
	  job.</p>

	<p>The conversion process from DocBook to other formats (HTML,
	  Postscript, and so on) makes sure that all &lt;filename&gt;'s are
	  shown the same way.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>You stop thinking about the presentation of your document, and
	  instead concentrate on the content.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Because the documentation is not tied to any particular output
	  format, the same documentation can be produced in many different
	  formats - plain text, HTML, Postscript, RTF, PDF and so on.</p></li>

      <li><p>The documentation is more 'intelligent', so more intelligent
	  things can be done with it. For example, it becomes possible to
	  automatically produce an index of the documentation that lists every
	  command shown in the documentation.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are familiar with them, this is a bit like Microsoft Word
      stylesheets, only vastly more powerful.</p>

    <p>Of course, with this power comes a price;</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Because the number of tags you can use is much larger, it takes
	  longer to learn all of them, and how to use them effectively.</p>
	
	<p>I found the best way to learn was to read the source to lots of
	  example documents, seeing how other authors had written similar
	  information.</p></li>

      <li><p>The conversion process is not that simple.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Right now, the Project is still using LinuxDoc for the Handbook and the
      FAQ. That's changing, and in particular there's a project underway
      to convert the documentation to DocBook.</p>
  
    <h2>What if you don't know LinuxDoc/DocBook? Can you still
      contribute?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes you can. Quite definitely. Any documentation is better than no
      documentation. If you've got some documentation to contribute and it's
      not marked up in LinuxDoc or DocBook, don't worry.</p>

    <p><a href="submitting.html">Submit</a> the documentation as
      normal. Someone else on the Project will grab your committed
      documentation, mark it up for you, and commit it. With a bit of luck
      they'll then send you the marked up text back. This is handy because you
      can do a "before and after" shot of the plain documentation and the
      marked up stuff, and hopefully learn a bit more about the markup in the
      process.</p>

    <p>Obviously, this slows down the committing process, since your submitted
      documentation needs to be marked up, which may take an evening or too.
      But it will get committed.</p>

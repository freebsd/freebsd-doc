    <h1>FreeBSD offers many advanced features.</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>No matter what the application, you want your system's resources
	performing at their full potential.  FreeBSD's advanced features
	enable you to do just that.</p>

    <hr align="left" noshade="noshade" width="100%"><font

	4.4BSD.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the latest <b>BSD</b>
	software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at the
	University of California, Berkeley.  The book <i>The Design and
	  Implementation of 4.4BSD Operating System</i>, written by the 4.4BSD
	system architects, thus describes much of FreeBSD's core functionality
	in detail.</p>

      <p>Drawing on the skills and experience of a diverse and world-wide
	group of volunteer developers, the FreeBSD Project has worked to
	extend the feature set of the 4.4BSD operating system in many ways,
	striving constantly to make each new release of the OS more stable,
	faster and containing new functionality driven by user requests.</p>

    <hr align="left" noshade="noshade" width="100%"><font
      color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">FreeBSD provides higher performance,
	greater compatibility with other operating systems and less system
	administration.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's developers attacked some of the more difficult problems in
	operating systems design to give you these advanced features:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>Bounce buffering</b> gets around a limitation in the PC's ISA
	  architecture that limits direct-memory access to the first 16
	  megabytes.

	  <p><i>Result:</i> systems with more than 16 megabytes operate more
	    efficiently with DMA peripherals on the ISA bus.</p></li>

	<li><b>A merged virtual memory and filesystem buffer cache</b>
	  continuously tunes the amount of memory used for programs and the
	  disk cache.<p><i>Result:</i> programs receive both excellent memory
	    management and high performance disk access, and the system
	    administrator is freed from the task of tuning cache sizes.</p></li>
	
	<li><b>Compatibility modules</b> enable programs for other operating
	  systems to run on FreeBSD, including programs for Linux, SCO,
	  NetBSD, and BSDI.
	  
	  <p><i>Result:</i>&nbsp;users will not have to recompile programs
	    already compiled for one of the compatible OS's, and will have
	    access to a greater selection of off-the-shelf software, like the
	    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/FrontPage/">Microsoft FrontPage
	      Server</a> extensions for BSDI or <a
	      href="http://linux.corel.com/linux8/index.htm">WordPerfect</a>
	    for SCO.</p></li>

	<li><b>Dynamically loadable kernel modules</b> allows new filesystem
	  types, networking protocols or binary emulators to be added to the
	  kernel at runtime without having to generate a new kernel image.

	  <p><i>Result:</i> Much time can be saved and 3rd party vendors can
	    deliver complete subsystems as kernel modules without having to
	    distribute source or have lengthy installation procedures.</p></li>

	<li><b>Shared libraries</b> reduce the size of programs, saving disk
	  space and memory. FreeBSD uses an advanced shared library scheme
	  which offers many of the advantages of ELF, and the current version
	  offers ELF compatibility for both Linux and native FreeBSD
	  programs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Naturally, since FreeBSD is an ongoing effort, you can expect newer
	features and higher levels of stability with each release.</p>

    <h2>What experts have to say . . .</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>``FreeBSD has an outline-structured visual configuration editor
	  ... you can enter the configuration of every device the OS supports
	  and can therefore get a successful installation on the first try
	  almost every time. IBM, Microsoft, and others would do well to
	  emulate FreeBSD's approach.''</i></p>

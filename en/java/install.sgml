<p><b>Note:</b> Please note that due to the current Sun licensing policy the resulting binaries
can not be distributed and you are only permitted to use/hack it personally.
Due to the same reasons you have to manually fetch the source code and patchset
for FreeBSD.</p>

<P>If you should have trouble, you can see the <A HREF="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">
FreeBSD Handbook section on &quot;installing applications&quot;</A> for
help.</P>

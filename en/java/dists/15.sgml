<b>April 7, 2006:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the third patchset (patchlevel 3, "Siberian")
for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.5.0 software.  This release should be suitable for
most applications, as most of the changes since the last patchset are
changes which were backported from the binary release source base to
make it JCK compliant.  In addition, Java Web Start now works and a
problem with the zlib library which caused Eclipse to crash has been fixed.
However, use in a production environment is at your own risk, as always.
Information on downloading the patchset can be found at

release as it is now stable on FreeBSD 4.x and has support for
Java Web Start and the Java browser plugin (Mozilla and Firefox).

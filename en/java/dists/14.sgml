<b>December 30, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the sixth patchset (patchlevel 6) for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.4
software.  This release should be suitable for most applications.  The &jdk; it
produces is de facto compliant, but use in a production environment is still at
your own risk.  This patchset is mainly a bugfix release over 1.4.2p5, with the
exception being the change of the default threads library for -CURRENT to be
libkse rather than libc_r.  Information on downloading the patchset can be
found at
<a href="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk14.html">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk14.html</a>.

<b>November 11, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the fifth patchset (patchlevel 5) for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.4
software.  This release updates the &jdk; to version 1.4.2.  Thanks to
a lot of hard work by <a href="mailto:phantom@FreeBSD.org">Alexey Zelkin</a>
this release passes Sun's compatibility tests in all but a mixed IPv4 and
IPv6 environment.  Information on downloading the patchset can be found at

<b>October 10, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the fourth patchset (patchlevel 4) for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.4
software.  The code is now suitable for most applications, although it does
still contain some problems.  Browser plugin support works, GCC 3.3 is
supported and many bugfixes are included.  This patchset is the 
result of a lot of hard work by the BSD Java Porting Team and continued
support from the FreeBSD Foundation.  Information on downloading the patchset
can be found at

<b>March 7, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the third patchset (patchlevel 3) for the &jdk;&nbsp;1.4
software.  The code is now ready for general testing, although not all
features have been implemented (e.g. plugin, NIO).  This patchset is the 
result of a lot of hard work by <a href="mailto:phantom@FreeBSD.org">Alexey 
Zelkin</a>.  Information on downloading the patchset can be found at

software.  Please keep in mind that this patchset is still for experienced
testers and developers.  This patchset is based on &jdk;&nbsp;1.4.1 and is the
result of a lot of hard work by <a href="mailto:phantom@FreeBSD.org">Alexey

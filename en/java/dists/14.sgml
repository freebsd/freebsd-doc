<b>March 7, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the third patchset (patchlevel 3) for the &jdk; 1.4
software.  The code is now ready for general testing, although not all
features have been implemented (e.g. plugin, NIO).  This patchset is the 
result of a lot of hard work by <a href="mailto:phantom@FreeBSD.org">Alexey 
Zelkin</a>.  Information on downloading the patchset can be found at

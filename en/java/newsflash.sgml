<br>
<p>This was posted to announce@FreeBSD.org:</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation has secured a license from Sun Microsystems to
distribute a native FreeBSD version of both the Java Development Kit (&jdk;)
and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Thanks to the great efforts of
the FreeBSD Java team, these should be available for inclusion with the
upcoming release of FreeBSD 4.5 in January, 2002.</p>

<p>
The general availability of a distributable version of Java will
benefit end users, commercial users, and developers who use FreeBSD.
Java continues to grow in popularity and has become heavily used in
server side web applications, one of FreeBSD's core areas of strength.
With an officially licensed binary Java distribution, FreeBSD becomes
an ideal platform for execution, development, and deployment of Java
based solutions.</p>

<p>
This agreement would not have been possible without the efforts of
<a href="mailto:nate@FreeBSD.org">Nate Williams</a>. Nate not only
started the FreeBSD Java porting effort, but also brought Sun Microsystems
and the Foundation together to negotiate a license.</p>

<p>

<br><a href="mailto:sobomax@FreeBSD.org">Maxim Sobolev</a> has created a
port of the Sun's <a href="http://www.sun.com/forte/ffj/index.html">Forte[tm]
for Java[tm]</a>, release 3.0 Community Edition integrated development
environment (IDE).  It can now be built from the ports directory
ports/java/forte.

<p>The port can be used either with native &jdk;&nbsp;1.3.1, or with Linux
&jdk;&nbsp;1.3.1.</p></li>

<h2>August, 2001</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>August 27, 2001:</b>
<br><a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg Lewis</a> has released a
long-awaited port of the &jdk;&nbsp;1.3.1 software.  It can now be built from the
ports directory ports/java/jdk13.  See <a href="dists/13.html">JDK 1.3.x</a>

<h2>September, 2000</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>September 15, 2000:</b> From the Java news desk:
<br><a href="mailto:sean@stat.duke.edu">Sean O'Connell</a> and
<a href="mailto:gallatin@cs.duke.edu">Andrew Gallatin</a> have created
patches to enable FreeBSD to run IBM's &jdk;&nbsp;1.3.
<br><a href="mailto:ernst@jollem.com">Ernst de Haan</a> has been able to
get Sun's Linux &jdk;&nbsp;1.3.0b9 running on 4.0-STABLE. 
<p>Full details on both can be found <a href="dists/13.html">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>August, 2000</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>August 10, 2000:</b> On August 7th, 2000, the FreeBSD &jdk; team 
was given access to Sun's JCK (Java Compatibility Kit), 
which will allow us to test and (hopefully!)
release a binary version using the current set of patches.
Unfortunately, we are unable (for legal reasons) to distribute a &jdk;
that hasn't been run against the JCK like we were able to with the
&jdk;&nbsp;1.1.* releases.

<p>Unfortunately, as told by Sun (we have no experience *yet*), running the
JCK against the port is a difficult and time-consuming process.
Hopefully it won't take us the 3 months that Sun expects it to take. :(</p>

<p>Finally, there are still some issues regarding Motif&reg; that need to be
resolved before a full public release can be made.  Sun is working on
that front, and we need to try contacting the OpenGroup to see if we can
get a special exception for Motif binary distributions to use in the &jdk;
release.</p></li>

<li><b>May 3, 2000:</b> Native &jdk;&nbsp;1.2.2 port enters alpha test phase
<br>Greg Lewis has just announced that the native FreeBSD &jdk;&nbsp;1.2.2 port
has entered alpha test stage.
<br>In its current form, the port will build and run on most FreeBSD releases
(3.4, 4.0 and 5.0 on x86) and work is being done on the others (2.2.8 on x86
and 4.0 alpha).  Most demo applets and applications run.
<br>Currently we are looking for enthusiasts who are willing to spend a
little time testing the new port.  While this is not a trivial task, there are
 clear step-by-step instructions on how to build and use the port.
<br>The patches may be found, as usual on:
<br><a href="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk.html">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk.html</a>

<br>Greg Lewis releases the pre-alpha patches for enterprising
Java users to build their own native FreeBSD &jdk;&nbsp;1.2.2 from. This
process is not for the faint of heart, and the resulting &jdk; is not for

For FreeBSD versions 3.* and 4.* which use the ELF binary format. Note, due to a
 number of changes in -CURRENT, the &jdk; may not work properly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>October, 1999</h2><ul>

<li><b>October 11, 1999:</b> Work has re-started on the Java2/&jdk;&nbsp;1.2 port. 
Expect an early 'alpha' release in the coming weeks for FreeBSD
3.3-stable/ELF boxes.</li></ul>

<h2>September, 1999</h2><ul>
<li><b>September 22, 1999:</b> Re-rolled the &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.8 yet again to fixup
some minor bugs that people have found, as well as to speedup the &jdk;. 
For details checkout the README.FreeBSD supplied in the releases.
<ul>
<li>jdk1.1.8_AOUT.V99-9-22.tar.gz.

</ul>

<h2>July, 1999</h2><ul>
<li><b>July 19, 1999:</b> Re-rolled the &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.8 release to fix a couple of
minor (but annoying bugs).  First, the netpatch (see below) was
incorporated into the build, and second an annoying Floating Point bug
was found and fixed.  The latter bug affected multi-threaded code that
did floating point calculations and based on the code could produce
completely bogus results.
<ul>
<li>jdk1.1.8_AOUT.V99-7-19.tar.gz.
For FreeBSD versions 2.2.*, which use the A.OUT binary format.</li>

</ul>

<h2>June, 1999</h2><ul>
<li><b>June 8, 1999:</b> A small bug was found in the &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.8 release which
affected people using UDP sockets.  If you tried to send a packet to the
broadcast address, the FreeBSD &jdk; refused with a permissions error.
This error was fixed, and rather than re-releasing the entire release a
small patchset was re-rolled for those folks who are experiencing this
problem.  If you experience this problem, feel free to download the
gzipped tarfile and untar it wherever you installed the jdk.  It will
install itself over top of the old version.  If you aren't experiencing
the bug, there is no need to apply the patch, although it wouldn't hurt.

For FreeBSD versions 3.* and 4.* which use the ELF binary format.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>June 3, 1999:</b> &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.8 for A.OUT and ELF releases.  This release
adds support for older 3.*/ELF releases (without requiring any runtime
loader changes), as well as fixes bugs in LOCALE and timezone support
for all FreeBSD releases.
<ul>

</ul></li>

<li><b>June 1, 1999:</b>  JDK2 status
<ul>
<li>
Work on &jdk;&nbsp;1.2/JDK2 has been going very slow as the development team has
been focusing it's effort on solid JDK1 releases.  For most JDK2 development
issues, you can use the JDK1 release and the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html#download-swing">Swing</a>
releases provided by Sun for JDK1, which works very well under FreeBSD.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>April, 1999</h2><ul>
<li><b>Apr. 16, 1999:</b> New &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.7 A.OUT release.  This fixes build
problems in the March release.  A new ELF release will be made to
support older 3.0 releases as well sometime in the near future.
<ul>
<li>jdk1.1.7_AOUT.V99-4-16.tar.gz.
For FreeBSD versions 2.2.*, which use the A.OUT binary format.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>March, 1999</h2><ul>
<li><b>Mar. 26, 1999:</b> ELF support for &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.7, as well as a new A.OUT
release which includes minor bugfixes.
<ul>
<li>jdk1.1.7_AOUT.V99-3-24.tar.gz.
For FreeBSD versions 2.2.*, which use the A.OUT binary format.</li>
<li>jdk1.1.7_ELF.V99-3-25.tar.gz.
For FreeBSD versions 3.x and 4 which use the ELF binary format.  <b>Note</b>:
This requires changes made to the runtime loader to support dladdr()
functionality made on 1999/3/24.  You will need to be running 3.1-stable 
or 4.0-current dated later than 1999/3/24.  If you don't have the new loader
binary or are not tracking -stable or -current, you can download it 
from <a href="ld-elf.so.1">here</a> and install it as 
/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1 (you need to be root to do this):

<pre># install -c -s -o bin -g bin -m 555 -C -fschg <b>ld-elf.so.1</b> /usr/libexec</pre></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Mar. 16, 1999:</b> Updates on current development:
<ul>
<li>
ELF &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.7 :  An ELF build of &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.7 (for use on FreeBSD 3.x and later)
is currently entering it's initial internal testing phase.  A beta 
release should be available in a few weeks.</li>
<li>
JDK2 (aka &jdk;&nbsp;1.2): Several individuals are working on porting JDK2 to
FreeBSD, but the work is progressing slowly.  This is primarily due to a
lack of developer time to work on this project.  (The release of
Blackdown's JDK2 port will assist our development when they release
their source diffs.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>December, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>Dec. 21, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.7.V98-12-21.tar.gz.
<ul>
<li>
Bugfix version of &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.7.  Thanks go to Keith White who tracked down a
couple annoying (and serious) bugs in the &jdk;, notably the modulo bug.  This
release also has the 256 file-descriptor limit bumped up to 2048.  The JRE
should also be much more usable, again thanks to Keith.</li>

<h2>November, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>Nov. 14, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.7.V98-11-5.tar.gz.

<h2>September, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>Sept 23, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.6.V98-9-23.tar.gz.
<ul>
<li>
The August 14 build had jre incorrectly linked in both the &jdk; and the JRE,
so a new release was rebuilt with the correct linkage.  Otherwise, there were
no changes from the older release.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>August, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>Aug 22, 1998:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Updated page to list numerous sites who have agreed to mirror the &jdk;

<li><b>Aug 14, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.6.V98-8-14.tar.gz.
<ul>
<li>
The SO_REUSEADDR option is now correctly set on ServerSockets (may affect
other sockets as well.)</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>July, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>July 21, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.6.V98-7-21.tar.gz.

Updated port to &jdk;&nbsp;1.1.6.  Thanks go to
Keith White <a href="mailto:kwhite@site.uottawa.ca">kwhite@site.uottawa.ca</a>
who did most of the work to make this release happen!</li>
<li>
More standard 'naming' for java.version and such.</li>
<li>
Fixes for UDP/Multicast sockets.</li>
<li>
The signal abort error may be fixed (knock on wood).</li>
<li>
Add support for the "KOI8-R" and "CP866" encodings.</li>
<li>
Timezone's now work correctly under FreeBSD (this required some native
code, but it is embedded in the &jdk; so shouldn't affect users.  However,
FreeBSD has one of the few (only?) VM's that correctly support Timezones
now).</li>
<li>
sysRmdir() now correctly removes directories.</li>
<li>
Link in the xpg4 library to support CJK locales.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>May, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>May 5, 1998:</b>
<ul>
<li>

Shop) working under FreeBSD.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>February, 1998</h2><ul><li>
<b>February 25, 1998:</b> jdk1.1.5.V98-2-25.tar.gz.
<ul>
<li>
&jdk;'s built on 2.2.2 should now work again.</li>
<li>
The AWT now correctly sets the Window name.</li>
<li>
Fixed obscure bug that could cause a core dump if you hit a button in a
dialog box multiple times.</li>
<li>
Fixed bug where SHMEM wasn't released when using images, causing a leak.</li>
</ul>

<b>February 12, 1998:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Johan Larsson graciously provided an ftp mirror site
for the &jdk;, so if you have an aversion to using HTTP, then feel free to
grab it from his site.</li>
<li>
Replaced the 'Steaming Cup of Java' logo with the 'Jump to Java' logo,

<li><b>May 3, 2000:</b> Native JDK 1.2.2 port enters alpha test phase
<br>Greg Lewis has just announced that the native FreeBSD JDK 1.2.2 port
has entered alpha test stage.
<br>In its current form, the port will build and run on most FreeBSD releases
(3.4, 4.0 and 5.0 on x86) and work is being done on the others (2.2.8 on x86
and 4.0 alpha).  Most demo applets and applications run.
<br>Currently we are looking for enthusiasts who are willing to spend a
little time testing the new port.  While this is not a trivial task, there are
 clear step-by-step insturctions on how to build and use the port.
<br>The patches may be found, as usual on:
<br><a href=
"http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-latest.tar.gz">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-latest.tar.gz</a>

<li><b>March 22, 2000:</b> Pre-Alpha JDK 1.2.2 patches availible.
<BR>Greg Lewis releases the pre-alpha patches for enterprising
Java users to build their own native FreeBSD JDK&nbsp;1.2.2 from. This
process is not for the faint of heart, and the resulting JDK is not for
production systems. Having said that, most AWT and Swing demo's have been
found to run. There is plenty of work to do, and we need all the testers we
can find. Patches and build instructions may be downloaded from

<BR>The Linux Blackdown Port Team has released RC4 of JDK 1.2.  It has 
been tested on FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE and later and runs all demo applets
and jfc demos.  Several people have mentioned some problems running it with 
Apache JServ.  Until it can be added to the FreeBSD port tree, it can be found

did floating point calculations and based on the code could produce

<LI><B>June 8, 1999:</B> A small bug was found in the JDK1.1.8 release which
affected people using UDP sockets.  If you tried to send a packet to the
broadcast address, the FreeBSD JDK refused with a permissions error.
This error was fixed, and rather than re-releasing the entire release a
small patchset was re-rolled for those folks who are experiencing this
problem.  If you experience this problem, feel free to download the
gzipped tarfile and untar it wherever you installed the jdk.  It will
install itself over top of the old version.  If you aren't experiencing
the bug, there is no need to apply the patch, although it wouldn't hurt.

ELF JDK1.1.7 :  An ELF build of JDK1.1.7 (for use on FreeBSD 3.x and later)

release should be availible in a few weeks.
<LI>
JDK2 (aka JDK1.2): Several individuals are working on porting JDK2 to
FreeBSD, but the work is progressing slowly.  This is primarily due to a
lack of developer time to work on this project.  (The release of
Blackdown's JDK2 port will assist our development when they release
their source diffs.)

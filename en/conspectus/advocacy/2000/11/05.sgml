    <h3><a name="1"></a>Nov 01 - 03 (21 posts): <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=3453+0+archive/2000/freebsd-advocacy/20001105.freebsd-advocacy">About introducing newbies to FreeBSD</a></h3>
    
    <p>Quoting a lengthy post to freebsd-questions regarding the usability
      of /stand/sysintall for newbies, <a href="mailto:mj@isy.liu.se">[Micke
      Josefsson]</a> asked for comments and suggestions from the list about
      a new user interface for a regular install.</p>

    <p>Some notable thoughts were:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I think there should be some info available in sysinstall
	(or whatever replaces it) explaining what is happening in each
	step, and the relevant terms...The terms I speak of here are the
	FreeBSDish terms (as opposed to generic UNIX terms like users
	&amp; groups) that every rookie asks about - slice?  distribution?
	port?  package?  The context of each step is not
	explained.</i> - <a href="mailto:sjt@cisco.com">[Steve
	Tremblett]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Since most of our new users come to us from either Windows
	or Linux, we need an installation program that is a lot more like
	the ones that they've used in the past.  I've often wondered how
	many users we lose while they are trying to load the OS.  What I
	would really like to see is a FreeBSD installer on par with the
	UnixWare 7 or Tru64 5.0 installers (a clone of SCO Admin would be
	nice too!).  Failing that, we probably need something that looks
	more like a Linux installer, or a really good rosetta stone.</i>
	- <a href="mailto:bob@inu.net">[Bob Martin]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>To get back on track, one of sysinstalls failings, while not
	being a technical point, is it's image.  Everytime I talk to some
	llama who's installing linux, he goes "OOOOOOhhhhh look at all the
	pretty colors, mmmmmmmmmmm graphical install...does FreeBSD have
	that???"  Of course me being the civilized being that I am, instead
	of smacking them upside the head then and there, I wait till they
	are finished installing, and laugh my arse off linuxconf shits
	itself for the 20th time...So in conclusion, in order to make
	FreeBSD's initial installation easier for the
	novice/unix beginner/grandma, yes, sysinstall does need an
	overhaul.</i> - <a href="mailto:wyldephyre2@yahoo.com">[Haikal
	Saadh]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>What is absolutely maddening is the way the installer accepts
	input from the users. Sometimes you press (or are supposed to
	press) &lt;RETURN&gt; and some other times you are supposed to
	press &lt;SPACE&gt;.  But the worst part is when you just finished
	installing the OS and you find yourself back in a menu telling you
	to do some final adjustments. If you decide to do these final
	adjustments, the f*****ng  installer installs the OS again!
	It´s outrageous!</i> - <a href="mailto:ignacioc@avantel.net">[Ignacio
	Cristerna]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Obviously, we all agree &ndash; we need some sort of new and/or
      seperate "first boot install" for newbies coming to us from Windows,
      Linux, etc... and according to <a
      href="mailto:jkh@winston.osd.bsdi.com">[Jordan Hubbard]</a>, this
      discussion has been going on for a long, long, long time...</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I'm not just being snide here, we really have had this very
	same discussion (and in almost the same words) on and off for the
	last 7 years now.  It's hardly rocket science to envision an
	installer which has one big button on it which even your
	grandmother could push, the question always boiling down to "Who
	the heck is going to write this thing then?""</i></p>

      <p><i>That's generally where the discussion stops.  Every man and
	his dog can describe an installer which follows in the footsteps
	of Windows, Solaris or even OS X now that we have its installer to
	look at since imitation is a pretty straight-forward design
	challenge.  As I first said back in 1993, "who will step up to the
	plate and create this alternative installer so that we can evaluate
	its merits and possibly even make it the default?"  I'm still
	waiting for an answer to that question, 7 years later. :-)"</i></p>

    <p><a href="mailto:jkh@winston.osd.bsdi.com">[Jordan Hubbard]</a> is
      asking for graphically talented geeks out there to work up a banner
      ad for rotation on various sites including <a
      href="http://www.daemonnews.org">D&aelig;monNews</a>.  Image size
      should be 468x60 pixels, and no larger than 20k.  This is to promote
      the FreeBSD project, so open up the Gimp or whatever your fancy is,
      and email Jordan with what you come up with.  Remember, you're not
      going to get paid for this, the warm fuzzy feeling you get for
      working on the FreeBSD project is enough :-)</p>

    <h3><a name="3"></a>Nov 02 - 05 (10 posts): <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=77785+0+archive/2000/freebsd-advocacy/20001105.freebsd-advocacy">CounterStrike</a></h3>

    <p>This thread started out with <a
      href="mailto:mbendiks@eunet.no">[Marius Bendiksen]</a> urging us to
      push for a CounterStrike (a HalfLife mod) server port.  The first step
      would be to start out with a port skeleton for the dedicated Linux
      server, then the push would begin with Sierra Games for a full
      port. <a href="mailto:dchance@valuedata.net">[Daryl Chance]</a>
      replied with a 'make search key=halflife', stating that the server
      was indeed already ported.  Marius still thinks the game should be
      ported itself though...</p>

    <p>A sub-discussion about using Open Sound System vs. FreeBSD's built-in
      sound support for popular games ensued, and <a href="mailto:">[Terry
      Lambert]</a> tells us:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Most games require a specific sound card API.  This API is
	supported natively in Linux, but FreeBSD does not support this
	API.  To use this API, you must have third party (OSS) sound card
	drivers, or modify FreeBSD's API.  When you suggest this to the
	sound driver people, they tend to get belligerant and talk about
	how their API is better than the Linux API."</i></p>

      <p><i>The OSS drivers are not free, they cost money, but you can use
	them in evaluation mode for 30 days at a pop, so if you want to
	play a game and not pay for the drivers, you have to reinstall them
	every 30 days (I personnaly call this "paying for the drivers in
	the most expensive way possible").</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To which <a href="des@ofug.org">[Dag-Erling Smorgrav]</a> replied:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Bollocks.  It implements the OSS API, or at least tries to.
	If something doesn't work, submit a PR or, even better, patches,
	instead of just bitching and spreading disinformation.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="mailto:jkh@winston.osd.bsdi.com">[Jordan]</a> and <a
      href="mailto:jameso@elwood.net">[Jim]</a> assure us that both Loki
      games in the ports tree play audio just fine with the stock audio
      driver, requiring no changes to the game or your system.</p>

    <p>Here we have Terry Lambert and Jordan Hubbard discussing the previous
      thread about the FreeBSD Installation software.  We'll skip the lengthy
      discussion between these two, but basically, the conversation boils down
      to this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I am merely pointing out that it has been much longer than a
	year without a new installer, and had their terms been agreed to
	a year ago, FreeBSD would have its installer source code today, and
	under the terms you are insisting upon, up front.</i></p>

      <p><i>So now it's your turn to "put up or shut up"; I _can't_ expend
	the effort on these things without a guarantee that that effort will
	not be wasted, like it was last time I spent the effort on these
	and similar projects on behalf of FreeBSD. I _can't_ afford to"</i>
	- <a href="mailto:tlambert@primenet.com">[Terry Lambert]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>And this is speculation masquerading as fact.  You have no
	sure way of knowing that this would, in fact, have occurred or
	that "two FreeBSDs" would have even been widely accepted by the
	project contributors or the user community.  I see it as far more
	likely that your mysterious commercial benefactors would have been
	deluged with demands that they open source their product
	immediately so that people could customize it and this might in
	turn have led to a siege mentality on their part and very poor
	results.  You simply have no way of knowing for sure what you claim
	as fact above.</i></p>

      <p><i>Like I've told you many times, Terry, nobody gets a "guarantee"
	of anything in this project since it's not a kitchen appliance
	dealership which hands out limited customer guarantees along with
	every frigidair they sell.  What you get is the chance to deal with
	a large group of people and try, through dint of effort and
	perserverance, to sell them on your ideas and (more importantly)
	your working code.  Even if I wanted to change this as part of
	"putting up or shutting up" for you I could not since it's not in
	my power to beam hypno-rays directly into the brains of several
	hundred people and get them all to agree up front to buy a used
	car from you.  That's something that you, and only you, can do.
	Same deal *everyone* else gets.  In short, this is life, deal with
	it.</i> - <a href="mailto:jkh@winston.osd.bsdi.com">[Jordan
	Hubbard]</a></p>

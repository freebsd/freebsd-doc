    <p>On May 31, 2000, <a href="mailto:jkh@zippy.cdrom.com">[Jordan
	K. Hubbard]</a> announced to the -stable community a possible

    <p>On the same day, <a href="mailto:jim@thehousleys.net">[James
	Housley]</a> reminded the -stable forum that CTM did not still work as
      it should:</p>
    
    <blockquote>

    <p><a href="mailto:khera@kciLink.com">[Vivek Khera]</a>,
      replying to Jordan's letter, remarked:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I was just investigating the NIS server on 3.4-STABLE, and noticed

      <p><i>Can we get this security updgrade included in the next

    <p>On June 1, 2000, <a href="mailto:grog@lemis.com">[Greg Lehey]</a>
       promulgated the following important result:</p>      

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I've just discovered (and fixed) a serious data

	  serious data corruption can result:</i></p>

      <p><i>1.  You are using RAID-4 or RAID-5 plexes.<br>
	  2.  One of these plexes (not the first plex in the system,

	  3.  You correct these errors with the 'rebuildparity'
	  command.</i></p>
      
      <p><i>Under these circumstances, the corrected blocks will probably be
	  written to the wrong subdisk.  The original parity errors

      <p><i>The fix is in 4-STABLE and 5-CURRENT (revisions 1.22.2.1

    <p><a href="mailto:bharat@sinia.com">[Bharat Mediratta]</a> met
        with some difficulties while trying to upgrade from 3.4-S
        to 4.0-R. The cause turned out to be "bad 144".</p>
    
    <p>He was told that bad 144 tables were no longer supported
       under 4.0 - as is well-known - and that there were no tools to
       deal with them on his updated machine. After searching the 'Net,
       Bharat, thanks to <a href="mailto:dbabler@Rigel.orionsys.com">[David
	Babler]</a>'s indications, came to the following conclusions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>When I installed FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE on my machine there was no 
          indication that bad144 (bad sector forwarding) was not a good
          idea. Support for bad144 went away in 4.0, so if you are using
          it in 3.4  this will get in the way of upgrading.  After you
          reinstall the kernel and reboot it will not let you remounte
          your root partition and will give you an error message like
          this:</i></p>

    <pre>wd0: bad sector table not supported
wd0s1: bad sector table not supported</pre>

      <p><i>So here are some common questions and answers:</i></p>

      <p>Q: How do I tell if my drive has bad144 on it, BEFORE I
	try to upgrade to FreeBSD 4.0 and have it fail on me?</p>

      <p>A: Use the disklabel utility.  'disklabel -r wd0' (replace
	 wd0 with your drive device) will give you the contents of
	 your disk label.  For example:</p>

      <pre># /dev/rwd0c:
type: ESDI
disk: wd0s1
label: 
flags: badsect		<--- NOTE!
bytes/sector: 512
sectors/track: 63</pre>

       <p>Q: How do I remove bad144?</p>

       <p>A: The easiest way to do this is to use disklabel.  You can
	  dump the current label out to disk and then reload it, or
	  you can just edit it in place with 'disklabel -e -r wd0'.
	  All you have to do is remove 'badsect' from the flags line
	  and you're all set.  This won't affect any of your data.
	  bad144 is probably still taking up some space on your disk	
	  but it is no longer in effect.</p>
    </blockquote>
 
    <p>Bharat has also sent the following PR: <a

    <p><a href="mailto:bharat@sinia.com">[Bharat Meditatta]</a> could
      not upgrade from 3.4-S to 4.0-S because the kernel build had 
      died with an in_cksum.c-related error code 1.</p>

    <p>He was advised to proceed in two steps -- 4.0-R, 4.0-S --
      in order to avoid any potential problems. However, 
      <a href="mailto:imp@village.org">[Warner Losh]</a> pointed out
      that the -STABLE update path (3.4-S --> 4.0-S) would still be
      considered as safe unless there was actual evidence against it.
      Other people as well as Warner had in fact succeeded in
      performing the above-mentioned upgrading operation a few days 
      before -- <a href="mailto:guido@mouse.gvr.org">[Guido van Rooij]</a>
      had done that even from 3.1 albeit this required a suitable (but
      not difficult) sequence of actions. In the end, Warner agreed
      to slightly modify the UPDATING file so that it would contain
      a more reliable method.</p>
    
    <p>As is (should be) well-known, the UPDATING file to be considered
      is the <b>new</b> one downloaded via e.g. cvsup.</p>
    
    <p>Here is Warner's upgrading scheme outlined in his own words:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>make buildworld
&lt;follow directions to build/install a kernel&gt;
cd /usr/src/sys/modules
make install
cd /usr/src/sbin/mknod
make install
&lt;follow rebuild disk /dev entries above&gt;	[1]
reboot</pre>

      <p><i>Rather than the current order, since I know that this 
	  works. It also puts the system in an inconsistant state
	  for a shorter period of time since the modules are
	  installed just after the kernel, rather than before the
	  build of the kernel starts.</i></p>

    <p>The question was asked whether the -jn option could be reliably
      employed to make installworld. It seems that it is not the case.</p>

    <h3><a name="15"></a>May 29 - May 30 (9 posts): <a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=168826+0+archive/2000/freebsd-stable/20000604.freebsd-stable">4.0-stable, OpenSSH v1 & v2</a></h3>

    <p><a href="mailto:kwc@world.std.com">[Kenneth W. Cochran]</a>
      asked whether/when OpennSSH v2 would go into -STABLE, and
      what exactly he should do in order to enable v2 and to turn off
      v1.</p>
    
    <p><a href="mailto:kris@FreeBSD.ORG">[Kris Kennaway]</a> 
      answered that OpenSSH v2 would soon be integrated into -STABLE;
      he also confirmed that the right way to disable OpenSSH v1 is 
      to uncomment the NO_OPENSSH line in /etc/make.conf; finally, he
      stated that the corresponding port would disappear as soon as
      they ceased supporting FreeBSD 3.x in ports.</p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This web page is designed to assist both new and experienced users
in the area of FreeBSD security.  FreeBSD
takes security very seriously and is constantly working
on making the OS as secure as possible.</P>

<P>Here you will find additional information, or links to information,
on how to protect your system against various types of attack,
on whom to contact if you find a security-related bug, and so on.  There is
also a section on the various ways that the systems programmer can
become more security conscious so that he is less likely to
introduce vulnerabilities.</P>

<H2>The FreeBSD Security Officer and the Security Officer Team</H2>

<P>To better coordinate information exchange with others in the security
community, FreeBSD has a focal point for security-related communications:
the FreeBSD Security Officer.</P>

<P>If you need to contact the FreeBSD Project about
a possible security issue, you should therefore <A
HREF="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">send mail to the Security
Officer</A> with a description of what you have found and the type of
vulnerability it represents.</P>

<p>In order that the FreeBSD Project may respond to vulnerability
reports in a timely manner, there are four members of the Security
Officer mail alias: the Security Officer, the Deputy Security Officer,
and two Core Team members.  Therefore, messages sent to the
<a
href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">&lt;security-officer@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>
mail alias are currently delivered to:</p>

<table>

  <td>Security Officer</td>

</table>

<p>The Security Officer is supported by the <a
href="mailto:security-team@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Security Team
&lt;security-team@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>, a small group of committers
vetted by the Security Officer.</p>

<p>Please use the <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/public_key.asc">Security
Officer PGP key</a> to encrypt your messages to the Security Officer
when appropriate.</p>

<a NAME="pol"></a>
<h2>Information handling policies</h2>

<p>As a general policy, the FreeBSD Security Officer favors full
disclosure of vulnerability information after a reasonable delay to
permit safe analysis and correction of a vulnerability, as well as
appropriate testing of the correction, and appropriate coordination
with other affected parties.</p>

<p>The Security Officer <em>will</em> notify one or more of the
<a href="mailto:admins@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Cluster Admins</a> of
vulnerabilities that put the FreeBSD Project's resources under
immediate danger.</p>

<p>The Security Officer may bring additional FreeBSD developers
or outside developers into discussion of a submitted security
vulnerability if their expertise is required to fully understand or
correct the problem.  Appropriate discretion will be exercised to
minimize unnecessary distribution of information about the submitted
vulnerability, and any experts brought in will act in accordance of
Security Officer policies.  In the past, experts have been brought
in based on extensive experience with highly complex components of
the operating system, including FFS, the VM system, and the network
stack.</p>

<p>If a FreeBSD release process is underway, the FreeBSD Release
Engineer may also be notified that a vulnerability exists, and its
severity, so that informed decisions may be made regarding the release
cycle and any serious security bugs present in software associated
with an up-coming release.  If requested, the Security Officer will
not share information regarding the nature of the vulnerability with
the Release Engineer, limiting information flow to existence and
severity.</p>

<p>The FreeBSD Security Officer has close working relationships
with a number of other organizations, including third-party vendors
that share code with FreeBSD (the OpenBSD and NetBSD projects,
Apple, and other vendors deriving software from FreeBSD, as well
as the Linux vendor security list), as well as organizations
that track vulnerabilities and security incidents, such as CERT.
Frequently vulnerabilities may extend beyond the scope of the
FreeBSD implementation, and (perhaps less frequently) may have
broad implications for the global networking community.  Under such
circumstances, the Security Officer may wish to disclose vulnerability
information to these other organizations: if you do not wish the
Security Officer to do this, please indicate so explicitly in any
submissions.</p>

<p>Submitters should be careful to explicitly document any special
information handling requirements.</p>

<p>If the submitter of a vulnerability is interested in a coordinated
disclosure process with the submitter and/or other vendors, this
should be indicated explicitly in any submissions.  In the absence
of explicit requests, the FreeBSD Security Officer will select a
disclosure schedule that reflects both a desire for timely disclosure
and appropriate testing of any solutions.  Submitters should be aware
that if the vulnerability is being actively discussed in public forums
(such as bugtraq), and actively exploited, the Security Officer may
choose not to follow a proposed disclosure timeline in order to
provide maximum protection for the user community.</p>

<p>Submitters should be aware that the FreeBSD Project is an open
source project, and source revision control information for every
change made to the FreeBSD source tree is publicly accessible.  If a
disclosure schedule is provided, it should take into account both the
official release of advisory, patch, and update information, as well
as initial inclusion of fixes in the FreeBSD source tree.  There is
necessarily a lag between the inclusion of fixes in the tree and the
generation and releases of advisories, patches, and binary updates, as
the source control system is used to generate them.</p>

<p>Submissions may be protected using PGP.  If desired, responses will
also be protected using PGP.</p>

<H2>FreeBSD Security Advisories</H2>

<P>The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for
several branches of FreeBSD development.  These are the <EM>-STABLE
Branches</EM> and the <EM>Security Branches</EM>.  (Advisories are not
issued for the <EM>-CURRENT Branch</EM>.)</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>There is usually only a single -STABLE branch, although
during the transition from one major development line to another
(such as from FreeBSD 4.x to 5.x), there is a time span in which
there are two -STABLE branches.  The -STABLE branch tags have names
like <TT>RELENG_4</TT>.  The corresponding builds have names like
<TT>FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE</TT>.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch.
The Security Branch tags have names like <TT>RELENG_4_6</TT>.
The corresponding builds have names like <TT>FreeBSD
4.6-RELEASE-p7</TT>.</P></LI>

</UL>

<P>Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered
in <A HREF="http://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
document</A>.</P>

<P>Each branch is supported by the Security Officer for a limited time
only, and is designated as one of `<EM>Early adopter</EM>',
`<EM>Normal</EM>', or `<EM>Extended</EM>'.  The designation is used as a
guideline for determining the lifetime of the branch as follows.</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Early adopter</DT>
  <DD>Releases which are published from the -CURRENT branch will be
  supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 6 months after
  the release.</DD>
  <DT>Normal</DT>
  <DD>Releases which are published from the -STABLE branch will be
  supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 12 months after the
  release.</DD>
  <DT>Extended</DT>
  <DD>Selected releases will be supported by the Security Officer for a
  minimum of 24 months after the release.</DD>
</DL>

<P>The current designation and estimated lifetimes of the currently
supported branches are given below.  The <EM>Estimated EoL
(end-of-life)</EM> column gives the earliest date on which that branch
is likely to be dropped.  Please note that these dates may be extended
into the future, but only extenuating circumstances would lead to a
branch's support being dropped earlier than the date listed.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Older releases are not maintained and users are strongly encouraged
to upgrade to one of the supported releases mentioned above.</P>

<P>Like all development efforts, security fixes are first brought into
the <A HREF="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">FreeBSD-current</A> branch.
After a couple of days and some testing, the fix is retrofitted into
the supported FreeBSD-stable branch(es) and an advisory is then sent
out.</P>

<P>Some statistics about advisories released during 2002:</P>
<UL>
<LI>44 advisories of varying severity were issued for the base system.</LI>
<LI>12 advisories described vulnerabilities found only in FreeBSD.
The remaining 32 were problems shared with at least one other OS
(often due to shared code).</LI>
<LI>6 security notices were issued, covering a total of 95 issues in
optional third party applications included in the Ports Collection.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Advisories are sent to the following FreeBSD mailing lists:</P>
<UL>
<LI>FreeBSD-security-notifications@FreeBSD.org</LI>
<LI>FreeBSD-security@FreeBSD.org</LI>
<LI>FreeBSD-announce@FreeBSD.org</LI>
</UL>

<P>Advisories are always signed using the FreeBSD Security Officer
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/public_key.asc"> PGP key
</A> and are archived, along with their associated patches, at our
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/index.html">FTP CERT
repository</A>.  At the time of this writing, the following advisories are
currently available (note that this list may be a few days out of date -
for the very latest advisories please check the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/">FTP site</A>):</P>

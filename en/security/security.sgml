  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This web page is designed to assist both new and experienced
    users in the area of FreeBSD security.  FreeBSD takes security
    very seriously and is constantly working on making the operating
    system as secure as possible.</p>

  <h2>How and where to report a FreeBSD security issue</h2>

  <p>All FreeBSD security issues should be reported to the <a
      href="mailto:secteam@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Security Team</a>
    or, if a higher level of confidentiality is required, PGP encrypted to the <a
      href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">Security Officer Team</a>
    using the <a href="so_public_key.asc">Security Officer PGP key</a>.
    All reports should at least contain:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A description of the vulnerability.</li>
    <li>What versions of FreeBSD seem to be affected if possible.</li>
    <li>Any plausible workaround.</li>
    <li>Example code if possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After this information has been reported the Security Officer or
    a Security Team delegate will get back with you.</p>

  <h3>Spam filters</h3>

  <p>Due to high volume of spam the main security contact mail
    addresses are subject to spam filtering.  If you cannot contact
    the FreeBSD Security Officers or Security Team due to spam filters
    (or suspect your mail has been filtered), please send mail to
    <tt>security-officer-<em>XXXX</em>@FreeBSD.org</tt> with
    <em>XXXX</em> replaced with <tt>3432</tt> instead of the normal
    addresses.  Note that this address will be changed periodically so
    check back here for the latest address.  Mails to this address
    will go to the FreeBSD Security Officer Team.</p>

  <a name=sec></a>
  <h2>The FreeBSD Security Officer Team and the FreeBSD Security Team</h2>

  <p>In order that the FreeBSD Project may respond to vulnerability
    reports in a timely manner, there are three members of the Security
    Officer mail alias: the Security Officer,
    Deputy Security Officer, and one Core Team member.
    Therefore, messages sent to the <a
    href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">&lt;security-officer@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>
    mail alias are currently delivered to:</p>

  <table>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.cperciva; <a
        href="mailto:cperciva@FreeBSD.org">&lt;cperciva@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>Security Officer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.simon; <a
        href="mailto:simon@FreeBSD.org">&lt;simon@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>Deputy Security Officer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>&a.rwatson; <a
        href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">&lt;rwatson@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a></td>
      <td>FreeBSD Core Team liaison, Release Engineering liaison,<br>
          TrustedBSD Project liaison, system security architecture expert</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The Security Officer is supported by the <a
      href="&base;/administration.html#t-secteam" >FreeBSD Security
      Team</a> <a
      href="mailto:secteam@FreeBSD.org">&lt;secteam@FreeBSD.org&gt;</a>,
    a small group of committers vetted by the Security Officer.</p>

  <a name="pol"></a>
  <h2>Information handling policies</h2>

  <p>As a general policy, the FreeBSD Security Officer favors full
    disclosure of vulnerability information after a reasonable delay
    to permit safe analysis and correction of a vulnerability, as well
    as appropriate testing of the correction, and appropriate
    coordination with other affected parties.</p>

  <p>The Security Officer <em>will</em> notify one or more of the
    FreeBSD Cluster Admins of
    vulnerabilities that put the FreeBSD Project's resources under
    immediate danger.</p>

  <p>The Security Officer may bring additional FreeBSD developers or
    outside developers into discussion of a submitted security
    vulnerability if their expertise is required to fully understand
    or correct the problem.  Appropriate discretion will be exercised
    to minimize unnecessary distribution of information about the
    submitted vulnerability, and any experts brought in will act in
    accordance of Security Officer policies.  In the past, experts
    have been brought in based on extensive experience with highly
    complex components of the operating system, including FFS, the VM
    system, and the network stack.</p>

  <p>If a FreeBSD release process is underway, the FreeBSD Release
    Engineer may also be notified that a vulnerability exists, and its
    severity, so that informed decisions may be made regarding the
    release cycle and any serious security bugs present in software
    associated with an up-coming release.  If requested, the Security
    Officer will not share information regarding the nature of the
    vulnerability with the Release Engineer, limiting information flow
    to existence and severity.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer has close working relationships with
    a number of other organizations, including third-party vendors
    that share code with FreeBSD (the OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonFlyBSD
    projects, Apple, and other vendors deriving software from FreeBSD,
    as well as the Linux vendor security list), as well as
    organizations that track vulnerabilities and security incidents,
    such as CERT.  Frequently vulnerabilities may extend beyond the
    scope of the FreeBSD implementation, and (perhaps less frequently)
    may have broad implications for the global networking community.
    Under such circumstances, the Security Officer may wish to
    disclose vulnerability information to these other organizations:
    if you do not wish the Security Officer to do this, please
    indicate so explicitly in any submissions.</p>

  <p>Submitters should be careful to explicitly document any special
    information handling requirements.</p>

  <p>If the submitter of a vulnerability is interested in a
    coordinated disclosure process with the submitter and/or other
    vendors, this should be indicated explicitly in any submissions.
    In the absence of explicit requests, the FreeBSD Security Officer
    will select a disclosure schedule that reflects both a desire for
    timely disclosure and appropriate testing of any solutions.
    Submitters should be aware that if the vulnerability is being
    actively discussed in public forums (such as bugtraq), and
    actively exploited, the Security Officer may choose not to follow
    a proposed disclosure timeline in order to provide maximum
    protection for the user community.</p>

  <p>Submissions may be protected using PGP.  If desired, responses
    will also be protected using PGP.</p>

  <h2>Supported FreeBSD Releases</h2>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for
    several branches of FreeBSD development.  These are the
    <em>-STABLE Branches</em> and the <em>Security Branches</em>.
    (Advisories are not issued for the <em>-CURRENT Branch</em>.)</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p>The -STABLE branch tags have
      names like <tt>RELENG_7</tt>.  The corresponding builds have
      names like <tt>FreeBSD 7.0-STABLE</tt>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch.
      The Security Branch tags have names like <tt>RELENG_7_0</tt>.
      The corresponding builds have names like <tt>FreeBSD
      7.0-RELEASE-p1</tt>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered in <a
      href="http://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
      document</a>.</p>

  <p>Each branch is supported by the Security Officer for a limited
    time only, and is designated as one of `<em>Early adopter</em>',
    `<em>Normal</em>', or `<em>Extended</em>'.  The designation is
    used as a guideline for determining the lifetime of the branch as
    follows.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Early adopter</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from the -CURRENT branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 6 months after
      the release.</dd>
    <dt>Normal</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from a -STABLE branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 12 months after the
      release, and for sufficient additional time (if needed) to ensure
      that there is a newer release for at least 3 months before the
      older Normal release expires.
    </dd>
    <dt>Extended</dt>
    <dd>Selected releases (normally every second release plus the last
      release from each -STABLE branch) will be supported by the
      Security Officer for a minimum of 24 months after the release,
      and for sufficient additional time (if needed) to ensure that
      there is a newer Extended release for at least 3 months before the
      older Extended release expires.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <a name="supported-branches"></a>

  <p>The current designation and estimated lifetimes of the currently
    supported branches are given below.  The <em>Estimated EoL
    (end-of-life)</em> column gives the earliest date on which that
    branch is likely to be dropped.  Please note that these dates may
    be extended into the future, but only extenuating circumstances
    would lead to a branch's support being dropped earlier than the
    date listed.</p>

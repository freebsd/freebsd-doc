<p>These are the specific policies that the Ports Management Team has
  adopted regarding commits to the ports tree.</p>

<h3>Changes to <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt></h3>

<p>portmgr acts as sole committer for <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt> at all times.
Proposed changes must be submitted as PRs and assigned to portmgr.</p>

<h3>Changes when the tree is open</h3>

<p>Open to everything that would not
  <a href="implementation.html#requires_regression_test">require a
  regression test</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes when the tree is frozen</h3>

<p>All changes must be approved by portmgr.  In general, only
  the following will be accepted:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>fixes that would prevent a port from installing or deinstalling
    properly for the <strong>upcoming</strong> release.</p></li>

  <li><p>security problems.  If sufficiently severe, these may imply the
    need to create a slipped tag.</p></li>

  <li><p>licensing issues.  These require a slipped tag.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes when the tree is thawed</h3>

<p>No <a href="implementation.html#sweeping_changes">sweeping changes</a>.
This is to prevent possibly having to rebuild all the release packages.</p>

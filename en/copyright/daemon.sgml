    <p>The little red fellow that graces many of these pages is
      the BSD Daemon.  In the context of Unix systems, daemons
      are process that run in the background attending to various
      tasks without human intervention.  In the general sense,
      daemon is an older form of the word demon.  In the <em>Unix
      System Administration Handbook</em>, Evi Nemeth has this to
      say about daemons:</p>

    <blockquote>"Many people equate the word ``daemon'' with the
      word ``demon,'' implying some kind of Satanic connection
      between UNIX and the underworld.  This is an egregious
      misunderstanding.  ``Daemon'' is actually a much older form
      of ``demon''; daemons have no particular bias towards good
      or evil, but rather serve to help define a person's
      character or personality.  The ancient Greeks' concept of a
      ``personal daemon'' was similar to the modern concept of a
      ``guardian angel'' --- ``eudaemonia'' is the state of being
      helped or protected by a kindly spirit.  As a rule, UNIX
      systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons."
      (p403)
    </blockquote>

    <p>The earliest (and most popular) renditions of the BSD Daemon were
      created by John Lassiter.  More recent FreeBSD-specific
      renditions have done by
      <a href="http://www.mt.cs.keio.ac.jp/person/hosokawa.html">
      Tatsumi Hosokawa</a>, but the basic inspiration was definitely John's.

    <h2>What Are Snapshots?</h2>

    <p>As part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall release process
      <em>before</em> a release actually slips out the door with problems,
      we are now periodically producing interim test releases called
      <em>snapshots</em>.
      These snapshots will be very similar to full releases,
      except that they will be somewhat more minimal.</p>

    <h2>Getting Snapshots</h2>

    <p>The snapshots currently available are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/">Snapshots in July, 2005</a>
	  (<a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/README.TXT">README.TXT</a>)
	<ul>
	  <li>Built at 02 July 2005 07:00 UTC.</li>
	  <li>6-CURRENT only:
	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/6-CURRENT-SNAP20050702-alpha-disc1.iso">alpha</a>,
 	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP005-amd64-disc1.iso">amd64</a>,

	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP005-sparc64-disc1.iso">sparc64</a>.
	  </li>

          <li>Remarkable changes: new DHCP client (dhclient)
	    from OpenBSD, new WPA wireless authentication framework,
	    many VFS bugfixes, significantly improved 32-bit application support on amd64,
	    and significantly improved kernel crashdump support for machines with 4GB or
	    more of RAM, many bug fixes to TCP, NFS, DRI, and other subsystems.</li>

	  <li>For known issues, see
	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jul_2005/README.TXT">README.TXT</a>.</li>
	</ul>

      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/">Snapshots in June, 2005</a>
	  (<a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/README.TXT">README.TXT</a>)
	<ul>
	  <li>Built at 03 June 2005 05:00 UTC.</li>
	  <li>6-CURRENT:
 	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP004-alpha-disc1.iso">alpha</a>,
 	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP004-amd64-disc1.iso">amd64</a>,
	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP004-i386-disc1.iso">i386</a>,

	    <a href="&url.snapshots;/Jun_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP004-sparc64-disc1.iso">sparc64</a>.</li>

          <li>A significant number of VFS bugs have been fixed since
            the March snapshot, but more testing is needed.</li>
	</ul>

      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/">Snapshots in March, 2005</a>
	  (<a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/README.TXT">README.TXT</a>,
	  <a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP002-alpha-disc1.iso">alpha</a>,
	  <a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP002-amd64-disc1.iso">amd64</a>,
	  <a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP002-i386-disc1.iso">i386</a>,

	  <a href="&url.snapshots;/Mar_2005/6.0-CURRENT-SNAP002-sparc64-disc1.iso">sparc64</a>)

	<ul>
	  <li>6-CURRENT only.  Built at 15 March 2005 15:48 UTC.</li>

	  <li>Many VFS locking improvements.</li>

	  <li>New release ISO layout.  Disc1 now combines the installation
	    distributions with the full live filesystem layout.  Packages for
	    official releases will go onto disc2.  This layout will also be
	    used for the FreeBSD 5.4 release.</li>

	  <li>Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) support.</li>

	  <li>Many bug fixes to interrupt routing, busdma, and other subsystems and
	    drivers.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/">Snapshots in February, 2005 (alpha, amd64, i386, ia64, pc98, sparc64)</a></li>
<!-- template for adding a new entry:

      <li><a href="&url.snapshots;/Feb_2005/">Snapshots in February, 2005 (alpha, amd64, i386, ia64, pc98, sparc64)</a>

    <p>Currently the snapshots of
      <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#CURRENT">6-CURRENT</a>
      and <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#STABLE">5-STABLE</a>
      are released monthly in URLs in the format
      <tt>&url.snapshots;/&lt;month&gt;_&lt;year&gt;/</tt>
      where <tt>&lt;year&gt;</tt> is the year,
      <tt>&lt;month&gt;</tt> is the month the snapshot was released.
      Each snapshot directory might contain a <tt>RELNOTES.TXT</tt>
      file which outlines the changes for the particular snapshot.</p>

    <h2>Things You Might Want to Know</h2>

    <p>In particular, before getting and installing a snapshot release,
      be aware of following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The snapshots are primarily for
	testing purpose and not fully tested compared to the releases.
	They may include experimental or degraded features that
	can corrupt your existing system.</li>

      <li>The major release number will not be changed in the
	main distribution for each snapshot.
	It will <em>only</em> be changed on the boot floppies
	so that you know when the snapshot was made.
	These are <em>not</em> releases, these are <em>snapshots</em>,
	and it is important that this distinction be preserved.
	Although people can and will, of course, refer to snapshots
	by date in mail or netnews, do not confuse them.</li>

      <li>Finally, we will not necessarily update the documentation.
	For example, <tt>README</tt> may still refer
	to a previous release.  This is because that is much less important
	than getting the real bug fixes and new features out for testing.
	Please do not send a bug report about the documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your feedback on these snapshots is, of course, greatly welcome.
      They are not just for our benefit - those who are coming to rely
      on FreeBSD for mission critical applications should welcome
      a chance to get at more updated bits in a structured fashion.
      You can also use these snapshots as tangible evidence that your
      feedback is getting incorporated and that you (hopefully) will not have
      any unpleasant surprises in the next release.
      On the other hand, if you do send us hate mail next release
      and it turns out that you never even tried the snapshots,
      well, it cuts both ways!</p>

    <h2>Other Resources</h2>

    <p>Here are some related resources.  Note that they are managed by
      other people than the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team.
      These sites provide FreeBSD snapshots in a form of "live filesystem"
      and bootable ISO images on a daily basis.

      if you have any questions.</p>

    <p>On October 31st 1998 (Halloween) Eric Raymond posted a leaked memo from
      Microsoft.</p>

    <p>This prompted Jordan Hubbard to write the following response. This text

    <blockquote><p>[ caution - this is a bit long.  Lots of points here I've been
	wanting to cover for awhile and now seems as good a time as any.. ]</p>

      <p>OK, so we've all seen this latest bit of Linux leaping about and
	shouting from the rooftops and some of us have even gone "agh!"  and
	run around a bit ourselves, but now that we've all hopefully calmed
	down again I'd like to say a few words about this and the state of
	FreeBSD advocacy in general.</p>

      <p>First off, just to cover the Halloween memo in brief, yes it appears
	to be genuinely from Microsoft and yes, it appears to be genuinely
	full of statements culled from various Linux evangelists who feel no
	pangs at making blatantly false pronouncements like "Linux is the only
	OS experiencing growth" or "Linux is the only contender for the x86
	platform."  These types of statements are pure hooey, of course, and
	FreeBSD is currently doing better than it has at any previous point in
	its history.  Our releases are starting to finally hit their stride,
	it seems (and try to remember back to the days when it was more like:
        "My god!  We did it!  A release!"), and our rate of innovation and
        self- improvement hasn't been higher since the 2.0 days - it's very
        encouraging to see that we can spur ourselves to such heights of
        productivity *without* legal injunctions staring us in the face! :-)</p>

    <p>Second, we have to keep sight of the fact that none of this is
      particularly new or even interesting.  We know that Linux is the
      current poster child of the press and we also know about the press's
      irritating predilection for focusing on one and only one champion
      rather than looking more in depth at the situation.  We can yell and
      scream all we like, but we're not going to change the fact that for
      many journalists investigating "Open Source", Linux is the first and
      possibly only thing they're going to look at.  It simply has the right
      sized hype-bubble surrounding it where we do not.
      We also have to accept the fact that ISVs are going to target their
      products at the much more obvious Linux market and try to strike deals
      with it, going "FreeBSD?  What's that?" when asked about a native
      port.  The same goes for investment, selling shares in Red Hat, Inc.,
      etc.  Money always goes after the visible markets first.</p>

    <p>What you have to ask yourselves, looking at the dynamics of this
      situation as dispassionately as possible, is whether all of this is
      necessarily as bad a thing as some of the gloom-n-doomers would have
      us believe.  Looking at only the superficial indicators, it's easy to
      say that "Linux is winning and we're losing", pointing to the stacks
      of Linux books and magazines in the bookstores, the Clinton
      transcripts where he mentions Linux, the Goodyear blimp circling
      overhead with Linus's smiling face shining from it, etc etc.  It's
      especially easy to say that when you hold Linux and FreeBSD in your
      mind as equivalent products, started at the same time and with the
      same overall development mentality.</p>

    <p>The fact of the matter is that Linux and FreeBSD are NOT equivalent
      products with identical user and developer communities surrounding
      them, however.  We've *always* been lower key about things, preferring
      to quietly focus on the business of steadily turning out quality
      products to only moderate fanfare.  It's no use screaming for teams of
      FreeBSD fan dancers to come out and start singing the praises of
      FreeBSD in full 4-part hyperbole with some grinning, cigar-chomping
      promoter standing in the background - that's just not us.  The
      nay-sayers will also say that "this not being us" will surely be our
      downfall since you gotta sing and dance now if you want to be noticed,
      but I'm really not so sure about that.  To my way of thinking, we have
      our style and we have our niche and they're both respectable in their
      own way.  Not everyone buys toilet paper because a team of singing
      rabbits (to paraphrase the great Rod Serling) suggested it on
      television, and some people DO react positively to the somewhat less
      superficial attributes of quality, consistency and a focus on the
      technology rather than on standing in front of the cameras and saying
      things like "open source validates the concept of a basic human
      sociological tropism towards cooperation and the free and open
      exchange of .." to some vapid blond on Technology Week.</p>

    <p>That kind of approach might also get all the sound bites this week,
      but remember the old "15 minutes of fame" effect and the fact that the
      press is going to get bored with Linux eventually and go off in search
      of other things they don't understand to dissect.  When that
      inevitably happens, it's going to be back to quality and those groups
      who remained true to their basic operating principles and didn't get
      sucked in and destroyed by excessive growth or hype.  The
      opportunities for wandering off and getting lost in the woods in
      pursuit of some bright and shiny object have never been higher than
      they are now, and somebody's bound to panic and go off and do
      something stupid in an effort to differentiate themselves.  I don't
      think we have any need to panic at all and should simply keep doing
      what we're doing and try to do it as best we can.</p>

    <p>I'm not saying that there's no room for improvement, and some
      alliances *are* being made with various artist/marketing types whom we
      think can help us get the attention we deserve, but it's not the same
      as saying that we're going to drop everything and go play Linux's game
      now.  That would be the wrong move and I can only point to the history
      of BSD itself when searching for good examples of technologies which
      have remained viable long after "losing" a war to a competitor.  BSD
      "lost" to SYSV over a decade ago, but did that kill it?  Quite
      apparently not and it appears to be doing better today than it ever
      did even back in its heyday, when it ran on a large collection of
      VAXes but hardly any of the commodity (68K) hardware at all (you had
      to buy an obscure 32016 based machine if you wanted to run BSD at home :-).
      The situation today is vastly improved by comparison and most people
      don't even stop to think about that.</p>

    <p>In any case, I didn't mean this posting as a fluffy "we're fine!"
      sorta thing, though I do think that people sometimes lose sight of our
      own growth rate and notable successes when furrowing their brows over
      the latest Linux PR victory, I do have a summary of points I think we
      can and should improve:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Keep pushing the magazine articles out.  These seem to be easier for
	  people than books and I've largely given up on trying to incite a
	  FreeBSD book to happen - I guess that will just occur in its own
	  good time.  Walnut Creek CDROM is still paying a bounty for magazine
	  articles (matching funds for your fee) and has enabled more than one
	  person to buy a new machine for the price of one weekend's writing
	  for a good cause.  Pick a target publication and go for it, folks!
	  I've done about 3 of these so far (maybe more, I forget :) and can
	  say that it's not that hard.  You generate a simple article outline and
	  you submit it to the editor along with your proposal for what
	  you're trying to accomplish with the article (just a paragraph or
	  two of text, not a thesis).  If they're interested, they'll send you
	  back details on how long they want the article to be (generally
	  500-1000 words) and how much they're willing to pay.  When they
	  pay, send us a photocopy/FAX of your royalty check and we'll pay
	  too.  It's that simple, and it good for FreeBSD to appear in print
	  like this since it reaches outside the somewhat closed audience of
	  the mailing lists.</p></li>
        <li><p>Look at Linux as a door opener, not a threat.  I mean this,
	  folks, even you rabid Linux haters out there.  Consider very
	  carefully the fact that if customer A needs a PC to do server job B,
	  customer A is going to do one of four things:</p>

	<ol>
        <li>Buy NT</li>
        <li>Buy a commercial Unix</li>
        <li>Buy Linux</li>
        <li>Buy *BSD</li>
</ol>
	<p>Those really are about the only 4 options for building a
	  department fileserver or gateway box with cheap, commodity hardware
	  (we'll assume the people who don't want cheap buy Cisco gear, Suns
	  and NetApp filers anyway) and let's look at them in turn:</p>

	<ol>
        <li><p>If they buy NT, you can pretty much write them off.  By the
	      time they realize what they've gotten themselves into, the
	      investment (or embarrassment) is generally too great to back out
	      of anyway and it's actually very few IS shops that seem to claw
	      their way back from NT and install a free OS instead.  Sure, you
	      hear widely trumpeted stories whenever some large ISP does make
	      it back from NT, but its very rareness is what makes it
	      something to trumpet about.  NT is Darth Vader here and we must
	      fear his control of the dark side (marketing) and the fact that
	      "everybody knows NT" when the issue of personnel comes up with
	      most pointy-haired managers.</p></li>
        <li><p>Is a much better option since at least the customer has
	      accepted Unix as their savior and can potentially be won over at
	      some point by OSS, but the fact that they chose a commercial
	      Unix probably also means that they have deep-seated needs for
	      tech support or inter-operability with other parts of the IS
	      shop and you'll probably have to work on them for awhile to win
	      them over.</p></li>
        <li><p>Here now we've at least accomplished two things:  We've got
	      the customer admitting that they want Unix and that they want a
	      free Unix. Furthermore, they've chosen a solution which we think
	      we can beat in all the taste tests if we can just get the CD in
	      front of their faces.  All in all, this has got to be the
	      easiest conversion of the three and a definite win if their only
	      other options were A or B.</p></li>
        <li><p>Yay!  Of course we like this one, but if it's not FreeBSD
	      then we still have a bit of a conversion job to do and it might
	      even require something like a SPARC port to be able to offer the
	      same cross-platform inter-operability that the user has chosen
	      the other *BSD for.  It's something to think about, and
	      certainly no better than the Linux scenario in some ways (again,
	      if you're just thinking about this from the pure, mercenary "how
	      do we get more FreeBSD users" perspective).</p></li>
</ol>
      </li>
        <li><p>Hold your advocacy to a higher standard, and by this I mean that
	  if we're to weather this whole PR blitz period with our reputation
	  for being "the calm and level-headed ones" intact, we can't stoop
	  to the level of some Linux advocates when trying to make short-term
	  gains against their PR blitzes.  Sometimes you just have to be
	  Gandi.</p>

	<p>When the press have gone away, believe me, people will remember
	  which groups stuck to their guns and didn't compromise their
	  identities or ideals and which went sort of nuts and participated
	  in a few raping and pillaging sessions.  I'd far rather be the
	  group still standing there when the smoke clears going "Yup, we're
	  still here and still doing good software without the fanfare or
	  fancy costumes.  Have a look!"</p>

	<p>To put it another way:  If FreeBSD were a respected musical
	  entertainer, I would want her to be the one who stuck to doing
	  the kind of music she liked and always did it well rather than
	  horrifying us during the disco years by suddenly putting on spandex
	  pants and lip-syncing to formulaic, song-factory material or
	  shrieking out heavy-metal lyrics in heavy makeup with Axel Rose 10
	  years later. :-)   Sometimes the price of "success" is too
	  high.</p></li>

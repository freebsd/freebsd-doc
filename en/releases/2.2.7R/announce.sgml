<b>From:</b> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@time.cdrom.com><br>
<b>Subject:</b>FreeBSD 2.2.7 is now released!</p>

<P>It is my usual pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD 2.2.7, our
latest release along the 2.2-stable branch.  Those folks who are still
running 2.1.x and wish to upgrade to 2.2 technology are encouraged to
do so as 2.2.7 has reached a more than equivalent level of stability
in all of our tests.  A number of problems with 2.2.6 have also been
fixed (see the <A HREF="notes.html">release notes</A> for more
information).</P>

<p>FreeBSD 2.2.7-RELEASE is available on <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD">ftp.FreeBSD.org</A> and
various <A HREF="&base;/handbook/mirrors.html">FTP mirror sites</A>
throughout the world.  It can also be ordered on CD from
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</A>, from where it
will be shipping shortly as a 4 CD set containing a lot of extra stuff
of interest to programmers and general users alike.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: All of the profits from the sales of this CD set
go to support the FreeBSD Project!</p>

<p>Like many businesses in the field of high-tech, Walnut Creek CDROM has
realized that in order to make any product for an emerging market
grow, you have to make a significant investment in such growth, even
if it means abandoning short-term profits.  Walnut Creek CDROM is the
only CDROM vendor who currently does anything like this and it's
certainly my hope that you will help support the project by buying (or
getting someone else to buy :) one of their CDs.  Thanks!</p>

<p>The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:</p>

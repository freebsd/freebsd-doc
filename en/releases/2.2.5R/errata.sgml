The file <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.2.5-RELEASE/ERRATA.TXT">
ERRATA.TXT</a> contains post-release ERRATA for 2.2.5 and should always
be considered the definitive place to look <strong>first</strong> before reporting
a problem with this release.  This file will also be periodically
updated as new issues are reported so even if you've checked this
file recently, check it again before filing a bug report.  Any
changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

	freebsd-stable@freebsd.org

For 2.2.5 security advisories, see:

	<a href="ftp://freebsd.org/pub/CERT/">ftp://freebsd.org/pub/CERT/</a>

For the latest information (note the URL carefully - this is NOT
ftp.freebsd.org).

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 2.2.5:	One

o <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-97:05/">FreeBSD-SA-97:05</a> (available from <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT</a>).

  You may also simply remove /dev/io as a quick work-around if you're
  not running an X server or some other specialized utility which
  requires access to the I/O instructions.
 
---- System Update Information:
<strong>o The appletalk stack was broken in 2.2.5.</strong>

Fix:  If you plan to run appletalk, you should apply the following patch:

<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/atalk.diff.2.2.gz">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/atalk.diff.2.2.gz</a>

<strong>
o The line printer spooler lpd will, when sending jobs to remote
  printers, kill the child process sending to the remote after the
  timeout specified in the `ct' capability (2 minutes by default).</strong>

Fix:  Please upgrade the lpd subsystem to 2.2-stable.  As a workaround,
      increase the `ct' capability to an unreasonably large number of
      seconds (like 3600).

<strong>
o Intel "F00F bug" enables users to hang machines with Pentium processors
  if they have access to the machine and can execute programs.</strong>

Fix:  Update to the 2.2-stable version of the kernel or apply the patch
      found in: 
 
      <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/f00f.diff.2.2.gz">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/f00f.diff.2.2.gz</a>

<strong>
o A bug in the ipfw code exists where using the "reset tcp" firewall command
  causes the kernel to write ethernet headers onto random kernel stack
  locations.</strong>

Fix:	Update to the 2.2-stable version of the kernel or apply the
        patch found in <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/ipfw.diff.gz">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/updates/2.2.5-RELEASE/ipfw.diff.gz</a>

<strong>
o A bug in XF86Setup causes it to fail to create a symbolic link from
  /usr/X11R6/bin/X to the right X server for your hardware if a link
  does not already exist.  When you type startx the following error is
  displayed:

  xinit:  No such file or directory (errno 2):  no server "X" found in PATH</strong>
  
Fix:	Execute the following commands (as root) and re-run XF86Setup.

	# cd /usr/X11R6/bin
	# ln -s XF86_VGA16 X
	
	If XF86Setup asks you if you want to use the existing XF86Config for
	defaults choose no.  When it asks you if you want to create an 'X'
	link to the server choose yes.

<strong>
o A bug in the phase diagram implementation of user-level ppp causes
  problems with some ppp implementations when shutting down the link.
  The line will go dead, but the modem will not hang up unless done
  manually using pppctl (or a switch).</strong>

Fix:  A version of ppp derived from the -current sources is available from
      <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/~brian/">http://www.FreeBSD.org/~brian</a>

      It should build on any version of FreeBSD from 2.0.5 onwards.
      This code is available in the -current tree, but not (yet) in the
      2.2-STABLE tree.

<pre>
If you read no other documentation before installing this
version of FreeBSD, you should at least by all means *READ
THE ERRATA* for this release so that you don't stumble over
problems which have already been found and fixed.  This ERRATA.TXT
file is obviously already out of date by definition, but other
copies are kept updated on the net and should be consulted as
the "current errata" for your release.  These other copies of
the errata are located at: 

  1. <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>

  2. ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/&lt;your-release&gt;/ERRATA.TXT   
     (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location).          

Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

	<a href="mailto:freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org</a>

For all FreeBSD security advisories, see:

	<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/">http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/</a>

for the latest security incident information.

---- Security Advisories:

The vulnerability documented in security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:39 was
fixed in FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE.  The release notes mentioned the fix,
but made no mention of the security advisory.

A vulnerability in the fts(3) routines (used by applications for
recursively traversing a filesystem) could allow a program to operate
on files outside the intended directory hierarchy.  This bug, as well
as a fix, is described in security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:40.

---- System Update Information:

The release note entry for the ESS Maestro-3/Allegro sound driver gave
an incorrect command for loading the driver via /boot/loader.conf.
The correct command is:

	snd_maestro3_load="YES"

ssh(1) is no longer SUID root.  The primary manifestation of this
change is that .shosts authentication may not work "out of the box".
Both temporary and permanent fixes are described in the FAQ at:

	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/admin.html#SSH-SHOSTS">http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/admin.html#SSH-SHOSTS</a>

<h3>Testing foci for &local.rel;-RELEASE</h3>

  <tr>
    <td>bce(4) stability fixes</td>
    <td>&status.untested;</td>
    <td>&a.scottl;</td>
    <td>Several stability fixes for bce(4) were merged from HEAD to
      RELENG_6 around 20061024.  Initial testing results have been
      promising, but more testing reports would be useful.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>em(4) stability fixes</td>
    <td>&status.untested;</td>
    <td>&a.scottl;, &a.jfv;, &a.glebius;, &a.kris;</td>
    <td>Several difficult-to-diagnose stability issues have been
      observed in the em(4) driver since August.  As of 20061027, a
      newer driver provided by Intel (version 6.2.9) has been
      committed to RELENG_6 for testing.  If this version of the em(4)
      driver does not perform satisfactorily, it may be necessary to
      revert the driver to its prior state (approximately that of
      6.1-RELEASE).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>sysinstall(8) kernel selection fix</td>
    <td>&status.untested;</td>
    <td>&a.erwin;</td>
    <td>A bug in sysinstall(8) could result in it failing to install a
      kernel on a new disk if the user did not choose a distribution
      from the distribution menu.  This is believed to have been
      fixed as of 20061029, but could use more testing.</td>

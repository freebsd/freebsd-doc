<p>This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, containing significant
information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as
well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
installing this version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This errata document for FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of
FreeBSD 6.3-RELEASE.</p>

<p>This errata document contains &#8220;late-breaking news&#8221; about FreeBSD
6.2-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to
learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and
fixed.</p>

<p>Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for
example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are
kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the &#8220;current errata&#8221;
for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"
target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>, plus any sites which keep up-to-date
mirrors of this location.</p>

<p>Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 6-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this
document (as of the time of the snapshot).</p>

Corrections</a></h2>

<p>[20070116] The release notes should have mentioned that a separate ISO image has been
created with readable documentation files. It contains renderings of the documention for
all supported languages; the last several FreeBSD releases only contained English
documents due to space limitations.</p>

<p>[20070116] Some versions of the release announcement contained an incorrect manual
page reference for the GELI disk encryption subsystem. The correct manual page is <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=geli&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+6.0-stable">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">geli</span>(8)</span></a>.</p>

<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="KNOWN-PROBLEMS" name="KNOWN-PROBLEMS">4 Known Problems and
Solutions</a></h2>

<p>[20070116] As mentioned in the release notes, the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=arcmsr&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+6.0-stable">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">arcmsr</span>(4)</span></a> driver
was updated for FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE. Some isolated crash problems were noted after this
update, although the driver in general tends to work quite well for many testers, and it
seems to be &#8220;better&#8221; in general in terms of functionality and supported
hardware. Users having problems may wish to consider backing out the driver update or
installing a version of this driver <a
href="ftp://ftp.areca.com.tw/RaidCards/AP_Drivers/FreeBSD/DRIVER/SourceCode/"
target="_top">directly from Areca</a>. Further investigation is continuing into these
issues.</p>

<p>[20070116] FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE has been diagnosed with kernel bug related to
UNIX-domain sockets. A <a href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jhb/patches/unp_gc.patch"
target="_top">patch</a> for this problem has been committed to HEAD and RELENG_6, and is
a candidate for an errata patch to RELENG_6_2 after further testing.</p>

<p>[20070116] Systems with very heavy network activity have been observed to have some
problems with the kernel memory allocator. Symptoms are processes that get stuck in
zonelimit state, or system livelocks. One partial workaround for this problem is to add
the following line to <tt class="FILENAME">/boot/loader.conf</tt> and reboot:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
kern.ipc.nmbclusters="0"
</pre>

<p>Other workarounds have been discussed on the <tt class="LITERAL">freebsd-current@</tt>
and <tt class="LITERAL">freebsd-stable@</tt> mailing lists.</p>

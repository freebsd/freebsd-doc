  <b>From:</b> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@zippy.osd.bsdi.com&gt;<br>
  <b>To:</b> announce@FreeBSD.org<br>
  <b>Subject:</b> 4.1.1-RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org</p>


<p>As always, I'm pleased to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 4.1.1-RELEASE, a point release update for 4.1-RELEASE
and, of course, the very latest in 4.x-STABLE branch technology.</p>

<p>Since 4.1-RELEASE was produced in August 2000, RSA released their
code into the public domain and a number of other security
enhancements were made possible through the FreeBSD project's
permission to export cryptographic code from the United States.
These changes are fully reflected in 4.1.1-RELEASE, making it
one of the most secure "out of the box" releases of FreeBSD
we've ever done.</p>

<p>We also took the opportunity to include support for new features
like IDE ATA100 support, drivers for additional Gigabit ethernet
cards and hardware watchpoints in gdb.  Please see the release notes
for more information.</p>

<p>The 4.1.1-RELEASE is available right now for the
<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE">i386</a>
architecture
(alpha to follow in several days) in "FTP installable" and ISO image
form.  For the appropriate bits, please see:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE/">
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE/</a><br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso">
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso
</a></p>

<p>When the Alpha release follows in several days, it will be available from:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.1.1-RELEASE/">
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.1.1-RELEASE/</a><br>

</a></p>

<p>Please watch the <a href="mailto:alpha@FreeBSD.org">alpha@freebsd.org</a> mailing list for an announcement.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This is a network only point release and will not be
made generally available for sale on CDROM, at least not from BSDi or
anyone else we currently have knowledge of.  The next official CD release
will be FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, still scheduled for mid-November 2000.</p>

<p>FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the
following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Russia,
Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Elbonia, the
Ukraine and the United Kingdom (and quite possibly several others
which I've never even heard of :).</p>

<p>Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional
mirror(s) first by going to:</p>

<pre>
  ftp://ftp.&lt;yourdomain&gt;.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD
</pre>
  
<p>Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.</p>

Thanks!

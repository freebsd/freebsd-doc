  <b>From:</b> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@zippy.osd.bsdi.com&gt;<br>
  <b>To:</b> announce@FreeBSD.org<br>
  <b>Subject:</b> 4.1-RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org</p>

<p>I'm very pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 4.1-RELEASE,
the very latest in 4.x-STABLE branch technology.  Following the
release of FreeBSD 4.0 in March, 2000, many bugs were fixed, important
security issues dealt with, and quite a few new features added.
Please see the release notes for more information.</p>

<p>The 4.1-RELEASE is available for
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1-RELEASE">i386</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.1-RELEASE">alpha</a>
right now and can be installed directly over the net using the boot floppies
or copied to a local NFS/ftp server.  ISO images will also be provided
later (see below).</p>

ISO (CD) Images<br>
---------------<br>
<p>ISO images of the installation CD will be made available by August 1st
2000, after the bits have undergone a bit more integration testing.
This additional delay is necessary given that the ISO images are so
large (~650MB each) and are not something which many people want to
transfer more than once.  A follow-up announcement will be sent once
the ISO images are in place, so please don't send me email asking
where they are or when they'll be ready.  When they're ready, they'll
be uploaded and an announcement will be sent out.</p>

<p>We also can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry these large
ISO images, but they will at least be available from:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1-install.iso">
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1-install.iso</a><br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.1-install.iso">
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.1-install.iso</a></p>

<p>If you can't afford the CDs, are impatient, or just want to use it for
evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISOs, otherwise please
do continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing one of its
official CD releases from BSDi.  FreeBSD 4.1-RELEASE can be ordered as a
4 CD set from <a href="http://www.freebsdmall.com">The FreeBSD Mall</a>
from where it will soon be shipping.  Each CD sets contains the FreeBSD
installation and application package bits for either the x86 or the
alpha architecture (each architecture has its own CD set).  For a set of
distfiles used to build ports in the ports collection, please see also the
FreeBSD Toolkit, a 6 CD set containing all such extra bits which we can no
longer fit on the 4 CD sets.  You can also order by phone, postal mail,
FAX or email at:</p>

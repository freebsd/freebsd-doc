<p>FreeBSD 2.1.7 is now available in:</p>

<blockquote>

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.7-RELEASE

</blockquote>

<p>And shortly from its various mirror sites, a list of which may be
obtained from:  <a href="&base/handbook/mirrors.html">http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/mirrors.html</a></p>

<p>This is a security release to FreeBSD 2.1.6, fixing at least several
security holes and addressing a number of outstanding problem reports
in that release.</p>

<p>FreeBSD 2.1.7 will also be available on CDROM from <a
href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</a>, hopefully shipping
within the next 3-4 weeks.  If you are a customer of Walnut Creek
CDROM and you purchased the 2.1.6 release (either by subscription or
by retail) then you are also entitled to a <b>free upgrade</b>.  All
you need to do is send mail to <a
href="mailto:orders@cdrom.com">orders@cdrom.com</a> or call 1-800
786-9907 / +1 510 674-0783 Intl, indicate that you would like the free
2.1.7 upgrade and provide your name and address information so that a
replacement can be shipped.  Walnut Creek CDROM customers will also
receive a letter explaining these details.

<p>Those puzzled by the near-simultaneous release of 2.1.7 and 2.2
should also look at http://www.freebsd.org/branch.html for
the reasons behind this release schedule.  CDROM subscription
customers should see this page for information on Walnut Creek CDROM's
plans for these releases.</p>

<p>If you are a commercial user of FreeBSD who would like to take
advantage of recent bug fixes without making the jump to our more
ambitious 2.2 release (or delay that jump until 2.2 has had more time
to mature), or if you're simply looking for the lowest-impact upgrade
from 2.1.5, then 2.1.7-RELEASE is for you.</p>

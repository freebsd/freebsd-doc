<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="SECURITY" name="SECURITY">2 Security Advisories</a></h2>

<p>(30 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) A bug in <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mksnap_ffs&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mksnap_ffs</span>(8)</span></a>
causes the creation of a filesystem snapshot to reset the flags on the filesystem to
their default values. The possible consequences depend on local usage, but can include
disabling extended access control lists or enabling the use of setuid executables stored
on an untrusted filesystem. This bug also affects the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dump&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">dump</span>(8)</span></a> <var
class="OPTION">-L</var> option, which uses <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mksnap_ffs&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mksnap_ffs</span>(8)</span></a>.
Note that <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mksnap_ffs&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mksnap_ffs</span>(8)</span></a> is
normally only available to the superuser and members of the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">operator</tt> group. This bug has been fixed on the FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE
security fix branch and in FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE. For more information, see security
advisory <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:01.mksnap_ffs.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:01</a>.</p>

<p>(8 Feb 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
(specifically the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shmat&amp;sektion=2&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">shmat</span>(2)</span></a> system
call) can cause a shared memory segment to reference unallocated kernel memory. In turn,
this can permit a local attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information, bypass of access control
mechanisms, or privilege escalation. This bug has been fixed on the FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE
security fix branch and in FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE. More details, including bugfix and
workaround information, can be found in security advisory <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</a>.</p>

<p>(28 Feb 2004) It is possible, under some circumstances, for a processor with superuser
privileges inside a <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">jail</span>(8)</span></a>
environment to change its root directory to a different jail, giving it read and write
access to the files and directories within. This vulnerability has been closed on the
FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE security fix branch and in FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE. Information on the
bug fix can be found in security advisory <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:03.jail.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:03</a>.</p>

<p>(4 Mar 2004) It is possible for a remote attacker to conduct a low-bandwidth
denial-of-service attack against a machine providing TCP-based services, filling up the
target's memory buffers and potentially leading to a system crash. This vulnerability has
been addressed on the FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE security fix branch, but is present in both
FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE and 5.2.1-RELEASE. Security advisory <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</a> contains more details, as well as information on
patching existing systems.</p>

<p>(17 Mar 2004) By performing a specially crafted SSL/TLS handshake with
an application that uses OpenSSL a null pointer may be dereferenced.  This
may in turn cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service
attack.  For more information see the Security Advisory
<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</a> which contains more details and instructions
on how to patch existing systems.</p>

<p>(29 Mar 2004) A local attacker may take advantage of a programming error in the
handling of certain IPv6 socket options in the
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setsockopt&amp;sektion=2&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setsockopt</span>(2)</span></a> system call
to read portions of kernel memory without proper authorization.  This may result in disclosure of
sensitive data, or potentially cause a panic.  See Security Advisory
<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:06.ipv6.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:06</a> for a more detailed description and instructions on
how to patch existing systems.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="OPEN-ISSUES" name="OPEN-ISSUES">3 Open Issues</a></h2>

<p>(9 Jan 2004) Due to a change in <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cpp&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">cpp</span>(1)</span></a> behavior,
the login screen for <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=xdm&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=XFree86+4.3.0">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">xdm</span>(1)</span></a> is in
black and white, even on systems with color displays. As a workaround, update to a newer
version of the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/x11/XFree86-4-clients/pkg-descr"><tt
class="FILENAME">x11/XFree86-4-clients</tt></a> port/package.</p>

<p>(9 Jan 2004) There remain some residual problems with ACPI. In some cases, systems may
behave erratically, or hang at boot time. As a workaround, disable ACPI, using the ``safe
mode'' option of the bootloader or using the <var
class="VARNAME">hint.acpi.0.disabled</var> kernel environment variable. These problems
are being investigated. For problems that have not already been reported (check the
mailing list archives <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">before</i></span>
posting), sending the output of <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=acpidump&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">acpidump</span>(8)</span></a> to
the <a href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a> may help diagnose the problem.</p>

<p>(9 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) In some cases, ATA devices may behave erratically,
particularly SATA devices. Reported symptoms include command timeouts or missing
interrupts. These problems appear to be timing-dependent, making them rather difficult to
isolate. Workarounds include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn off ATA DMA using the ``safe mode'' option of the bootloader or the <var
class="VARNAME">hw.ata.ata_dma</var> sysctl variable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use the host's BIOS setup options to put the ATA controller in its ``legacy mode'', if
available.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Disable ACPI, for example using the ``safe mode'' option of the bootloader or using
the <var class="VARNAME">hint.acpi.0.disabled</var> kernel environment variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these problems were addressed in FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE with the import of a
newer <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ata&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ata</span>(4)</span></a> from
5.2-CURRENT.</p>

<p>(9 Jan 2004) Installing over NFS when using the install floppies requires that the <tt
class="FILENAME">nfsclient.ko</tt> module be manually loaded from the third floppy disk.
This can be done by following the prompts when <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">sysinstall</span>(8)</span></a>
launches to load a driver off of the third floppy disk.</p>

<p>(9 Jan 2004) The use of multiple vchans (virtual audio channels with dynamic mixing in
software) in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pcm&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">pcm</span>(4)</span></a> driver
has been known to cause some instability.</p>

<p>(10 Jan 2004) Although APIC interrupt routing seems to work correctly on many systems,
on some others (such as some laptops) it can cause various errors, such as <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ata&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ata</span>(4)</span></a> errors or
hangs when starting or exiting X11. For these situations, it may be advisable to disable
APIC routing, using the ``safe mode'' of the bootloader or the <var
class="VARNAME">hint.apic.0.disabled</var> loader tunable. Note that disabling APIC is
not compatible with SMP systems.</p>

<p>(10 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The NFSv4 client may panic when attempting an NFSv4
operation against an NFSv3/NFSv2-only server. This problem has been fixed with revision
1.4 of <tt class="FILENAME">src/sys/rpc/rpcclnt.c</tt> in FreeBSD 5.2-CURRENT. It was
also fixed in FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE.</p>

<p>(11 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) Some problems have been encountered when using
third-party NSS modules, such as <tt class="FILENAME">nss_ldap</tt>, and groups with
large membership lists. These have been fixed with revision 1.2 of <tt
class="FILENAME">src/include/nss.h</tt> and revision 1.2 of <tt
class="FILENAME">src/lib/libc/net/nss_compat.c</tt> in FreeBSD 5.2-CURRENT; this fix was
backported to FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE.</p>

<p>(13 Jan 2004) The FreeBSD 5.2-CURRENT release notes incorrectly stated that <b
class="APPLICATION">GCC</b> was a post-release GCC 3.3.3 snapshot. They should have
stated that GCC was a <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">pre-release</i></span>
GCC 3.3.3 snapshot.</p>

<p>(13 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/sysutils/kdeadmin3/pkg-descr"><tt
class="FILENAME">sysutils/kdeadmin3</tt></a> port/package has a bug in the <b
class="APPLICATION">KUser</b> component that can cause deletion of the <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> user from the system password file. Users are strongly urged
to upgrade to version 3.1.4_1 of this port/package. The package set included with FreeBSD
5.2.1-RELEASE contains the fixed version of this package.</p>

<p>(21 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) Some bugs in the IPsec implementation imported from
the KAME Project can result in memory objects being freed before all references to them
were removed. Reported symptoms include erratic behavior or kernel panics after flushing
the Security Policy Database (SPD). Some of these problems have been fixed in FreeBSD
5.2-CURRENT in rev. 1.31 of <tt class="FILENAME">src/sys/netinet6/ipsec.c</tt>, rev.
1.136 of <tt class="FILENAME">src/sys/netinet/in_pcb.c</tt>, and revs. 1.63 and 1.64 of
<tt class="FILENAME">src/sys/netkey/key.c</tt>. These bugfixes were backported to FreeBSD
5.2.1-RELEASE. More information about these problems has been posted to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a>, in particular the thread entitled <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2004-January/thread.html#18084"
target="_top">``[PATCH] IPSec fixes''</a>.</p>

<p>(28 Feb 2004) The edition of the Porters Handbook included with FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE
contained an incorrect value for 5.2.1-RELEASE's <var
class="VARNAME">__FreeBSD_version</var>. The correct value is <var
class="LITERAL">502010</var>.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT1">
<hr />
<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="LATE-NEWS" name="LATE-NEWS">4 Late-Breaking News</a></h2>

<p>(10 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The TCP implementation in FreeBSD now includes
protection against a certain class of TCP MSS resource exhaustion attacks, in the form of
limits on the size and rate of TCP segments. The first limit sets the minimum allowed
maximum TCP segment size, and is controlled by the <var
class="VARNAME">net.inet.tcp.minmss</var> sysctl variable (the default value is <var
class="LITERAL">216</var> bytes). The second limit is set by the <var
class="VARNAME">net.inet.tcp.minmssoverload</var> variable, and controls the maximum rate
of connections whose average segment size is less than <var
class="VARNAME">net.inet.tcp.minmss</var>. Connections exceeding this packet rate are
reset and dropped. Because this feature was added late in the 5.2-RELEASE release cycle,
connection rate limiting is disabled by default, but can be enabled manually by assigning
a non-zero value to <var class="VARNAME">net.inet.tcp.minmssoverload</var>. This feature
was added to FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE too late for inclusion in its release notes.</p>

<h2>The Machine</h2>

	<img src="gifs/powerlogo.gif" alt="" align="right"> <p>The machine, 
	<tt>www.freebsd.org</tt>, otherwise known as 
	<tt>freefall.cdrom.com</tt>, is 200MHz Pentium Pro machine with a PCI 
	motherboard, 128 megabytes of RAM and 12 gigabytes of disk space.  	
	Naturally, the system runs under the FreeBSD operating system.  Our 
	network connection is generously provided by 
	<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</a>, and the 
	hardware was donated by various 
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/donors.html">supporters</a> 
	of the FreeBSD project. </p>

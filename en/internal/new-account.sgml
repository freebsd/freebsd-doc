  <h2>Authorizing A New Account</h2>

  <p>Someone from the list below sends a PGP-signed email to
    admins@FreeBSD.org, the person assigned as the mentor to the new
    committer, and copied to core@FreeBSD.org confirming the approval of
    the new account.  This email should include a link to this document
    so the mentor/mentee know what is expected of them.</p>

  <p>New account approvals are only valid from these PGP entities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>core-secretary</p></li>
    <li><p>portmgr</p></li>
    <li><p>doceng</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>NOTE:  New account requests from anyone other than these
    entities or requests signed with PGP keys other than from these
    entities will not be acted upon.  No exceptions.</i></p>

  <h2>Information Needed From New Committer</h2>

  <p>The person assigned as the new committers' mentor needs to collect
    and send the following information to admins@FreeBSD.org:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><tt>master.passwd</tt> line containing preferred username,
      shell, and GECOS info (no password is needed)</p></li>
    <li><p>ssh V2 public key (<strong>version 2 ONLY</strong>)</p></li>
    <li><p>PGP key for new committer (used for account recovery or other
      needs that require positive identification of the
      committer)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>admins@FreeBSD.org Creates New Account</h2>

  <p>admins@FreeBSD.org creates the new account with the above
    information on the FreeBSD.org cluster and notifies the mentor and
    the new committer.</p>

  <h2>Mentor Activates New Committer's Commit Bit</h2>

  <p>After the new committer confirms that their account works, the mentor
    activates the new committer's commit bit and guides them through the
    rest of the initial process.</p>

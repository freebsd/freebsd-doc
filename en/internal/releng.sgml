<p>This page documents the process used by the release engineering
  team to produce official FreeBSD releases.  Comments, suggestions,
  and additional material are welcome.  This is, as always, a work in
  progress.</p>

<h1>Release Process</h1>

  <p>New releases of FreeBSD are released from the -STABLE branch at
    approximately four month intervals.  The FreeBSD release process
    begins to ramp up 45 days before the anticipated release date when
    the release engineer sends an email to the development mailing
    lists to remind developers that they only have 15 days to
    integrate new changes before the code freeze.  During this time,
    many developers perform what have become known as ``MFC sweeps''.
    MFC stands for ``Merge From CURRENT'' and it describes the process
    of merging a tested change from our -CURRENT development branch to
    our -STABLE branch.</p>

  Diagram"></center>

  <p>To service our most conservative users, individual release
    branches were introduced with FreeBSD 4.3.  These release branches
    are created shortly before a final release is made, and after the
    release goes out only the most critical security fixes are merged
    onto the release branch.  In addition to source updates via CVS,
    binary patchkits are available to keep systems on the
    <tt>RELENG_4_3</tt> and <tt>RELENG_4_4</tt> branches updated.</p>

  <h2>Code Review</h2>

  <p>Thirty days before the anticipated release, the source repository
    enters a ``code slush''.  During this time, all commits to the
    -STABLE branch must be approved by the release engineer (<a
    href="mailto:re@FreeBSD.org">re@FreeBSD.org</a>).  The kinds of
    changes that are allowed during this 15 day period include :</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bug-fixes.</li>
    <li>Documentation updates.</li>
    <li>Security-related fixes of any kind.</li>
    <li><em>Minor</em> changes to device drivers, such as adding new
      device IDs.</li>

    <li>Any additional change that the release engineering team feels
      is justified given the potential risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After the first 15 days of the code slush, a release candidate is
    released for widespread testing and the code enters a ``code
    freeze'' where it becomes much harder to justify new changes to
    the system unless a serious bug-fix or security issue is involved.
    During the code freeze, at least one release candidate is released
    per week until the final release is ready.  During the days
    leading up to the final release, the release engineering team is
    in constant communication with the security-officer team, the
    documentation maintainers, and the ports managers, to make sure
    that all of the different components required for a successful
    release are available.</p>

  <h2>Final Release Checklist</h2>

  <p>When several release candidates have been made available for
    widespread testing and all major issues have been resolved, the
    final release ``polishing'' can begin.</p>

  <h3>Creating the Release Branch</h3>

  <p>As described in the introduction, the <tt>RELENG_X_Y</tt> release
    branch is a relatively new addition to our release engineering
    methodology.  The first step in creating this branch is to ensure
    that you are working with the newest version of the
    <tt>RELENG_X</tt> sources that you want to branch
    <em>from</em>.</p>

  <tt>/usr/src# cvs up -rRELENG_4 -P -d</tt>

  <p>The next step is to create a branch point tag.  A ``tag'' is CVS
    vernacular for a label that identifies the source at a specific
    point in time.  By tagging the tree, we ensure that future release
    builders will always be able to use the same source we used to
    create the official FreeBSD Project releases.  The branch point
    tag makes it easier to produce diffs against the start of the
    branch :</p>

  <tt>/usr/src# cvs rtag -rRELENG_4 RELENG_4_4_BP src</tt>

  <p>And then a new branch tag is created with :</p>

  <tt>/usr/src# cvs rtag -b -rRELENG_4_4_BP RELENG_4_4 src</tt>

  <p>Note: The <tt>RELENG_*</tt> tags are restricted for use by the
    CVS-meisters and release engineers.</p>

  <a name="versionbump"></a>
  <h3>Bumping up the Version Number</h3>

  <p>Before the final release can be tagged, built, and released, the
    following files need to be modified to reflect the correct version
    of FreeBSD :</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>src/sys/conf/newvers.sh</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/sys/sys/param.h</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/release/doc/share/examples/Makefile.relnotesng</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/release/doc/share/sgml/release.ent</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/release/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/share/sgml/release.dsl</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local</tt></li>
    <li><tt>doc/share/sgml/freebsd.ent</tt></li>
    <li><tt>doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors/chapter.sgml</tt></li>
    <li><tt>www/en/releases/*</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/UPDATING</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The release notes and errata files also need to be adjusted for
    the new release (on the release branch) and truncated
    appropriately (on the stable/current branch):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>src/release/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/relnotes/common/new.sgml</tt></li>
    <li><tt>src/release/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/errata/article.sgml</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Creating the Release Tags</h3>

  <p>When the final release is ready, the following command will create the
    <tt>RELENG_4_4_0_RELEASE</tt> tag.</p>

  <tt>/usr/src# cvs rtag -rRELENG_4_4 RELENG_4_4_0_RELEASE src</tt>

  <p>The Documentation and Ports managers are responsible for tagging
    the respective trees with the <tt>RELEASE_4_4_0</tt> tag.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a last minute fix may be required <em>after</em>
    the final tags have been created.  In practice this isn't a
    problem, since CVS allows tags to be manipulated with <tt>cvs tag
    -d <em>tagname</em> <em>filename</em></tt>.  It is very important
    that any last minute changes be tagged appropriately as part of
    the release.  FreeBSD releases must always be reproduceable.
    Local hacks in the release engineer's environment are not
    acceptable.</p>

<h1>Release Building</h1>

  <p>FreeBSD releases can be built by anyone with a fast machine and
    access to a source repository.  <em>(That should be everyone,
    since we offer anonymous CVS!  See <a
    href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook">The Handbook</a> for
    details.)</em>.  The only special requirement is that the
    <tt>vn</tt> <em>(On -CURRENT, this device has been replaced by the
    new <tt>md</tt> memory disk driver.)</em> device must be
    available.  If the device is not loaded into your kernel, then the
    kernel module should be automatically loaded when
    <tt>vnconfig</tt> is executed during the boot media creation
    phase.  All of the tools necessary to build a release are
    available from the CVS repository in <tt>src/release</tt>.  These
    tools aim to provide a consistent way to build FreeBSD releases.
    A complete release can actually be built with only a single
    command, including the creation of ISO images suitable for burning
    to CDROM, installation floppies, and an FTP install directory.
    This command is aptly named ``make release''.</p>

  <h2>``make release''</h2>

  <p>To successfully build a release, you must first populate
    <tt>/usr/obj</tt> by running ``make world'' or simply ``make
    buildworld''.  The release target requires several variables be
    set properly to build a release :</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><tt>CHROOTDIR</tt></strong> - The directory to be used
      as the chroot environment for the entire release build.</li>
    <li><strong><tt>BUILDNAME</tt></strong> - The name of the release
      to be built.</li>
    <li><strong><tt>CVSROOT</tt></strong> - The location of a CVS
      repository.</li>
    <li><strong><tt>RELEASETAG</tt></strong> - The CVS tag
      corresponding to the release you would like to build.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are many other variables available to customize the release
    build.  Most of these variables are documented at the top of
    <tt>src/release/Makefile</tt>.  The exact command used to build
    the official FreeBSD 4.4 (x86) release was :</p>

  <tt>make release CHROOTDIR=/local3/release BUILDNAME=4.4-RELEASE CVSROOT=/host/cvs/usr/home/ncvs RELEASETAG=RELENG_4_4_0_RELEASE</tt>

  <p>The release Makefile can be broken down into several distinct
  steps.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creation of a sanitized system environment in a separate
      directory hierarchy with ``make installworld''.</li>
    <li>Checkout from CVS of a clean version of the system source,
      documentation, and ports into the release build hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Population of <tt>/etc</tt> and <tt>/dev</tt> in the chrooted
      environment.</li>
    <li>chroot into the release build hierarchy, to make it harder for
      the outside environment to taint this build.</li>
    <li>``make world'' in the chrooted environment.</li>
    <li>Build of Kerberos-related binaries.</li>
    <li>Build 'GENERIC' kernel.</li>
    <li>Creation of a staging directory tree where the binary
      distributions will be built and packaged.</li>
    <li>Build and installation of the documentation toolchain needed
      to convert the documentation source (SGML) into HTML, and text
      documents that will accompany the release.</li>
    <li>Build and installation of the actual documentation (user
      manuals, tutorials, release notes, hardware compatibility lists,
      etc...)</li>
    <li>Build of the ``crunched'' binaries used for installation
      floppies.</li>
    <li>Package up distribution tarballs of the binaries and
      sources.</li>
    <li>Create the boot media and a fixit floppy.</li>
    <li>Create FTP installation hierarchy.</li>
    <li>(optionally) Create ISO images for CDROM/DVD media.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contributed Software (``ports'')</h2>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports">FreeBSD Ports
    collection</a> is a collection of over 6,000 third-party software
    packages available for FreeBSD.  The ports team (<a
    href="mailto:portmgr@FreeBSD.org">portmgr@FreeBSD.org</a>)
    responsible for maintaining a consistent ports tree that can be
    used to create the binary packages that accompany a given FreeBSD
    release.</p>

  <h3>The Ports Cluster</h3>

  <p>In order to provide a consistent set of third-party packages for
    FreeBSD releases, every port is built in a separate chroot
    environment, starting with an empty <tt>/usr/local</tt> and
    <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>.  The requisite dependencies are installed as
    packages before the build proceeds.  This enforces <em>
    consistency</em> in the package build process.  By starting the
    package build in a pristine environment, we can assure that the
    package metadata (such as required dependencies) is accurate, and
    so we will never generate packages that might work on some systems
    and not on others depending on what software was previously
    installed.</p>

  <p>The ``Ports Cluster'' for the x86 architecture currently consists
    of a master node (Dual Pentium III 733Mhz) and 8 slave nodes
    (Pentium III 800Mhz) to do the actual package builds.  With this
    configuration, a complete package build takes over 24 hours.
    These machines are co-located with the other FreeBSD Project
    equipment at Yahoo's corner of Exodus in Santa Clara, CA.</p>

  <p>The ``Ports Cluster'' for the Alpha architecture consists of 7
    PWS 500A machines donated by Compaq and also co-located with
    Yahoo's facilities.</p>

  <h3>The Package Split</h3>

  <p>For FreeBSD 4.4 over 4.1 gigabytes of packages were created.
    This causes a problem for CDROM distributions because we would
    like to ship as many packages as possible without making the user
    insert another disc to satisfy dependencies.  The solution is to
    create ``clusters'' of like packages with similar dependencies
    onto specific discs.  The package split is performed by the <a
    href="mailto:portmgr@FreeBSD.org">portmgr</a> team in coordination
    with the wishes of the general user community with respect to
    which packages get to appear on the first CD.</p>

  <h2>Release ISOs</h2>

  <p>Starting with FreeBSD 4.4, the FreeBSD Project decided to release
    all four ISO images that were previously sold on the BSDi/Wind
    River Systems ``official'' CDROM distributions.  Each of the four
    discs must contain a <tt>README.TXT</tt> file that explains the
    contents of the disc, a <tt>CDROM.INF</tt> file that provides
    meta-data for the disc so that sysinstall can validate and use the
    contents, and a <tt>filename.txt</tt> file that provides a
    manifest for the disc.  This manifest can be created with a simple
    command :</p>

  <tt>/stage/cdrom#  find . -type f | sed -e 's/\^.\///' | sort > filename.txt</tt>

  <p>The specific requirements of each CD is outlined below.</p>

  <h3>Disc #1</h3>

  <p>The first disc is almost completely created by ``make release''.
    The only changes that should be made to the <tt>disc1</tt>
    directory are the addition of a 'tools' directory, XFree86, and as
    many popular third party software packages as will fit on the
    disc.  The 'tools' directory contains software that allow users to
    create installation floppies from other operating systems.  This
    disc should be made bootable so that users of modern PCs do not
    need to create installation floppy disks.</p>

  <p>If an alternate version of XFree86 is to be provided, then
    sysinstall must be updated to reflect the new location and
    installation instructions.  The relevant code is contained in
    <tt>src/release/sysinstall</tt> on -STABLE or
    <tt>src/usr.sbin/sysinstall</tt> on -CURRENT.  Specifically, the
    files <tt>dist.c</tt>, <tt>menus.c</tt>, and <tt>config.c</tt>
    will need to be updated.</p>

  <h3>Disc #2</h3>

  <p>The second disc is also largely created by ``make release''.
    This disc contains a ``live filesystem'' that can be used from
    sysinstall to troubleshoot a FreeBSD installation.  This disc
    should be bootable and should also contain a compressed copy of
    the CVS repository in the <tt>CVSROOT</tt> directory and
    commercial software demos in the <tt>commerce</tt> directory.</p>

  <h3>Discs #3 and 4</h3>

  <p>The remaining two discs contains additional software packages for
    FreeBSD.  The packages should be clustered so that a package and
    all of its dependencies are included on the same disc.</p>

      The stuffed daemon plushies are now shipping from
      <a href="mailto:LiebscherCo@t-online.de">Liebscher & Partner</a>.
      Please contact the company via email for more details.  A picture

      has been released. The new features of this snapshot are:<p></p>
        <ul>
	  <li>A considerable number of changes to the VM system have been made
	  to increase the stability under certain types of load.  If you
	  had panics under the last snapshot, try this one and see if they
	  persist.</li>

	  <li>The AHC driver now does considerably more in the way of handling
	  error conditions gracefully.</li>

	  <li>More cosmetic work on the installation, /stand/sysinstall now
	  genuinely useful after installation time (though still missing a man
	  page - urk!).</li>

	  <li>Basically, lots-o-fixes.  If you are trying to use the 2.2 SNAPs
	  in more serious applications, please upgrade to this version.</li>

	  [Note:  This release will not be made available on CDROM to 2.2-SNAP

      has been released. The new features of this snapshot are:<p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Early support for APM (automated power management) and PCCARD
          (formerly PCMCIA) features of laptops.  Many PCCARD devices
          are supported, from modems to Ethernet cards to SCSI adaptors.</li>

          <li>Adaptec AIC7850 support has been added.</li>

          <li>The Yellow Pages (NIS) support has had many optimizations made
          and no longer has portions copyright under the GPL.</li>

          <li>Various VM system enhancements and a few bugs fixed (gzip'd
          binaries now work again, for example).</li>

          <li>The system installation tool has been revamped with slightly
          different menu behavior and a number of bugs have been fixed.
          It is hoped that this installation will be more intuitive for new
          users than previous ones (feedback welcomed, of course).</li>

          <li>Much miscellaneous cleanup work with the header files and sources.

	  <li>The ARNET (now Digiboard) Sync 570i high-speed serial card is
	  now supported.</li>

	  <li>The Linux emulation is now good enough to run the Linux version
	  of Netscape, with JAVA support (as well as a number of other Linux
	  utilities).</li>

	  <li>The Matrox Meteor frame grabber card is better supported.</li>

	  <li>It is now possible to burn CDROMs using the Plasmon or HP 4080i
	  CDR drives (see `wormcontrol(1)').</li>

	  <li>The pipe code has been substantially sped up, as have some
	  components of the VM system.</li>

	  <li>A /dev/random device (and associated "pool of entropy") has
	  been added for applications which require more unpredictable
	  sequences of random numbers for security.  See the random(4)
	  man page for more info.</li>

	  <li>Early NFS v3 support (not enabled by default).</li>

	  <li>An early implementation of the Device Filesystem (devfs)
	  is available (see mount_devfs).  Device switch tables are now
	  also dynamically built.</li>

	  <li>Early IPX routing support.</li>

    <h2>November 1995</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>19-Nov-1995</b><br>FreeBSD 2.1 is now available at
	ftp sites all around the world.  See the <a
	href="releases/index.html">Release information</a> for
	details.<p></p></li>

      <li><b>4-Nov-1995</b><br><a
	href="releases/snapshots.html">Snapshot</a> 2.1.0-951104 is now
	available.  The purpose of this snapshot is:<p></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>To incorporate changes based on all the feedback
	    and bug reports received for the previous
	    snapshot's installation.</li>

	  <li>To incorporate the latest XFree86 release (3.1.2-S)
	    with security enhancements.  There may be more fairly
	    minor changes here before 2.1 is put on CD, but this
	    is basically what will be shipping.</li>

	  <li>To get feedback on the new ``Novice Install'' split
	    out of the Express installation (which now truly <em>is</em>
	    an express installation).</li>

	  <li>To give folks something a little less buggy to load on new
	  systems while they are waiting for 2.1 to come out.</li>

	  <li>To fold in the latest versions of the FreeBSD
	    Handbook, updated for 2.1.</li>
	    
	  <li>To correct some slight whiffy English in the online help.</li>

	  <li>To go back to the previous approach of just
	    uncommenting the ATAPI and wcd0 entries in GENERIC
	    for building atapi.flp.  The idea of commenting out
	    the wd2 and wd3 entries in an effort to make things
	    better seems to have only made them worse in the last
	    SNAP.  If this atapi.flp image works for you, great!
	    If not, I am afraid that it is far too late to do
	    anything about at this stage so any failure reports
	    will be simply filed for post-2.1 analysis.  Sorry
	    IDE CDROM hackers, but you had your chance!</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>October 1995</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><b>30-Oct-1995</b><br> The 2.1.0-951026 <a
	  href="releases/snapshots.html">Snapshot</a> has been
	re-released with several bug fixes:<p></p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Atapi boot floppy now assumes it is alone by itself
	    on the second IDE controller - this seems to work a
	    lot better for most folks who were provided with
	    dedicated controllers when they purchased their IDE
	    CDROMS.  People with IDE disks on multiple IDE
	    controllers should NOT use this floppy image.  Stick
	    with boot.flp and build a custom kernel or something.</li>

	  <li>The apache WEB server installation makes fewer assumptions about
	    where you will be putting things.</li>

	  <li>Installing the secure dist no longer requires that you also
	    install Kerberos in order to get things like telnet to work.</li>

	  <li>Boot floppy should now support the Adaptec 2940 ULTRA (this was
	    a side-effect more than a bug fix).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>However, there are some outstanding bugs you should know
	about:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>sysinstall seems to croak in certain situations
	    if you run it after the system is installed.</li>

	  <li>The FTP retry code still is not 100% there -
	    apparently it now does not handle reselection very
	    well.  Sigh.  I am so truly sick of looking at that
	    part of the code that if somebody else wanted to have
	    a look, I would not fight them off!  It seems like
	    every time I fix one thing, I break something else.</li>

	  <li>The media selection screen protects itself from
	    re-entry in some situations when you would really like it
	    to be allowed.  Whoops!</li>
	  <li>Using more than one FreeBSD ``slice'' can cause problems.</li>
	</ul>
      <p></p></li>

      <li><b>26-Oct-1995</b><br><a
	href="releases/snapshots.html">Snapshot</a>
	2.1.0-951026 is now available.  New fixes/features
	include:<p></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>All /etc/sysconfig information now written correctly.</li>

	  <li>WEB server option now works properly.</li>

	  <li>The package installation menu now works.</li>

	  <li>All the auto-installation instrumentation
	    (installation by config file) now works.  It is
	    possible to install everything from start to finish
	    on a new system in a fully-automated fashion (if you
	    install a lot of systems, this is a big help).</li>

	  <li>You may now read the HTML Handbook and FAQ
	    documents directly from the boot floppy after
	    installation (as well as visit any other WEB site).</li>

	  <li>Failure to create a /usr is no longer an error,
	    just a warning.</li>

	  <li>The matcd driver was shrunk down some more,
	    <em>possibly</em> resulting in a return to 4MB
	    operation (please test this).</li>

	  <li>The latest ATAPI CDROM changes were merged in and
	    another atapi.flp boot image generated.  Again,
	    please test.</li>

	<ul>
	  <li>SLIP installation did not ``ifconfig sl0''
	    properly.</li>

	  <li>It was not possible to do certain operations
	    atomically, e.g.  just write out fdisk information,
	    or just extract distributions.  This can now be done
	    from the <b>Custom Install</b> menu.</li>

	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>As always, this snapshot is offered as a complete

	  <a href="mailto:freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.ORG">freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.ORG</a>.
	  I will also be getting involved in the whole update

	<ul>
	  <li>Even more bugs fixed.</li>
	  <li>Driver for Matsushita CDROM ("Sound blaster" CDROM) in second
	  revision - it now supports audio commands.</li>
	  <li>Driver for Adaptec 294x improved.</li>
	  <li>FDDI network interface support (DEC cards) improved.</li>
	  <li>Support for DEC 100Mbit "FAST" Ethernet cards (DE 500-XA).</li>
	  <li>/etc files revamped fairly significantly - most customization
	    done through one file now, /etc/sysconfig.</li>
	  <li>Performance improvements to networking code (connection
	  information now hashed rather than being stored in a linear linked

	  <li>The hostname still is not being set properly in

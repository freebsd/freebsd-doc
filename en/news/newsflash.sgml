	all you need to do is register at the site.  These accounts aren't
	for playing, the goal of the program is to make brand new systems
	available to developers so they can test, build and port their
	apps to the world's fastest computer.  The testdrive program also
	offers other systems running FreeBSD, including a Proliant 5500
	dual Xeon 450MHz and a DPW500a.<p></p></li>

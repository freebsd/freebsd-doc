<h3>New FreeBSD Core Team Elected</h3>

<p><b>BSD Conference, Monterey, CA, October 18, 2000</b> The FreeBSD Project
announced today the election of a new Core Team, the project's management
oard.  This marks the first occasion on which the team has been selected
y means of an election among the project's developers.  Joining the Core
eam as new members are Greg Lehey, Warner Losh, Mike Smith, and Robert
atson.  Re-elected members are Satoshi Asami, David Greenman, Jordan
ubbard, Doug Rabson, and Peter Wemm.</p>

<p>FreeBSD Project co-founder and continuing Core Team member Jordan
Hubbard expressed excitement over the results, <cite>"For the first time
since the FreeBSD project was formed, open elections have determined
the composition of its core team and set an important precedent
whereby any developer can now become part of the project's
leadership."</cite>  The new core team also well-represents FreeBSD's
diverse and highly skilled group of international developers, with
expertise ranging from RAID file system and device-driver development
to extensive security backgrounds.</p>

<p>New Core Team members were elected from and by the FreeBSD committers
team, the formal development staff of the FreeBSD project.  Committers
have direct access to the FreeBSD source repository, and perform the
majority of software development associated with the project.  Until this
point, the Core Team was a self-selected board providing architectural and
administrative direction.</p>

<p>This summer, the committers voted to move to a democratic model allowing
the project to adapt to the changing development requirements of the open
source operating system community.  However, with over half of the prior
Core Team re-elected, strong continuity exists.</p>

<p>Departing Core Team member Poul-Henning Kamp said, <cite>"I'm
very proud of what we have done together in the Core Team over the last
8 years.  The new Core, and the fact that they are elected by the
committers, means that the project will be much more responsive to
change in the future."</cite></p>

<p>The changing of the guard in project leadership comes amid good feelings,
Kamp indicated: all past Core members will continue on with the project
with increased emphasis on development, <cite>"Now I get to spend more time on
the FreeBSD source code instead of on project management."</cite></p>

<h3>About FreeBSD</h3>

<p>FreeBSD is a liberally-licensed open source operating system with its
origins in BSD Net/2 and 4.4 Lite, the Berkeley Software Distributions
developed at the University of California at Berkeley until 1994.  It
is developed and maintained by a global organization of paid and
volunteer contributors.  FreeBSD is distinguished by its high
performance networking and file system support, and is widely used
among Internet service providers, including industry-recognized
companies such as <b>Yahoo!</b>, <b>above.net</b>,
and <b>Verio</b>.  FreeBSD is also
frequently used as a platform for embedded networking devices,

<p>With the help of some 'friends' on the FreeBSD-hackers list, I have
been able to create a diskless X terminal... The creation of the X terminal
required first creating a diskless system with minimal utilities mounted
via NFS. These same steps were used to create 2 separate diskless systems.
The first is 'altair.kcis.com'. A diskless X terminal that I run on my
old 386DX-40. It has a 340Meg hard disk but, I did not want to change it.
So, it boots from 'antares.kcis.com' across a ethernet. The second system
is a 486DX2-66. I setup a diskless FreeBSD (complete) that uses no local
disk. The server in that case is a Sun 670MP running
SunOS 4.1.3. The same setup configuration was needed for both.</p>

NOTE: 	I am sure that there is stuff that needs to be added to this. Please send me any comments....

<h2>Creating the boot floppy (On the diskless system)</h2>

<p>Since the network boot loaders will not work with some of
the TSR's and such that MS-DOS uses, it is best to create
a dedicated boot floppy OR, if you can, create an MS-DOS menu
that will (via the config.sys/autoexec.bat files) ask what
configuration to load when the system starts. The later is the
method that I use and it works great. My MS-DOS (6.x) menu is below.</p>
<pre>
	---- config.sys ----
	[menu]
	menuitem=normal, normal
	menuitem=unix, unix
	[normal]
	....
	normal config.sys stuff
	...
	[unix]
	----

	---- autoexec.bat ----
	@ECHO OFF
	goto %config%

	:normal
	...
	normal autoexec.bat stuff
	...
	goto end

	:unix
	cd \netboot
	nb8390.com

	:end
	----</pre>

<h2>Getting the network boot programs (On the server)</h2>

<p>Compile the 'net-boot' programs that are located in
/usr/src/sys/i386/boot/netboot. You should read the comments
at the top of the makefile. Adjust as required. !!!! make a
backup of the original in case it gets fobar'd !!! When the build
is done, there should be 2 MS-DOS executables, 'nb8390.com' and
'nb3c509.com'. One of these two programs will be what you need
to run on the diskless server. It will load the kernel from the
boot server. At this point, put both programs on the MS-DOS
boot floppy created earlier.

<h2>Determine which program to run (On the diskless system)</h2>

<p>If you know the chipset that your ethernet adapter uses, this is
easy. If you have the NS8390 chipset, or a NS8390 based chipset,
use NB8390.COM. If you have a 3Com 509 based chipset, use the
NB3C509.COM boot program. If you are not sure which you have,
try using one, if it says 'No adapter found', try the other.
Beyond that, you are pretty much on your own.

<h2>Booting across the network</h2>

<p>Boot the diskless system with out any config.sys/autoexec.bat
files. try running the boot program for your ethernet adapter.</p>
<pre>		
	My ethernet adapter is running in WD8013 16bit mode so
	I run NB8390.COM

	C:> cd \netboot
	C:> nb8390

		Boot from Network (Y/N) ?  Y

		BOOTP/TFTP/NFS bootstrap loader     ESC for menu

		Searching for adapter..
		WD8013EBT base 0x0300, memory 0x000D8000, addr 00:40:01:43:26:66

		Searching for server..</pre>

<p>At this point, my diskless system is trying to find a machine to act
as a boot server. Make note of the addr line above, you will need this
number later. Reset the diskless system and modify your config.sys and
autoexec.bat files to do these steps automatically for you. Perhaps in
a menu. If you had to run 'nb3c509.com' instead of 'nb8390.com' the
output is the same as above. If you got 'No adapter found' at the
'Searching for adapter..' message, verify that you did indeed set the
compile time defines in the makefile correctly.</p>

<h2>Allowing systems to boot across the network (On the
      server)</h2>

<p>Make sure the /etc/inetd.conf file has entries for tftp and bootps.
Mine are listed below:</p>
<pre>
	---- /etc/inetd.conf ----
	tftp	dgram	udp	wait	nobody	/usr/libexec/tftpd	tftpd
	#
	# Additions by who ever you are
	bootps  dgram  udp  wait  root  /usr/libexec/bootpd bootpd /etc/bootptab
	----
</pre>
<p>If you have to change the /etc/inetd.conf file, send a HUP signal to
inetd. To do this, get the process ID of inetd with 'ps -ax | grep
inetd | grep -v grep'. Once you have it, send it a HUP signal. Do this
by 'kill -HUP &lt;pid&gt;'. This will force inetd to re-read its config file.</p>

<p>Did you remember to note the 'addr' line from the output of the boot
loader on the diskless system???? Guess what, here is where you need it.</p>

<p>Add an entry to /etc/bootptab (maybe creating the file). It should be
laid out identical to this:</p>

<pre>
	altair:\
		:ht=ether:\
		:ha=004001432666:\
		:sm=255.255.255.0:\
		:hn:\
		:ds=199.246.76.1:\
		:ip=199.246.76.2:\
		:gw=199.246.76.1:\
		:vm=rfc1048:

	The lines are as follows:
		'altair' the diskless systems name without the domain name.
		'ht=ether' the hardware type of 'ethernet'.
		'ha=004001432666' the hardware address (the number noted above).
		'sm=255.255.255.0' the subnet mask.
		'hn' tells server to send client's hostname to the client.
		'ds=199.246.76.1' tells the client who the domain server is.
		'ip=199.246.76.2' tells the client what it's IP address is.
		'gw=199.246.76.1' tells the client what the default gateway is.
		'vm=...' just leave it there...
</pre>
<p>NOTE: 
****** Be sure to setup the IP addresses correctly, the addresses
above are my own......</p>

<p>Create the directory '/tftpboot' on the server it will contain the
configuration files for the diskless systems that the server will
serve. These files will be named 'cfg.&lt;ip&gt;' where &lt;ip&gt; is the IP
address of the diskless system. The config file for 'altair' is
/tftpboot/cfg.199.246.76.2. The contents is:</p>

<pre>
	---- /tftpboot/cfg.199.246.76.2 ----
	rootfs 199.246.76.1:/DiskLess/rootfs/altair
	hostname altair.kcis.com
	----
</pre>
<p>The line 'hostname altair.kcis.com' simply tells the diskless
system what its fully qualified domain name is.</p>

<p>The line 'rootfs 199.246.76.1:/DiskLess/rootfs/altair' tells the
diskless system where its NFS mountable root filesystem is located.</p>

<p>NOTE:!!!!! The NFS mounted root filesystem will be mounted READ ONLY.</p>

<p>The hierarchy for the diskless system can be re-mounted allowing
read-write operations if required.</p>

<p>I use my spare 386DX-40 as a dedicated X terminal...</p>

<p>The hierarchy for 'altair' is:</p>

Subject: Introduction to MH for FreeBSD Handbook

Okay I've diverged from my original plan on the handbook and condensed it a
bit. If I find some time I am going to start working on something about how
to use sendmail, since I imagine that would be a bit more useful. Here is my 
guide to using mh on freebsd. Let me know what changes it might need or 
things that need to be clearer or shorter.

<!-- This section is here to explain the philosophy behind MH Also
 make sure that the user has installed the mh package --> 
MH started back in 1977 at the RAND Corporation, where the initial
philosophies behind MH were developed. MH isn't so much a monolithic
email program but a philosophy about how best to develop tools for
reading email. The MH developers have done a great job adhering to the
KISS principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. Rather than have one large
program for reading, sending and handling email they have written
specialized programs for each part of your email life. One might liken
MH to the specialization that one finds in insects and nature. Each
tool in MH does one thing, and does it very well.

Beyond just the various tools that one uses to handle their email MH
has done an excellent job keeping the configuration of each of these
tools consistent and uniform. In fact, if you are not quite sure how
something is supposed to work or what the arguments for some command
are supposed to be then you can generally guess and be right. Each MH
command is consistent about how it handles reading the configuration
files and how it takes arguments on the command line. One useful thing
to remember is that you can always add a <tt/-help/ to the command to
have it display the options for that command.

The first thing that you need to do is to make sure that you have
installed the MH package on your FreeBSD machine. If you installed
from CDROM you should be able to execute the following to load mh:
<tscreen><verb>
pkg_add /cdrom/packages/mh-6.8.3.tgz
</verb></tscreen>
You will notice that it created a /usr/local/lib/mh directory for you
as well as adding several binaries to the /usr/local/bin directory. If
you would prefer to compile it yourself then you can anonymous ftp it
from <url url="ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/" name="ftp.ics.uci.edu"> or <url
url="ftp://louie.udel.edu/" name="louie.udel.edu">. 

This primer is not a full comprehensive explanation of how MH
works. This is just intended to get you started on the road to
happier, faster mail reading. You should read the man pages for the
various commands. Also you might want to read the <url
url="news:comp.mail.mh" name="comp.mail.mh"> newsgroup. Also you can
read the <url
url="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mh-faq/part1/faq.html"
name="FAQ"> for MH. The best resource for MH is the O'Reilly and
Associates book written by Jerry Peek.

<sect>Reading Mail
<p>
<!-- This section covers how to use inc, msgchk, next, prev, rmm, and rmf -->
This section covers how to use <tt/inc/, <tt/show/, <tt/scan/,
<tt/next/, <tt/prev/, <tt/rmm/, <tt/rmf/, and <tt/msgchk/. 
One of the best things about MH is the consistent interface between
programs. A few things to keep in mind when using these commands is
how to specify message lists. In the case of <em/inc/ this doesn't
really make any sense but with commands like <em/show/ it is useful to
know. 

A message list can consist of something like <tt/23 20 16/ which will
act on messages 23, 20 and 16. This is fairly simple but you can do
more useful things like <tt/23-30/ which will act on all the messages
between 23 and 30. You can also specify something like <tt/cur:10/
which will act on the current message and the next 9 messages. The
<tt/cur/, <tt/last/, and <tt/first/ messages are special messages that
refer to the current, last or first message in the folder. 

<sect1><heading>inc, msgchk - read in your new email or check it<label id="inc"></>
<p>
If you just type in <em>inc</em> and hit return you will be well on your
way to getting started with MH. The first time you run <em>inc</em> it
will setup your account to use all the MH defaults and ask you about
creating a Mail directory. If you have mail waiting to be downloaded
you will see something that looks like:

</verb></tscreen>
This is the same thing you will see from a ``<ref id="scan">''. If you
just run <em>inc</em> with no arguments it will look on your computer for email
that is supposed to be coming to you. 

A lot of people like to use POP for grabbing their email. MH can do
POP to grab your email. You will need to give <em>inc</em> a few command
line arguments. 
<tscreen><verb>
inc -host mail.pop.org -user username -norpop
</verb></tscreen>
That tells <em>inc</> to go to <bf/mail.pop.org/ to download your
email, and that your username on their system is <bf/username/. The
<tt>-norpop</tt> option tells <em>inc</em> to use plain POP3 for
downloading your email. MH has support for a few different dialects of
POP. More than likely you will never ever need to use them
though. While you can do more complex things with inc such as audit
files and scan format files this will get you going.

The <em/msgchk/ command is used to get information on whether or not
you have new email. <em/msgchk/ takes the same <tt/-host/ and
<tt/-user/ options that <em/inc/ takes. 

<sect1><heading>show, next and prev - displaying and moving through emails
<label id="show"></>
<p>
<em/show/ is to show a letter in your current folder. Like inc,
<em/show/ is a fairly straightforward command. If you just type
<em/show/ and hit return then it displays the current message. You can
also give specific message numbers to show:
<tscreen><verb>
show 32 45 56
</verb></tscreen>
This would display message numbers 32, 45 and 56 right after each
other. Unless you change the default behavior <em/show/ basically just
does a more on the email message.

<em/next/ is used to move onto the next message and <em/prev/ will go
to the previous message. Both commands have an implied <em/show/
command so that when you go to the next message it automatically
displays it. 

<sect1><heading>scan - shows you a scan of your messages<label id="scan"></>
<p>

<em/scan/ will display a brief listing of the messages in your current
folder. This is an example of what the <em/scan/ command will give you.
<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>
Like just about everything in MH this display is very
configurable. This is the typical default display. It gives you the
message number, the date on the email, the sender, the subject line,
and a sentence fragment from the very beginning of the email if it can
fit it. The + means that message is the current message, so if you do
a <em/show/ it will display that message. 

One useful option for scan is the <tt/-reverse/ option. This will list
your messages with the highest message number first and lowest message
number last. Another useful option with <em/scan/ is to have it
read from a file. If you want to scan your incoming mailbox on FreeBSD
without having to <em/inc/ it you can do <tt>scan -file
/var/mail/username</tt>. This can be used with any file that is in the
<bf/mbox/ format.

<sect1><heading>rmm and rmf - remove the current message or folder
<label id="rmm"></>
<p>
<em/rmm/ is used to remove a mail message. The default is typically to
not actually remove the message but to rename the file to one that is
ignored by the MH commands. You will need to through periodically and
physically delete the "removed" messages.

The <em/rmf/ command is used to remove folders. This doesn't just
rename the files but actually removes the from the hard drive so you
should be careful when you use this command.

<sect1><heading>A typical session of reading with MH<label id="samplereading"></>
<p>
The first thing that you will want to do is <em/inc/ your new mail. So
at a shell prompt just type in <em/inc/ and hit return.

Then if I wanted to read message number 27 I would do a <tt/show 27/
and it would be displayed. As you can probably tell from this sample
session MH is pretty easy to use and looking through emails and
displaying them is fairly intuitive and easy. 

<sect>Folders and Mail Searching
<p>
Anybody who gets lots of email definitely wants to be able to
prioritize, stamp, brief, de-brief, and number their emails in a
variety of different ways. MH can do this better than just about
anything. One thing that we haven't really talked about is the concept
of folders. You have undoubtedly come across the folders concept using
other email programs. MH has folders too. MH can even do sub-folders
of a folder. One thing you should keep in mind with MH is that when
you ran <em/inc/ for the first time and it asked you if it could
create a Mail directory it began storing everything in that
directory. If you look at that directory you will find a directory
named <bf/inbox/. The <bf/inbox/ directory houses all of your incoming
mail that hasn't been thrown anywhere else. 

Whenever you create a new folder a new directory is going to be
created underneath your MH Mail directory, and messages in that folder
are going to be stored in that directory. When new email comes in that
new email is thrown into your inbox directory with a file name that is
equivalent to the message number. So even if you didn't have any of
the MH tools to read your email you could still use standard UNIX
commands to munge around in those directories and just more your
files. It's this simplicity that really gives you a lot of power with
what you can do with your email. 

Just as you can use message lists like <tt/23 16 42/ with most MH
commands there is a folder option you can specify with just about
every MH command. If you do a <tt/scan +freebsd/ it will scan your
freebsd folder, and your current folder will be changed to freebsd. If
you do a <tt/show +freebsd 23 16 42/ <em/show/ is going to switch to
your freebsd folder and display messages 23, 16 and 42. So remember
that +folder syntax. You will need to make sure you use it to make
commands process different folders. Remember you default folder for
mail is inbox so doing a <tt/folder +inbox/ should always get you back
to your mail. Of course, in MH's infinite flexibility this can be
changed but most places have probably left it as inbox.

<!-- This section covers how to use pick, folder{s}, and slocal 
This needs to cover the general +folder format and an overview on the
directory structure here. -->
<sect1>pick - search email that matches certain criteria
<p>
<em/pick/ is one of the more complex commands in the MH system. So you
might want to read the pick man page for a more thorough
understanding. At its simplest level you can do something like
<tscreen><verb>
tempest% pick -search pci
15
42
55
56
57
</verb></tscreen>
This will tell <em/pick/ to look through every single line in every
message in your current folder and tell you which message numbers it
found the word pci in. You can then <em/show/ those messages and read
them if you wish or <em/rmm/ them. You would have to specify something
like <tt/show 15 42 55-57/ to display them though. A slightly more
useful thing to do is this:
<tscreen><verb>
tempest% pick -search pci -seq pick
5 hits
tempest% show pick
</verb></tscreen>
This will show you the same messages you just didn't have to work as
hard to do it. The <tt/-seq/ option is really an abbreviation of
<tt/-sequence/ and <bf/pick/ is just a sequence which contains the
message numbers that matched. You can use sequences with just about
any MH command. So you could have done an <tt/rmm pick/ and all those
messages would be removed instead. You sequence can be named
anything. If you run pick again it will overwrite the old sequence if
you use the same name. 

Doing a <tt/pick -search/ can be a bit more time consuming than just
searching for message from someone, or to someone. So <em/pick/ allows
you to use the following predefined search criteria:
<itemize>
<item><tt/-to/ search based upon who the message is to
<item><tt/-cc/ search based on who is in the cc list
<item><tt/-from/ search for who sent the message
<item><tt/-subject/ search for emails with this subject
<item><tt/-date/ find emails with a matching dat
<item><tt>--<em>component</em></tt> search for any other component in
the header. (i.e. --reply-to to find all emails with a certain
reply-to in the header)
</itemize>

This allows you to do things like
<tscreen><verb>
pick -to freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org -seq hackers
</verb></tscreen>
to get a list of all the email send to the FreeBSD hackers mailing
list. <em/pick/ also allows you to group these criteria in different
ways using the following options:
<itemize>
<item>... <tt/-and/ ...
<item>... <tt/-or/ ...
<item><tt/-not/ ...
<item><tt/-lbrace/ ... <tt/-rbrace/
</itemize>
These commands allow you to do things like
<tscreen><verb>
pick -to freebsd-hackers -and -cc freebsd-hackers
</verb></tscreen>
That will grab all the email in your inbox that was sent to
freebsd-hackers or cc'd to that list. The brace options allow you to
group search criteria together. This is sometimes very necessary as
in the following example
<tscreen><verb>
pick -lbrace -to freebsd-hackers -and -not -cc freebsd-questions -rbrace
-and -subject pci
</verb></tscreen>
Basically this says pick (to freebsd-hackers and not cc'd on
freebsd-questions) and the subject is pci. It should look through your
folder and find all messages send to the freebsd-hackers list that
aren't cc'd to the freebsd-questions list that contain something on
pci in the subject line. Ordinarily you might have to worry about
something called operator precedence. Remember in math how you
evaluate from left to right and you do multiplication and division
first and addition and subtraction second? MH has the same type of
rules for <em/pick/. It's fairly complex so you might want to study
the man page. This document is just to help you get acquainted with
MH.

<sect1>folder, folders, refile  - three useful programs for folder maintenance
<p>
There are three programs which are primarily just for manipulating
your folders. The <em/folder/ program is used to switch between
folders, pack them, and list them. At its simplest level you can do a
<tt/folder +newfolder/ and you will be switched into
<bf/newfolder/. From there on out all your MH commands like <em/comp/,
<em/repl/, <em/scan/, and <em/show/ will act on that <bf/newfolder/
folder. Sometimes when you are reading and deleting messages you will
develop ``holes'' in your folders.

If you do a <em/scan/ you might just see messages
34, 35, 36, 43, 55, 56, 57, 80. If you do a <tt/folder -pack/ this
will renumber all your messages so that there are no holes. It doesn't
actually delete any messages though. So you may need to periodically
go through and physically delete <em/rmm/'d messages. 

If you need statistics on your folders you can do a <em/folders/ or
<tt/folder -all/ to list all your folders, how many messages they
have, what the current message is in each one and so on. This line of
stats it displays for all your folders is the same one you get when
you change to a folder with <tt/folder +foldername/. A <em/folders/
command looks like this:
<tscreen><verb>
                Folder      # of messages (  range  ); cur  msg  (other files)
              announce  has    1 message  (   1-   1).
                drafts  has   no messages.
             f-hackers  has   43 messages (   1-  43).
           f-questions  has   16 messages (   1-  16).
                 inbox+ has   35 messages (   1-  38); cur=  37.
                 lists  has    8 messages (   1-   8).
             netfuture  has    1 message  (   1-   1).
                   out  has   31 messages (   1-  31).
              personal  has    6 messages (   1-   6).
                  todo  has   58 messages (   1-  58); cur=   1.

                     TOTAL=  199 messages in 13 folders.

</verb></tscreen>

The <em/refile/ command is what you use to move messages between
folders. When you do something like <tt/refile 23 +netfuture/ message
number 23 is moved into the netfuture folder. You could also do
something like <tt/refile 23 +netfuture/latest/ which would put
message number 23 in a subfolder called latest under the netfuture
folder. If you want to keep a message in the current folder and link
it you can do a <tt/refile -link 23 +netfuture/ which would keep 23 in
your current inbox but also list in your netfuture folder. You are
probably beginning to realize some of the really powerful things you
can do with MH.

<sect>Sending Mail
<p>
<!-- This section covers how to use comp, repl and forw -->
Email is a two way street for most people so you want to be able to
send something back. The way MH handles sending mail can be a bit
difficult to follow at first, but it allows for incredible
flexibility. The first thing MH does is to copy a components file into
your outgoing email. A components file is basically a skeleton email
letter with stuff like the To: and Subject: headers already in it. 
You are then sent into your editor where you fill in the header
information and then type the body of your message below the dashed
lines in the message. Then to the <em/whatnow/ program. When you are at the
``What now?'' prompt you can tell it to <bf/send/, <bf/list/,
<bf/edit/, <bf/edit/, <bf/push/, and <bf/quit/. Most of these commands
are self-explanatory. So the message sending process involves copying
a component file, editing your email, and then telling the
<em/whatnow/ program what to do with your email.

<sect1><heading>comp, forw, reply - compose, forward or reply to a message to someone</>
<p>
The <em/comp/ program has a few useful command line options. The most
important one to know right now is the <tt/-editor/ option. When MH is
installed the default editor is usually a program called <em/prompter/
which comes with MH. It's not a very exciting editor and basically
just gets the job done. So when you go to compose a message to someone
you might want to use <tt/comp -editor /usr/bin/vi/ or <tt/comp
-editor /usr/local/bin/pico/ instead. Once you have run <em/comp/ you
are in your editor and you see something that looks like this:
<tscreen><verb>
To:
cc:
Subject:
--------

</verb></tscreen>
You need to put the person you are sending the mail to after the To:
line. It works the same way for the other headers also, so you would
need to put your subject after the Subject: line. Then you would just
put the body of your message after the dashed lines. It may seem a bit
simplistic since a lot of email programs have special requesters that
ask you for this information but there really isn't any point to
that. Plus this really gives you excellent flexibility.
<tscreen><verb>
To:freebsd-rave@freebsd.org
cc:
Subject:And on the 8th day God created the FreeBSD core team
--------
Wow this is an amazing operating system. Thanks!
</verb></tscreen>
You can now save this message and exit your editor. You will see the
<tt/What now?/ prompt and you can type in <tt/send/ or <tt/s/ and hit
return. Then the freebsd core team will receive their just rewards. As
I mentioned earlier you can also send other commands, for example
<tt/quit/ if you don't want to send the message.

The <em/forw/ command is stunningly similar. The big difference
being that the message you are forwarding is automatically included in
the outgoing message. When you run <em/forw/ it will forward your
current message. You can always tell it to forward something else by
doing something like <tt/forw 23/ and then message number 23 will be
put in your outgoing message instead of the current message. Beyond
those small differences <em/forw/ functions exactly the same as
<em/comp/. You go through the exact same message sending process.

The <em/repl/ command will reply to whatever your current message is,
unless you give it a different message to reply to. <em/repl/ will do
its best to go ahead and fill in some of the email headers already. So
you will notice that the To: header already has the address of the
recipient in there. Also the Subject: line will already be filled
in. You then go about the normal message composition process and you
are done. One useful command line option to know here is the <tt/-cc/
option. You can use <bf/all/, <bf/to/, <bf/cc/, <bf/me/ after the
<tt/-cc/ option to have <em/repl/ automatically add the various
addresses to the cc list in the message. You have probably noticed
that the original message isn't included. This is because most MH
setups are configured to do this from the start.

<sect1> components, and replcomps - components files for comp and repl
<p>
The <em/components/ file is usually in <tt>/usr/local/lib/mh</tt>. You
can copy that file into your MH Mail directory and edit to contain
what you want it to contain. It is a fairly basic file. You have
various email headers at the top, a dashed line and then nothing. The
<em/comp/ command just copies this <em/components/ file and then edits
it. You can any kind of valid RFC822 header you want. For instance you
could have something like this in your <em/components/ file:
<tscreen><verb>

MH would then copy this components file and throw you into your
editor. The <em/components/ file is fairly simple. If you wanted to
have a signature on those messages you would just put your signature
in that <em/components/ file.

The <em/replcomps/ file is a bit more complex. The default
<em/replcomps/ looks like this:
<tscreen><verb>
%(lit)%(formataddr %<{reply-to}%?{from}%?{sender}%?{return-path}%>)\
%<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr To: )\n%>\
%(lit)%(formataddr{to})%(formataddr{cc})%(formataddr(me))\
%<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr cc: )\n%>\
%<{fcc}Fcc: %{fcc}\n%>\
%<{subject}Subject: Re: %{subject}\n%>\
%<{date}In-reply-to: Your message of "\
%<(nodate{date})%{date}%|%(pretty{date})%>."%<{message-id}
             %{message-id}%>\n%>\
--------

</verb></tscreen>
It's in the same basic format as the <em/components/ file but it
contains quite a few extra formatting codes. The %(lit) command makes
room for the address. The %(formataddr is a function that returns a
proper email address. The next part is %< which means if and the
{reply-to} means the reply-to field in the original message. So that
might be translated this way:

<tscreen>
%<<bf/if/ {reply-to} <bf/the original message has a reply-to/ 
then give that to formataddr, %? <bf/else/ {from} <bf/take the
from address/, %? <bf/else/ {sender} <bf/take the sender address/, %?
<bf/else/ {return-path} <bf/take the return-path from the original
message/, %> <bf/endif/.
</tscreen>

As you can tell MH formatting can get rather involved. You can
probably decipher what most of the other functions and variables
mean. All of the information on writing these format strings is in the
MH-Format man page. The really nice thing is that once you have built
your customized <em/replcomps/ file you won't need to touch it
again. No other email program really gives you the power and
flexibility that MH gives you.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the hardware compatibility notes for FreeBSD X.0.
It lists the hardware platforms supported by FreeBSD, as well as the various types of hardware devices (storage controllers, network interfaces, and so on), along with known working instances of these devices.

[[proc]]
== Supported Processors and System Boards

This section provides some architecture-specific information about the specific processors and systems that are supported by each architecture.

[[proc-amd64]]
=== 64-bit x86 (amd64) Architecture Support

FreeBSD supports the AMD64 ("Hammer") and Intel(R) EM64T architectures.
AMD64 (also known as x86-64) is a fully-supported Tier 1 architecture.
AMD64 supports all modern x86 processors.
This release incorporates optimizations and enhancements to leverage the full capabilities of FreeBSD/amd64-based systems, delivering improved performance across a wide range of workloads.

[[proc-i386]]
=== i386 Architecture Support

While FreeBSD continues to evolve and optimize for modern architectures, we are committed to maintaining support for the venerable i386 (x86) architecture in this release.
Although i386 hardware is becoming less common, FreeBSD remains a reliable and versatile choice for those who still rely on it, whether for legacy systems or specific use cases.

[[proc-arm]]
=== ARM Architecture Support

FreeBSD features robust ARM architecture support, enhancing compatibility and performance across a diverse array of ARM-based devices.

[[proc-arm-64]]

[[proc-risc-v]]
=== RISC-V Architecture Support

RISC-V support in FreeBSD represents a significant milestone in the evolution of this open-source operating system.
FreeBSD was the first operating system to have bootable in-tree support for RISC-V, underscoring its commitment to embracing emerging hardware architectures.

FreeBSD currently supports the following platforms:

* HiFive Unleashed (SiFive FU540)
* HiFive Unmatched (SiFive FU740)
* Spike
* QEMU

More information about the support at the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/riscv[Wiki page].

[[proc-powerpc]]
=== PowerPC Architecture Support

Many PowerPC platforms are supported, including but not limited to:

* Apple PowerMac G4 and later.
* IBM POWER4 and later using pseries VM platform.
* IBM POWER8 and later bare metal powernv
** Most development done using Raptor TALOS-II
* Embedded NXP QorIQ and PowerQUICC III (MPC85XX, Pxxx)
** Tested on AmigaOne X5000 and AmigaOne A1222

// The "Supported Devices" section of the release notes.
// Generally processor-independent, with conditional text
// inclusion handling any architecture-dependent text.

// Within each subsection describing a class of hardware
// (i.e. Ethernet interfaces), list broad groups of devices
// alphabetically as paragraphs sorted alphabetically (frequently
// these groups will be arranged by manufacturer, i.e. 3Com
// Ethernet interfaces).

// Where applicable, a "Miscellaneous" section may follow all
// other named sections.

// These guidelines are not hard-and-fast rules, and exceptions
// will occur.  Following these guidelines (vague as they may be)
// is highly recommended to try to keep the formatting of
// this section consistent.

// We give manpage references using the &man entities where
// possible.  If a driver has no manpage (and consequently no
// &man entity, we simply give the name of the driver).
// Please avoid doing &man entity conversions unless you
// know for sure that an entity and manpage exist; sweeps through
// this file to fix "missed" conversions are likely to break the
// build.

[[support]]
== Supported Devices

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by FreeBSD.
Other configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested yet.
Feedback, updates, and corrections to this list are encouraged.

Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class of devices is listed.
If the driver in question has a manual page in the FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here.
Information on specific models of supported devices, controllers, etc. can be found in the manual pages.

[NOTE]
====
The device lists in this document are being generated automatically from FreeBSD manual pages.
This means that some devices, which are supported by multiple drivers, may appear multiple times.

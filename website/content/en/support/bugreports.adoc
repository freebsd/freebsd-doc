A problem report, or _PR_, can be about any component of FreeBSD, including problems with the operating system programs, a mistake in the documentation, or a new feature that the submitter wishes to see incorporated.

Problem reports begin in the _new_ state, and are closed when the issue is resolved. A numeric ID is assigned to each PR for tracking. Many FreeBSD changes refer to the PR number that prompted the change.

== How to Submit a Problem Report

Problem reports are submitted to the development team with the https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/submit/[web form]. An account will need to be created before a bug can be submitted. Please note that messages sent to a mailing list are _not_ tracked as official problem reports, and may get lost in the noise!

Before submitting a problem report, please read the link:{problem-reports}[Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports] article. This article describes when to submit a problem report and what to include. Some useful background information is also contained in the link:{pr-guidelines}[Problem Report Handling Guidelines] article.

FreeBSD problem reports are tracked using http://www.bugzilla.org/[Bugzilla].

= The FreeBSD GNOME Project

== What software does the GNOME Team maintain?

The GNOME Team maintains the GNOME, MATE, and Cinnamon desktop environments.

== What is GNOME?

GNOME is a complete graphical desktop for X, including everything from a window manager to web browsers, audio players, office programs, graphical login programs and more.
MATE is a continuation of the old GNOME 2 desktop environment.
Cinnamon was originally a fork of GNOME 3's gnome-shell, but grew into its own desktop environment.

== How to install these desktop environments?

There are some so called meta ports available for installing these desktop environments or parts of them.
They are: 

* gnome3 (full GNOME desktop)
* gnome3-lite (minimal GNOME desktop)
* mate (full MATE desktop)
* mate-lite (minimal MATE desktop)
* cinnamon

The easiest way of installing is to run the following command and replace gnome with the desktop environment of choice:

....
# pkg install gnome
....

Or if you prefer to build from source:

....
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome
# make install clean
....

== State of the port:

GNOME, MATE, and Cinnamon for FreeBSD are currently fully supported.

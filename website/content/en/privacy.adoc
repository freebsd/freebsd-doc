The foregoing information is collectively referred to below as "Your Usage Data."

We store information such as your email address, name, and organization or company ("Personally Identifiable Information") only if you decide to send us such information by submitting a FreeBSD bug or problem report ("PR"), subscribing to one of the FreeBSD mailing lists or posting content to our Site forums. The FreeBSD Project allows unlimited distribution of that content. Information submitted in those reports and lists, including your Personally Identifiable Information, is considered public and will be accessible to anyone on the web.

Anonymized aggregate traffic data about website visits may be shared for marketing or research purposes.

The FreeBSD Project uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics is a tool that enables the FreeBSD Project to see how visitors to our Site use our Site and how they arrive at our Site. Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help our Site to analyze visitor activity. We send Google Analytics data that reports on your use of the Site. That data includes Your Usage Data and is not anonymised before it is transmitted to Google Analytics. This un-anonymised data is stored by Google on servers, once it is transmitted to Google. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer Your Usage Data to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate Your Usage Data with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Site. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of Your Usage Data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

With the exception of the transmission of Your Usage Data to Google for the sole purpose of using Google Analytics and the public access we permit to the bug reports you submit, the mailing lists you subscribe to, and posting content to our Site forums, the FreeBSD Project does not share un-anonymised data with anyone.

== Updates to this privacy policy:

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.

== Sale of assets:

In the unlikely event that The FreeBSD Project or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets.

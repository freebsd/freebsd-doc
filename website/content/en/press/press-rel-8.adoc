= FreeBSD Project Launches FreeBSD 6.0

== FreeBSD raises the bar for open source operating systems.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE +
Berkeley, CA November 4, 2005

The FreeBSD Project announces the availability of FreeBSD 6.0, an open source operating system derived from BSD UNIX, which offers a powerful alternative to Linux, Solaris, and Windows. FreeBSD enables enterprise organizations to utilize open source technologies that focus on reliability, security, and scalability.

"Yahoo! is impressed with the performance and stability of FreeBSD 6.0," says David Filo, Yahoo! co-founder. Yahoo! is one of many enterprise companies that rely on the world-renowned stability and performance of the FreeBSD operating system.

One of the new features in FreeBSD 6.0 is a multithreaded filesystem, which greatly improves data access times for local disks, RAID configurations, network filesystems, and SANs. Recent performance benchmarks show that FreeBSD 6.0 outperforms Linux in raw data throughput.

Additionally, FreeBSD 6.0 extends support for wireless devices such as Intel Centrino and adds support for the popular new WPA wireless security protocol. Several improvements are incorporated into NDISulator, a component of the operating system that allows Windows network drivers to run natively under FreeBSD.

FreeBSD now scales much more efficiently across multiple processor systems. Support for 8 or more processors, such as the new dual core AMD Opteron configurations, gives consumers a viable alternative against more expensive, proprietary hardware platforms and operating systems from IBM, HP, and Sun.

== About the FreeBSD Project

The FreeBSD Project provides a free, open source operating system for several platforms, including Intel x86 and AMD64. FreeBSD is derived from BSD, the version of UNIX developed at UC Berkeley. The unencumbered BSD license permits modification and redistribution of the software while allowing an individual or company to retain intellectual property.

= User Data Policy

== Rationale

The FreeBSD Project provides several resources for developers including various machines and data storage. These resources are intended to be used for activities related to the FreeBSD Project. The project does not make any guarantees to developers regarding non-project-related data stored on project resources. Developers are strongly encouraged to not use project resources for storing non-project-related data. The FreeBSD Core team approved the following user data policy which was posted to the Developers mailing list on August 4, 2011.

== Policy

FreeBSD Project resources should only be used for project-related activities and storing project-related data.

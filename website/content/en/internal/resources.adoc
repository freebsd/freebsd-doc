= Commit Bit and Project Resources Policy

== Rationale

The core team manages access to project resources including granting and revoking both commit bits and user accounts. Core may delegate portions of these tasks to other groups or individuals at its discretion. For example, certain commit bits are managed by other groups as noted in link:{committers-guide}#committer.types[Commit Bit Types] subject to core's final approval. The core team has held this authority since its inception, but wanted to make it explicit to avoid confusion. The FreeBSD Core team approved the following commit bit and project resources policy which was posted to the Developers mailing list on August 4, 2011.

== Policy

The core team has sole authority for managing access to project resources. This includes granting and revoking both commit bits and user accounts.

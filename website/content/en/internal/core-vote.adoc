= Core's Voting Procedures

== Committers

* All core members vote "yes", "no" or "no objection".
* Successful candidates must get at least one yes vote.
* Successful candidates must not get any 'no' votes.
* At least three people must vote.
* Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the result is certain.
* Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification, etc.

== Personnel

* All core members vote "yes" or "no".
* Successful candidates must get at least (2/3 * core-size) yes vote.
* At least (2/3 * core-size) people must vote, or the measure will fail.
* Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the result is certain.
* Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification, etc.

== Issues

* Discussion takes place.
* When a consensus resolution appears to have been reached, a vote on that takes place.
* All core members vote "yes" or "no".
* Successful resolutions must get at least (2/3 * core-size) yes vote.
* At least (2/3 * core-size) people must vote, or the measure will fail.
* Voting period is normally 1 week, or ending sooner when the result is certain.
* Core secretary to deal with the details of voting, notification, etc.

== Without Objection

* Any core member may ask core, via email, if they can take some mundane action, subject to a quick sanity check of the rest of core.
* If no one objects within 48 hours, then that person may proceed (or sooner if (2/3 * core-size) members agree).
* If there are any objections, then it will be resolved via the issue voting procedure.
* Core secretary may send the OK to proceed message, as the secretary deems appropriate.

Any committer may also use this mechanism so long as at least one core member says 'yes' and the previous paragraph is otherwise followed. It is intended to be used for mundane matters that need a quick sanity check, but don't need a more heavy weight and deliberative process. It is believed that the subset of core present for any given 48 period are sufficient for both sanity checking mundane matters and recognizing non-mundane matters that need to be handled via the issues voting procedure.

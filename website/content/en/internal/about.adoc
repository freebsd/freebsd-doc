The original web pages were put together by John Fieber <jfieber@FreeBSD.org> with input from the FreeBSD community and *you*. 
https://wolfram.schneider.org[Wolfram Schneider] was our first webmaster but this responsibility is now shared by a larger team of web and documentation contributors.

The current website design was done by Emily Boyd as part of the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com[Google Summer of Code] program in 2005.

The original page design was done by Megan McCormack.

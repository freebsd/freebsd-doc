Naturally, all systems in the FreeBSD.org cluster run FreeBSD. The hardware and network connection have been generously provided by https://www.bytemark.co.uk/[Bytemark Hosting], https://www.isc.org/[Internet Systems Consortium], https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cswebsite/[National Chiao Tung University], https://www.nyi.net/[New York Internet], https://www.rootbsd.net//[RootBSD], https://www.yandex.com/[Yandex], https://www.yahoo.com/[Yahoo!], and other link:../../donations/donors[contributors] to the FreeBSD project.

A list of general-access machines in the FreeBSD.org domain is available at the link:../machines[The FreeBSD.org Network] page.

== The Software

These pages are served up by the fast and flexible http://www.nginx.org/[nginx webserver]. In addition, there are a few locally crafted CGI scripts. Indexing of the mailing list archive are provided by freewais-sf, a derivative of the CNIDR freewais.

== The Pages

[.right]

The original web pages were put together by John Fieber https://people.FreeBSD.org/~jfieber/[<jfieber@FreeBSD.org>] with input from the FreeBSD community and *you*. http://wolfram.schneider.org[<wosch@FreeBSD.org>] was our first webmaster but this responsibility is now shared by a larger team of web and documentation contributors. The FreeBSD pages are valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and should degrade gracefully on any browser.

== Page Design

The current website design was done by Emily Boyd as part of the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com[Google Summer of Code] program in 2005.

The original page design was done by Megan McCormack.

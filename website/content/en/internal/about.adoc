A list of general-access machines in the FreeBSD.org domain is available at the link:../machines[The FreeBSD.org Network] page.

== The Software

These pages are served up by the fast and flexible http://www.nginx.org/[NGINX webserver] and https://varnish-cache.org/[Varnish HTTP Cache].
In addition, there are a few locally crafted CGI scripts.
Indexing of the mailing list archive is provided by freewais-sf, a derivative of the CNIDR freewais.

== The Pages

The original web pages were put together by John Fieber https://people.FreeBSD.org/~jfieber/[<jfieber@FreeBSD.org>] with input from the FreeBSD community and *you*. http://wolfram.schneider.org[<wosch@FreeBSD.org>] was our first webmaster but this responsibility is now shared by a larger team of web and documentation contributors. The FreeBSD pages are valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and should degrade gracefully on any browser.

== Page Design

The current website design was done by Emily Boyd as part of the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com[Google Summer of Code] program in 2005.

The original page design was done by Megan McCormack.

== Update of the FreeBSD Web Pages

The FreeBSD Web Pages on `www.FreeBSD.org` are currently rebuilt according to the following schedule:

= FreeBSD Code of Conduct Reporting Instructions

== FreeBSD Code of Conduct Reporting Instructions

If you believe someone is violating the link:../code-of-conduct[code of conduct] we ask that you report it to the FreeBSD Code of Conduct Committee by emailing conduct@freebsd.org.

All reports will be kept confidential whenever possible. We strive to protect the identity and safety of reporters. In some cases we may need to make a public statement of some form, in which case we will use the minimum of details and identifying information necessary to protect our community. In rare cases, we may need to identify some of the people involved to comply with the law or protect other potential victims. In these cases, we will consult with the reporter to find out what their wishes are and take them into account in our final decision. In all cases, we will not directly or indirectly identify reporters without their consent unless we see no other option.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.

In your report please include:

* Your name and contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive, tweet, or a public IRC logger) please include a link and/or screen shots.
* Any extra context you believe relevant for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

== What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the FreeBSD Code of Conduct Committee acknowledging receipt of your report within 48 hours.

The committee will meet as quickly as possible to review the incident and determine:

* Whether an investigation is needed, including interviewing additional parties or witnesses;
* What appears to have happened and;
* Whether the behavior constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.

If a member of the FreeBSD Code of Conduct Committee is one of the individuals included in the report they will recuse themselves from handling the report.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Actions taken may include:

* Nothing (for example, if we determine that no violation occurred).
* If determined to be solely technical in nature or if it falls outside the scope of the Code of Conduct, forwarding the incident to the FreeBSD Core Team
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation from FreeBSD Project controlled spaces (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all FreeBSD Project controlled spaces (events, meetings, mailing lists, IRC, etc.)
* A request for a public or private apology.
* A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.

We will do our best to respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we have determined our final action, we will contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we will be taking. We will take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we do not guarantee we will act on it.

Finally, the committee will make a report on the situation to the FreeBSD Core Team. The Core Team may choose to issue a public report of the incident.

== Appeals

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the CoC Committee, contact the FreeBSD Core Team at core@freebsd.org with your appeal and the Core Team will review the case.

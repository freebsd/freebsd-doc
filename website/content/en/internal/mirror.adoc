= Mirroring the FreeBSD Web Pages

It is possible to mirror the FreeBSD web pages `www.FreeBSD.org`. This can be done using a program called _rsync_. rsync is a software package in the Ports Collection for distributing and updating collections of files across a network.

== Running rsync

If you keep your mirrored FreeBSD web pages in the directory `/usr/FreeBSD-mirror` and are owned by the user "fred", then run the following command as user "fred":

....
     $ rsync -vaHz --delete rsync://bit0.us-west.freebsd.org/FreeBSD-www-data/ /usr/FreeBSD-mirror/
....

This will mirror the FreeBSD web pages into `/usr/FreeBSD-mirror`. You can install this into fred's crontab, so that it runs once a day.

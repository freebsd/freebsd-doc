= User Groups

FreeBSD's widespread popularity has spawned a number of user groups around the world.

If you know of a FreeBSD user group not listed here, please fill out a link:../support/bugreports[problem report] in category Documentation->Website with the following information:

. A URL for the user group's website.
. An email contact address of a human in charge, for use by our visitors and website administrators.
. A short (one paragraph) description of the user group.

In keeping with the spirit of FreeBSD, we prefer user groups that are active and which conduct their business in public.
If there is no local group, http://bsd.meetup.com/ can be used to locate interested individuals near by.

Consider forming your own user group!

== Regions

FreeBSD User Groups can be found worldwide, connecting enthusiasts and professionals who share a passion for this versatile operating system.
Join a FreeBSD User Group in your region and become part of this vibrant community, networking and learning from fellow FreeBSD enthusiasts near you.

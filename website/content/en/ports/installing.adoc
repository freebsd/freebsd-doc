= Installing the FreeBSD Ports Collection

{{< form-ports >}}

'''''

The FreeBSD installer programs allow the Ports Collection to be installed at the same time as the operating system. See link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdinstall[`bsdinstall`] for more information.

If the Ports Collection is not initially installed, it can be added with link:{handbook}#ports-using[portsnap] or (if running FreeBSD {rel114-current} or {rel121-current}) or link:{handbook}#svn[Subversion] (if running FreeBSD-CURRENT).

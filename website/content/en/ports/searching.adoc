= Searching FreeBSD Ports

{{< form-ports >}}

'''''

The form above will allow you to search for ports on this site. A completed search will take you to a link:https://ports.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi[more complete search page].

However, if you already have the Ports Collection installed on your machine, you may also search by changing to the `/usr/ports` directory and performing `make search name=`__string__. Instead of by `name` you can search by port path (`path`), port information (`info`), maintainer (`maint`), port category (`cat`), build dependencies (`bdeps`), run dependencies (`rdeps`), the project web site (`www`), or any of these fields (`key`). Use `make quicksearch ...` to only display the port name, port directory, and one line description of the port.

Another option is to visit https://www.FreshPorts.org[FreshPorts.org] and either browse the site or subscribe to the lists hosted there.

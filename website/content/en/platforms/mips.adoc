== Introduction

This page contains information about porting FreeBSD to the MIPS(R) platform. Discussion of the MIPS port takes place on the https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-mips[freebsd-mips] mailing list.

== Status

MIPS is a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 2] architecture, and as such is not fully supported by the link:../../[FreeBSD] project.

== FreeBSD/MIPS Hardware Notes

FreeBSD/MIPS is a port of the FreeBSD operating system to platforms based around MIPS processors. At the moment, several MIPS32 and MIPS64 development boards and embedded platforms are being targeted.

Listing all supported devices on all CPUs and boards is impractical here, however much information can be obtained from the mailing list and archives, https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/MIPS[the FreeBSD/MIPS Wiki pages], and also from the https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/mips/conf/[Kernel Configuration files]

=== CPUs

The following non-exhaustive list of CPUs and CPU families are supported:

* MIPS4Kc
* MIPS24Kc
* MIPS74Kc
* Atheros AR71xx, AR724x, AR91xx, AR933x, AR934x
* Cavium OCTEON
* NetLogic XLR/XLS CPU family
* SRI/Cambridge's BERI and CHERI open-source FPGA soft-cores

Note that not all peripherals are supported on all CPUs.

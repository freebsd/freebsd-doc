== Status

The FreeBSD/ARM Project provides a excellent framework for building 64-bit ARM-based systems.

`FreeBSD/arm64` – for 64-bit ARMv8 processors – became a link:../../platforms/[Tier 1 platform] with FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE: 

- actively developed and maintained
- a single FreeBSD build will work on hardware from multiple vendors
- 64-bit ARM platforms follow a set of standard conventions.

Tier 2 platforms include 32-bit ARMv6 and ARMv7, which primarily target the embedded arena, and so: 

- neither official releases of the OS, nor packages of link:../../ports/[ports], are provided by link:../../[the FreeBSD Project].

`FreeBSD/armv7` includes SMP support.

`FreeBSD/arm`: 

- supports ARMv4 and ARMv5 processors with FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE and stable/12
- was deprecated with FreeBSD 13.0.

== Hardware Notes

`FreeBSD/arm` and `FreeBSD/armv6` support a wide range of CPUs and development boards.

Not every peripheral is supported on every CPU or board.
Work towards broader support is ongoing.
Contributions are welcome.

Listing all supported devices on all CPUs and boards is impractical.
Much information can be gained from: 

- the mailing list and archives
- https://wiki.freebsd.org/arm[FreeBSD ARM wiki pages]
- https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/sys/arm/conf/[kernel configuration files].

[[todo]]
== What Needs to be Done

* SATA support for some boards
* other devices, such as watchdog, i2c and bus, should be merged from NetBSD.

== Introduction

This page contains information about the FreeBSD port to the 32- and 64-bit ARM architectures and hardware. Discussion of the ARM ports takes place on the https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-arm[freebsd-arm] mailing list.

[[status]]
== Status

32-bit ARM is officially a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 2] architecture, as the link:../../[FreeBSD] project does not provide official releases or pre-built packages for this platform due to it primarily targeting the embedded arena. However, FreeBSD/ARM is being actively developed and maintained, is well supported, and provides an excellent framework for building ARM-based systems. FreeBSD/arm supports ARMv4 and ARMv5 processors. FreeBSD/armv6 supports ARMv6 and ARMv7 processors, including SMP on the latter.

Initial support for 64-bit ARM is complete. 64-bit ARM platforms follow a set of standard conventions, and a single FreeBSD build will work on hardware from multiple vendors. As a result, FreeBSD will provide official releases for FreeBSD/arm64 and packages will be available. FreeBSD/arm64 is on the path to becoming a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 1] architecture.

== FreeBSD/ARM Hardware Notes

FreeBSD/arm and FreeBSD/armv6 support a large range of ARM CPUs and development boards. Not every peripheral is supported on every CPU or board, though work continues towards this and contributions are always welcome. Conversely, many CPUs and boards not listed may work with only minimal changes needed.

Listing all supported devices on all CPUs and boards is impractical here, however much information can be obtained from the mailing list and archives, https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/arm[the FreeBSD/arm Wiki pages], and also from the https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/arm/conf/[Kernel Configuration files]

[[todo]]
== What Needs To Be Done

* SATA support needs to be added for boards currently missing it.
* Other devices, such as watchdog, i2c and bus should be merged from NetBSD.

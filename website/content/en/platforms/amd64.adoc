This page contains information of the FreeBSD port to http://www.amd.com/[AMD's] AMD64 and http://www.intel.com/info/em64t[Intel(R) 64] architecture, often also known as "x86-64" or "x64". FreeBSD/amd64 is suitable for almost all recent AMD and Intel CPUs.

The AMD64 architecture was previously known as "Hammer". The Intel 64 architecture was previously known as Yamhill, Clackamas Technology (CT), IA-32e, and EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology).

Newer AMD Sempron(TM), the AMD Opteron(TM), AMD Athlon(TM) 64, AMD Turion(TM), AMD Phenom(TM), and AMD EPYC(TM) processors, and processors with AMD Zen cores all use the AMD64 architecture.

The Intel vPro(TM), Intel Celeron D (some models since "Prescott"), Intel Centrino(R) Duo, Intel Centrino(R) Pro, Intel Viiv(TM), Intel Core(TM)2 Extreme, Intel Core(TM)2 Quad, Intel Core(TM)2 Duo, Intel Xeon (3000-sequence, 5000-sequence, and 7000-sequence), and the Intel Core(TM) i range of processors use the Intel(R) 64 architecture.

== Status

FreeBSD/amd64 runs in 64-bit multiuser mode, in both Uniprocessor and Multiprocessor mode.

The AMD64 platform is a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 1] FreeBSD platform.

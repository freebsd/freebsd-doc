= FreeBSD/i386 Project

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This page contains information about the FreeBSD/i386 platform. FreeBSD/i386 should support any CPU compatible with the Intel(T) 80486 or better in 32-bit mode, although almost every recent AMD(T) and Intel(T) CPU will also be capable of running in 64-bit mode using the link:../amd64/[FreeBSD/amd64] port.

FreeBSD/i386 supports up to 4GiB of RAM by default. Machines with more RAM will either need to run link:../amd64/[FreeBSD/amd64] or run with link:{faq}#memory-i386-over-4gb[Physical Address Extension (PAE)] enabled in order to make use of any memory above the 4GiB boundary.

== Status

FreeBSD/i386 runs in 32-bit multiuser mode, in both Uniprocessor and Multiprocessor mode.

The i386 platform is a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 1] FreeBSD platform.

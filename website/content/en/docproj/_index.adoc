= FreeBSD Documentation Project

== Overview

Getting to grips with a new and complex operating system is always a difficult task, no matter how pretty the GUI is. FreeBSD is no different in this respect.

While there are a vast number of BSD Unix (and general UNIX(R)) books available, FreeBSD has its own unique features, procedures and quirks.

In addition, FreeBSD will be the first exposure to a Unix-like operating system for some of its users, so the availability of high quality, accurate documentation is paramount.

The FreeBSD Documentation Project exists to help fill this gap. There are two ways in which this is undertaken:

. Members of the Documentation Project write documentation and submit it for inclusion in the _FreeBSD Documentation Set_.

. Members of the Documentation Project discuss and arrange the formatting and organization of the _FreeBSD Documentation Set_.

=== Current projects

There are a number of projects currently _in progress_ as part of the documentation effort. Please take the time to look over https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocIdeaList[the current list of projects] and see if there is anything *you* can help with.

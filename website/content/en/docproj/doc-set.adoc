= FreeBSD Documentation Project: Documentation Set

FreeBSD's documentation falls into three basic categories:

. https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi[*The manual pages*]
+
The manual pages are part of the base system, but are also an important component of the documentation. Both the Documentation project and source committers update and maintain manual pages.
+
At present, the Japanese team has translated many of the manual pages. Other volunteers could pitch in to translate the manual pages to other languages as well.
. link:../../docs/books/[*The Books*]
+
The project has a large amount of documentation that is "book length", or becoming that way. These include the FreeBSD FAQ and the FreeBSD Handbook.
. link:../../docs/books#ARTICLES[*The Articles*]
+
FreeBSD has a wealth of information available in shorter, article form -- similar to the tutorials or HOWTO documentation of other projects.

Note: I have not read emails or other correspondence since 11/18/2023,
and will not do so until next week, at the earliest.

My name is Glen, and I am an alcoholic.

This is my scarlet letter.

After having been severely concerned about several things in my personal
life, I tried to take a step back and regain my composure, but failed.

On 11/18/2023, I drank 3 bottles of wine with about 45 Xanax.

The intent here was quite clear.

I attempted to commit suicide.

I ended up in an insane asylum, for a bit over the past week or so.

I have recently been toxic to the Project, and cannot allow such
behavior to continue to affect the Project I love.

I need to leave.

As of this writing, gjb@ is dead.  May he rest in peace.

Please, if you or are loved one are experiencing a crisis, please use your
local or national resources to seek help on suicide prevention, substance
abuse, alcohol abuse, and mental disorders.

Glen

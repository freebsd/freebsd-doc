= Community

FreeBSD's community is diverse and extensive, and can be found everywhere that great conversations and activity takes place.
You'll find our community and spaces intelligent, welcoming and approachable.

The Project maintains official community spaces where developers, contributors and users can find help and support, stay up to date, coordinate and collaborate, or just kick back, relax and socialise.

If you prefer asynchronous and long-lived communication, we have https://lists.freebsd.org[more than one hundred mailing lists], a https://forums.freebsd.org/[forum], and Usenet link:{handbook}eresources/#eresources-news[newsgroups].

For real-time collaboration, we have https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/[IRC channels] and a https://wiki.freebsd.org/Discord[Discord instance] where you can find support, learn to contribute, watch live streams, and a whole lot more.

If you are interested in professional development and networking opportunities with LinkedIn, see our https://www.linkedin.com/company/freebsd/[company] and https://www.linkedin.com/groups/47628[group] pages.

For in-person and online meets, see our https://www.freebsd.org/events[Events] page.

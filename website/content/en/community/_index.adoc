= Community

FreeBSD's community is diverse and extensive, and can be found everywhere great conversations and activity takes place.
You'll find our community and spaces intelligent, welcoming and approachable.

The project maintains several official community spaces where developers, contributors and users can find help and support, stay up to date, coordinate and collaborate or just kick back, relax and socialise.

If you prefer asynchronous and long-lived communications channels, FreeBSD offers over one hundred https://lists.freebsd.org[mailing lists] covering a vast range of topics, and provides web-based https://forums.freebsd.org/[forums] and several Usenet link:{handbook}eresources/#eresources-news[newsgroups].

For more real-time collaboration, we have a number of https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/[FreeBSD IRC channels] and an instance on https://wiki.freebsd.org/Discord[Discord] where you can find support, learn to contribute, watch live streams and a whole lot more.

If you are interested in professional development and networking opportunities then follow us on https://www.linkedin.com/company/freebsd/[LinkedIn] and join our official https://www.linkedin.com/groups/47628[FreeBSD LinkedIn Group].

For regularly run in-person and online meets, you might like to look into our https://www.freebsd.org/events[FreeBSD Events] where we maintain a feed and calendar of upcoming events.

On Reddit, you can find the FreeBSD community link:https://www.reddit.com/r/freebsd/[here].

Beyond officially run community spaces, there are many https://www.freebsd.org/usergroups/[User Groups], along with highly active FreeBSD communities on https://twitter.com/search?q=freebsd[Twitter], https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/freebsd[StackOverflow], https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/freebsd[ServerFault], and https://www.meetup.com/topics/freebsd/[MeetUp.com], among many other technology-related spaces.

The https://wiki.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD wiki] contains information about development and related projects.

== Video Content

On YouTube, we host two official channels. On the main link:https://youtube.com/FreeBSDProject[FreeBSD channel] you'll find technical content, and on the link:https://youtube.com/@FreeBSDMeetings[FreeBSD Meetings] channel you'll find live presentations, conferences, and working group meetings.

Feel you don't belong here?
FreeBSD is a system built piece by piece by volunteers from all walks of life.
If you see something you think you can improve, we want to receive a patch, or a problem report, or a mail from you.
There is room for everyone to help, and many of us have found enormous challenge and meaning in doing so.

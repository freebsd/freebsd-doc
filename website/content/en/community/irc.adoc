= IRC

While #freebsd channels exist on various IRC networks, the FreeBSD project does not control them or endorse IRC as a support medium. You may be ignored, insulted, or kicked out if you ask questions on any channel in IRC, though you may have slightly better luck in channels named #freebsdhelp where such exist. A list of known FreeBSD related IRC channels is available in the FreeBSD https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Channels[wiki]. If you want to try these or any other channels on IRC, it is nonetheless at your own risk and any complaints about conduct on those channels should not be directed to the FreeBSD project. See also link:{faq}#irc[the FAQ entry] for more information.

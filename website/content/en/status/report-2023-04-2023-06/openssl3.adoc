Pierre has been tasked with importing OpenSSL 3 into the base system.

OpenSSL is a library for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication.
It provides an open source implementation of the SSL and TLS network protocols, which are widely used in applications such as e-mail, instant messaging, Voice over IP (VoIP), or more prominently the global Web (aka HTTPS).
Assuming that the Apache and nginx web servers use OpenSSL, their combined market share for web traffic exceeds 50%, cementing the leadership and critical importance of OpenSSL as part of the infrastructure of the Internet.

Since its initial release in August 2016, the 1.1 branch of OpenSSL has been adopted by most Linux and BSD systems, while remaining supported by the upstream maintainers through an LTS (long term support) policy.
However, official support is planned to end in the middle of September this year, and it became urgent and necessary to consider adopting its successor for LTS, the 3.0 branch.

OpenSSL has largely outgrown its ancestor SSLeay, now shipping over half a million single lines of code (SLOC) split in over two thousand files.
Perhaps as a consequence, its build system is relatively complex and normally requires Perl, which was removed from base more than twenty years ago for FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE.
Thankfully however, it was possible to import and setup OpenSSL 3.0.9 the FreeBSD way, and it is now part of the base system as planned for FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

To describe OpenSSL 3 as a major release is an understatement.
First, its problematic licensing model has finally been solved, with a complete switch to the Apache License 2.0.
Then, OpenSSL 3 introduces the concept of provider modules.
While obsolete cryptographical algorithms have been isolated to a _legacy_ module, it is also possible to restrict the implementation to the standards part of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards[FIPS] with the _fips_ module.
The latter can then benefit from a dedicated certification process, and be validated officially (like the 3.0.8 release at the time of writing).

Moreover, the updated library comes with a version bump, as applications using OpenSSL 1.1 need to be recompiled to use 3.0.
Many API functions have been deprecated and replaced with newer, more generic alternatives, however it is still possible to explicitly request older APIs and have OpenSSL 3 expose them accordingly.
This possibility has been leveraged in FreeBSD to help with the transition, where a number of libraries and applications have simply been configured to request the OpenSSL 1.1 API.
These components will be updated progressively over time in order to consume OpenSSL 3's native API instead.

While there is a known performance impact associated with the update when consuming small input block sizes, it was found to be marginal when working with blocks of 1 KB and above.
Another challenge lies with the FIPS provider module, which currently requires some manual steps in order to have it working.
We are currently looking for a solution to ship FreeBSD with a functional FIPS provider by default.

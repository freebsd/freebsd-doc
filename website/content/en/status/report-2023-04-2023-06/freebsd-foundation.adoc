The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.
Donations from individuals and corporations are used to fund and manage software development projects, conferences, and developer summits.
We also provide travel grants to FreeBSD contributors, purchase and support hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure, and provide resources to improve security, quality assurance, and release engineering efforts.
We publish marketing material to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD Project, facilitate collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD developers, and finally, represent the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require a recognized legal entity.

==== Happy 30th birthday, FreeBSD!

For more than 23 years, we have proudly backed this remarkable operating system and its vibrant community, and we eagerly anticipate supporting them for many more years.
In this update, we will outline our contributions to FreeBSD across multiple domains.
We will touch upon project development initiatives, some of which have detailed reports of their own.
Additionally, we will showcase our advocacy for FreeBSD, our efforts to foster community engagement, and our expansion of partnership endeavors.
Lastly, we will delve into our ongoing work to secure increased funding, enabling us to allocate additional resources to address any gaps within the Project.

==== Fundraising

During this quarter, we made significant progress in engaging with commercial FreeBSD users.
To enhance our partnerships with existing and potential commercial users, we hired Greg Wallace as the Director of Partnerships and Research.
His primary objective is to expand our collaborations with commercial users.
Since assuming this position, Greg has hit the ground running, meeting with numerous companies in just one quarter.
These interactions have provided valuable insights into how FreeBSD is being utilized, the challenges faced by users, and areas where the Project can improve.
By understanding these aspects, we can make informed decisions on where to allocate our funding and recognize FreeBSD's unique strengths.
Additionally, the role involves conducting research to identify target markets, explore new opportunities for FreeBSD, and ensure our voice is heard in relevant discussions.
For more details on Greg's objectives and accomplishments, you can refer to his status update below.

The Foundation extends its heartfelt gratitude to everyone who made financial contributions to support our work.
Besides many individual contributions, we were pleased to receive larger donations from NetApp and Blackberry.
In addition, we received FreeBSD Developer Summit sponsorships from Tarsnap, iXsystems, and LPI.
These sponsorships greatly assist in offsetting our expenses and enable us to offer affordable registration fees to attendees.

This year our budget is around $2,230,000, which includes increased spending toward FreeBSD advocacy and software development.
More than half of our budget is allocated toward work directly related to improving FreeBSD and keeping it secure.

By having a dedicated individual focused on partnerships, we can effectively emphasize the significance of investing in our efforts and underscore the long-term viability of the Project to companies.

Your support plays a crucial role in our mission, and we deeply appreciate your commitment to the FreeBSD community.
Please consider making a donation toward our 2023 fundraising campaign!

==== Partnership Program

Hello FreeBSD community.
My name is Greg Wallace.
I joined the Foundation as Director of Partnerships and Research in early April.
link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-foundation-welcomes-new-team-members/[This blog introduced me and the role].
For Partnerships, I am focused on building connections with companies that use FreeBSD.
I have met with several companies to learn about how they use FreeBSD.
Some of these meetings have generated discussions about potential partnership.
I continue to find out about interesting companies using FreeBSD and I am reaching out to them.

My objective is to get in touch with every company building with and using FreeBSD to listen to their stories.
If this is you and we have not yet connected, please schedule a call on link:https://calendly.com/greg-freebsdfound/30min[my calendar].

Some other partnership-related activities this quarter:

* I created link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tDCpbfxbqIucmJF6H15vK-ETrQsCMOVtxoqLem_V0Z0/edit?usp=sharing[these slides] about how partnering with the Foundation helps advance FreeBSD.
  If you have ideas for how I can improve these slides, or would like me to present them to your organization, please mailto:greg@freebsdfoundation.org[send me an email], or link:https://calendly.com/greg-freebsdfound/30min[schedule a call].
  And please feel free to share the presentation liberally, in whole or in part.
* I worked with my Foundation colleagues to create a number of industry-specific use case slides for a presentation to an industry analyst.
* I am also pursuing grant opportunities with bodies including:
** NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
** Sovereign Tech Fund
** NGI.

In terms of research, my broad aim is to make sure that all of the expertise in this community is reflected in the global conversations on computing performance, security, and energy efficiency.
As a community, we have much to bring to this work.

So far, I have been tracking and plugging into the following threads:

* link:https://openforumeurope.org/open-source/[Open Forum Europe]
* link:https://www.nist.gov/chips/research-and-development-program[CHIPS Research and Development].

If you have research ideas or are interested in working together in this area, please mailto:greg@freebsdfoundation.org[send me an email], or link:https://calendly.com/greg-freebsdfound/30min[schedule a call].

==== Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance

The Foundation provides a full-time staff member and funds projects to improve continuous integration, automated testing, and overall quality assurance efforts for the FreeBSD project.
You can read more about CI work in a dedicated report entry.

==== Advocacy

Much of our effort is dedicated to the FreeBSD Project advocacy.
This may involve highlighting interesting FreeBSD work, producing literature and video tutorials, attending events, or giving presentations.
The goal of the literature we produce is to teach people FreeBSD basics and help make their path to adoption or contribution easier.
Other than attending and presenting at events, we encourage and help community members run their own FreeBSD events, give presentations, or staff FreeBSD tables.

The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and summits around the globe.
These events can be BSD-related, open source, or technology events geared towards underrepresented groups.
We support the FreeBSD-focused events to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, working together on projects, and facilitating collaboration between developers and commercial users.
This all helps provide a healthy ecosystem.
We support the non-FreeBSD events to promote and raise awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in different applications, and to recruit more contributors to the Project.
We are grateful to be back to attending events mostly in person.
In addition to attending and planning events, we are continually working on new training initiatives and updating our selection of link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/freebsd-project/resources/[how-to guides] to facilitate getting more folks to try out FreeBSD.

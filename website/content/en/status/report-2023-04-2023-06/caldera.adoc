MITRE Caldera is a cybersecurity platform designed to easily automate adversary emulation, assist manual red teams, and automate incident response.

It is built on the MITRE ATT&CK(R) framework and is an active research project at MITRE.

MITRE Caldera (package:security/caldera[]) was added to the ports tree in April 2023.
This port includes support for the link:https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team[Atomic Red Team Project] used by the link:https://github.com/mitre/atomic[MITRE Caldera atomic plugin].

The main goal of this work is enhancing visibility of FreeBSD as a useful platform for information security or cybersecurity.

Additionally, you can test a MITRE Caldera infrastructure easily using link:https://github.com/alonsobsd/caldera-makejail[] or link:https://github.com/AppJail-makejails/caldera[] from link:https://github.com/DtxdF/AppJail[AppJail].
AppJail is a good tool for managing jail containers from the command line.

People interested in helping with the project are welcome.

Current version: 4.2.0

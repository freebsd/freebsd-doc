The KDE on FreeBSD project packages CMake, Qt, and software from the KDE Community, for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@, building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver graphical desktop workstation.
The notes below describe *mostly* ports for KDE, but also include items that are important for the entire desktop stack.

==== Infrastructure

Qt5 ports had various updates:

* package:devel/qt5-webengine[] was repaired when building with Clang 16.
This is in preparation for the upcoming release of FreeBSD 14.
* package:devel/qt5-qmake[] was repaired to deal with an edge case where installing qmake on an otherwise Qt-less system would cause weird errors.

Qt6 ports had various updates:

* package:devel/qt6-tools[] was repaired when building with Clang 16.
This is preparation for the upcoming release of FreeBSD 14.

The package:accessibility/at-spi2-core[] port -- essential for accessible technologies on the desktop -- was updated to release 2.48.0.

The package:accessibility/at-spi2-core[] port now has better support for non-X11 desktops.
This is an improvement for Wayland-based systems.
Thanks to Jan Beich for landing that.

The package:graphics/poppler[] port -- a base for many PDF viewers -- was updated to 23.05.

The package:ports-mgmt/packagekit-qt[] port is a new addition to the tree to pave the way for graphical package managers on FreeBSD.

==== KDE Stack

KDE Gear releases happen every quarter, KDE Plasma updates once a month, and KDE Frameworks have a new release every month as well.
These (large) updates land shortly after their upstream release and are not listed separately.

* KDE Frameworks updated to 5.105, .106 and .107.
* KDE Gear updated to 23.04.0, then .1 and .2 with bugfixes.
* KDE Plasma Desktop was updated to version 5.27.4, then .5 and .6 with bugfixes.

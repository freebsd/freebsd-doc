Here is the second 2023 status report, with 37 entries.

As you might notice, we have several more reports than last quarter.
This is a great news and shows how much the FreeBSD community is active and always working on providing high quality software.

In particular, please note that Summer has started and do not miss the amazing projects shared by our Google Summer of Code students.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

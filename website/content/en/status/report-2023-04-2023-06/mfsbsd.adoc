==== What is mfsBSD?

"mfsBSD is a toolset to create small-sized but full-featured mfsroot based distributions of FreeBSD that store all files in memory (MFS) [Memory File System] and load from hard drive, usb storage device or optical media.
It can be used for a variety of purposes, including diskless systems, recovery partitions and remotely overwriting other operating systems."

==== Purpose

This project creates an additional target of the weekly snapshots of -current and -stable versions of mfsBSD images in the src/release makefile.
Currently, only the release versions of mfsBSD images are produced, which means they tend to get out of sync with the tools in base.
This project aims to address that problem.

==== Location

This is a GSoC 2023 (Google Summer of Code) project.
As such, the official coding period is between May 29, 2023 and August 28, 2023.
As a humble beginner in the open-source community, the author welcomes all comments / suggestions / pull requests in the project repository, which will be the location for all code throughout this period.

Mentors: mailto:otis@FreeBSD.org[Juraj Lutter] and mailto:jrm@FreeBSD.org[Joseph Mingone]

FreeBSD project uses LLVM as its toolchain.
The LLVM  project has bundled with a debugger called LLDB.
In LLDB, the userspace debugging facilities has been well implemented.
However, in the kernel space, there are still some works have to be done.
One of the work is the kernel module debug facility for LLDB - that is, parse the loaded module data provided by the kernel core dump and loading the module objects.
The goal is to implement such plugin for LLDB, and this is an ongoing GSoC Project for now.

https://github.com/aokblast/freebsd-src/tree/lldb_dynamicloader_freebsd_kernel[Project Codebase] is the whole code of my work.

Currently, this is still a work in progress and I am still debugging on it.

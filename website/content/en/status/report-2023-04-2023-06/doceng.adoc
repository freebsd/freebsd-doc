The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project; for more information, see the link:https://www.freebsd.org/internal/doceng/[FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter].

During this quarter:

* fernape@ has been appointed as a new Doceng team member.
* The package:www/gohugo[] port maintainership has been transferred to doceng@ since it is a critical part of our documentation infrastructure.
This was agreed with the former maintainer.
* Improvements to the translation workflow (described in the following sections).

==== FDP Primer

A new chapter focusing on Weblate has been added to the link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/fdp-primer/weblate/[FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer for New Contributors].
This comprehensive chapter provides step-by-step guidance on joining the FreeBSD translators team, both for translating online on Weblate and offline.
It offers valuable insights and practical suggestions for efficient translation, proofreading, and testing processes.
Furthermore, this chapter equips contributors with the necessary knowledge to formally submit their translations to the documentation repository, ensuring a seamless integration of their work.

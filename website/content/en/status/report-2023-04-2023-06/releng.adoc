The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the second quarter of 2023, the Team continued work on 13.2-RELEASE.
The 13.2 cycle had closely followed the set schedule, with the addition of three additional RC builds at the end, and the final RELEASE build and announcement in mid-April.

In coordination with various teams within the Project management, the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team reconsidered the original schedule for the upcoming 14.0-RELEASE, primarily due to work that was in progress.
The updated schedule was discussed and adjusted slightly to account for some concerns, and ultimately published on the FreeBSD Project website.
The new schedule targets 14.0-RELEASE for October, 2023.

The Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the `main`, `stable/13`, and `stable/12` branches.
Note, there will no longer be snapshot builds against `stable/12` moving forward.

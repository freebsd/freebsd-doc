At the end of 2024 Future Crew LLC provided the source for their iwx port from OpenBSD.
I opted to merge the two drivers together using the Future Crew driver as a base and importing my modifications.

I worked on this driver, tidying up and removing a lot of development code and expanding support for more devices.
iwx in FreeBSD should now attach to any device supported by OpenBSD.
Firmware is available thanks to mailto:bz@FreeBSD.org[bz@] in the package:net/wifi-firmware-iwlwifi-kmod[] package.

iwx landed in FreeBSD on the final day of the quarter.
iwx probes with a lower priority than iwlwifi to avoid breaking deployed configurations.

iwx supports legacy, HT and VHT rates and some users have reported significant throughputs in test.
There remain many issues around rate selection and development is continuing.

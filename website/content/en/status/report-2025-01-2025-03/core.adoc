The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

==== Project roadmap

Core is collecting ideas and comments to draft Project's roadmap.
It is an item core.13 thinks is worth to continue from core.12.
The roadmap is not about restricting or limiting what developers and contributors can do, but about the compiled goals and expectations of the Project and things the community can collaborate on.
It will also let the FreeBSD Foundation help the Project more effectively, so, this is an important discussion item for the meetings between core and the FreeBSD Foundation.

==== Work in Progress

Core is currently working on the following items:

* Policy on generative AI created code and documentation
* Core and the FreeBSD Foundation are working on the 2025 edition of the Community survey
* Privacy-friendly web analytics, proposed by the Foundation

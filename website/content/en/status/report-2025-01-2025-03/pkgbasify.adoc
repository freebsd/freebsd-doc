The new link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify[pkgbasify] tool automatically converts an existing FreeBSD 14+ system to use link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/PkgBase[pkgbase].

I've done my best to make pkgbasify as robust as possible and currently believe it to be as reliable as manual conversion if not better.

That said, pkgbasify could use testing on more diverse systems!
See the link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify[README] for usage instructions and details on pkgbasify's behavior.

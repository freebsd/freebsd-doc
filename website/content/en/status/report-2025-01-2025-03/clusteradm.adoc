Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing the machines the Project relies on to synchronize its distributed work and communications.

In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

* Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts.
* Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical hosts and mirrors.
* Cluster software refresh.
* Moving more cluster services to Chicago.
* Supporting the Grimoirelab dashboard effort.
* Coordinate community mirrors.

==== Moving cluster services to Chicago

We started building up our new site in Chicago 2024, with a long-term goal to have Chicago as our primary location.
Since 2024Q4, we began decommissioning older machines in New Jersey and moving services to the newer machines in Chicago.
In 2025Q1, we started upgrading critical services in the cluster and testing to setup in Chicago.

==== Git web interface mirrors

While the project's public read-only git repository is built by a globally distributed mirror, the web interface (cgit) is not.
We found there is increasing requirement of accessing it, and for improving the response time and reliability, we setup the cgit on the mirrors around the world.

==== FreeBSD official mirrors

Current locations are Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan (two full mirror sites), Malaysia, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom (full mirror site), United States of America -- California, Chicago, New Jersey (primary site), and Washington.

Our mirror site in Taiwan is experiencing an extended outage.
The effort of bringing it back is in progress.
We hope to have it back online during the second quarter of 2025.

New official mirrors are always welcome.
We have noted the benefits of hosting single mirrors at Internet Exchange Points globally, as evidenced by our existing mirrors in Australia, Brazil, and South Africa.
If you are affiliated with or know of any organizations willing to sponsor a single mirror server, please contact us.
We are particularly interested in locations on the United States West Coast and throughout Europe.

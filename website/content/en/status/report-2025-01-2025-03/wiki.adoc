The wiki team needs new blood.

Since the last status report (2024Q3) forward progress has stalled.
We have given out several dozen new accounts but most of the changes by these new authors have been to individual pages, not to the overall structure.

Mark Linimon still thinks the wiki could be a great resource if people were willing to put time into it.
But right now, there are more complaints about stale data than there are new contributors and new ideas.

It is fair to say that right now, the wiki is on autopilot.

==== Previous plans that have stalled

Preliminary work was being done on updating the wiki software itself.
Earlier, we were looking at switching implementations because MoinMoin development seemed to have stalled, leaving us with an unwanted hanging python2 dependency.
However, MoinMoin now claims that they are nearing a 2.0 release.
We have not yet tried an install of their latest beta version to test compatibility.

==== Specific short-term requests for help

If anyone knows about MoinMoin markup, contact Mark.

The FreeBSD Laptop and Desktop Workgroup (LDWG) has continued its dedicated efforts throughout the first quarter.

LDWG holds monthly meetings to discuss the state of FreeBSD on laptops and desktops and to review progress.
These meetings are scheduled every second Monday at 5 PM UTC.
The next meeting is set for Wednesday, May 14, at 10 AM PST / 1 PM EDT / 5 PM UTC.

A survey has been initiated to explore alternative calling options that would enable participants from APAC regions to join the calls more conveniently.

All calls are now available on YouTube, allowing broader access for interested parties to stay updated on the group's activities.

The group's participants have made notable advancements in several areas:

* ***Audio Improvements:*** Enhancements have been made to improve audio quality.
* ***Documentation:*** Significant improvements have been made to the documentation, making it more comprehensive and user-friendly.
* ***Wireless Speed and Stability:*** Efforts have led to better wireless speed and stability, enhancing overall connectivity.

All activities are meticulously documented on the group's worksheet.
LDWG encourages anyone interested in contributing to add their name to the worksheet.
If there is any planned or ongoing work, participants are welcome to include it in the worksheet.

The established LDWG's call agenda includes:

* ***News Updates:*** Sharing news around FreeBSD on desktops and laptops, including work not otherwise covered by the workgroup.
* ***FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Project:*** The project continues to progress well, with reports highlighting the need for volunteers to support testing efforts and the formation of a UX test group.
* ***Project Reviews and Announcements:*** Reviewing and presenting progress, announcing new projects, and calling for actions.
* ***Q&A Sessions:*** Providing a platform to ask questions about ongoing projects; serving as a rallying point to organize developers, users, and stakeholders on focus areas.

LDWG is working to improve the call's agenda in collaboration with the Enterprise Working Group.
Both groups face the challenge of having more areas of interest and work streams than available resources.
Therefore, a process is being developed to ensure that available time is spent on matters that have the required resources and attention.

The group is open to anyone interested in the matter.
We welcome anyone who wants to join the group and/or calls to do so.

Hope to see you there!

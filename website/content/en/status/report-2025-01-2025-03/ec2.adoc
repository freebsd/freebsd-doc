FreeBSD is available on both amd64 (Intel and AMD) and arm64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.

In the past quarter, considerable effort has gone into making "hot unplug" (e.g. detaching EBS volumes) work correctly, with several different fixes required on different instance types.
This is expected to be fully functional in the upcoming FreeBSD 14.3.

This work fixes FIB handling on FreeBSD when an interface is destroyed.

I encountered this issue on one of our OpenBGPd-enabled FreeBSD servers, where destroying an interface caused all our BGP sessions to drop due to a crash in OpenBGPd.

I decided to debug the issue and fix the problem; the results can be found in this link:https://github.com/openbgpd-portable/openbgpd-portable/pull/93[GitHub pull request].

Now, we can safely create or destroy virtual or cloned interfaces alongside OpenBGPd without worrying about our BGP sessions.

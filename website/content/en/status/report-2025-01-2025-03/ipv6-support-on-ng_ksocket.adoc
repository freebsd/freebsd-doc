Support for IPv6 has been added to the man:ng_ksocket[4] module.

The `ng_ksocket` node type allows users to open a socket inside the kernel and have it appear as a `netgraph` node.
While attempting to export traffic flow using man:ng_netflow[4], I recognized the need for IPv6 implementation within the `ng_ksocket` module.

There was a previous attempt to add IPv6 support to the `ng_ksocket` module (see Phabricator review link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D23788[D23788]).

After looking into those changes, I decided to complete the efforts and also add validation to comply with standards.

The result is now available as an link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48204[updated review on Phabricator].

Now, we can create IPv6 sockets using the ksocket module directly within the `netgraph` framework.
After my changes, I was able to export my traffic flows directly using `netgraph` without the need to enable IPv4 on my network links.

**AppJail** is an open-source BSD-3 licensed framework entirely written in POSIX shell and C to create isolated, portable and easy to deploy environments using FreeBSD jails that behaves like an application.

**Director** is a tool for running multi-jail environments on AppJail using a simple YAML specification.
A Director file is used to define how one or more jails that make up your application are configured.
Once you have a Director file, you can create and start your application with a single command: `appjail-director up`.

**Overlord** is a fast, distributed orchestrator for FreeBSD jails oriented to GitOps.
You define a file with the service intended to run on your cluster and deployment takes seconds to minutes.
This orchestration tool uses AppJail, Director and can even create VMs with vm-bhyve, but as its philosophy is "deploy using code" you can create a single file once and deploy many times.
Through a tree chaining system Overlord deploys jails on connected systems sharing their resources almost infinitely.

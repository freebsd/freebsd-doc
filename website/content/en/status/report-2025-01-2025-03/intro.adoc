Here is the first 2025 status report, with 40 entries.

As we step into a new year, the FreeBSD community continues its work with unwavering speed, intent, and purpose.

The first quarter has been remarkable, with numerous reports highlighting progress across various areas.
Engaging with the community through forums, mailing lists, and conversations has revealed to me more advancements than can ever be captured in a single quarterly report.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who submitted reports and helped raise awareness of our activities.
Your contributions are invaluable in showcasing our collective efforts.

Let us build on the success of 2024 and make this the best year yet for FreeBSD and our community!

Chris Moerz, on behalf of the Status Team.

Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].
Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

During this quarter, there was a new link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/releases/tag/0.16.1[Pot release 0.16.1] which includes a number of minor fixes. The FreeBSD port was updated accordingly.

Potluck got a new link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/onlyoffice-documentserver[OnlyOffice Documentserver] image that can be used together with the link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/nextcloud-nginx-nomad[Nextcloud] image.
Additionally, a large number of images have received improvements and bug fixes again, e.g. link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/nextcloud-spreed-signalling[Nextcloud Spreed], link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/grafana[Grafana], link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/vault[Vault] or link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/consul[Consul] and all images have been rebuilt for an updated base image.

Last not least, we are in the process of moving the main repository to Codeberg with Github acting as a mirror.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

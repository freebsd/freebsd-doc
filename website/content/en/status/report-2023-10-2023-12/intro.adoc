Here is the fourth 2023 status report, with 18 entries.

This is the last 2023 quarter.
As you have probably noticed, this status report comes later than usual and with fewer reports than the preceding quarter.
Indeed, please keep in mind that the last quarter of every year is for many members of our community the quarter of the celebrations for Christmas and for the New Year, which implies that those members will spend more time with their families and will have less time for their favorite voluntary software projects.
Thus there is less to report and reports tend to arrive later.
But finally, here they are.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

Plans are underway to familiarize our audience on Discord with the wiki (there are too many "silos" in our FreeBSD community).
Contact Setesh on the FreeBSD Discord for more information.

Preliminary work is being done on updating the wiki software itself.
Continuing to run MoinMoin requires a jail with a downrev version of Python.
The MoinMoin project itself seems to have stalled in the middle of a redesign; at a minimum, a complete upgrade of the backend database would be needed.

Alternatives that are under consideration include MediaWiki and DocuWiki; see link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Wiki/NextGeneration[].
Most of the discussion is occurring on Matrix; please contact wiki-admin@FreeBSD.org if you would like to participate.

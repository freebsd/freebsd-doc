This report provides a continued overview of the FreeBSD online editor and man page editor project, outlining recent efforts to enhance the documentation and manual page editing processes.
In order to optimize the project's structural integrity, we enlisted the expertise of a professional front-end programmer.
We plan to release the editor soon and currently have some tasks that require additional support.

1. We are actively seeking a qualified individual to conduct a comprehensive front-end security review of the project.

2. A meticulous inspection of the JavaScript code is imperative to ensure its robustness and efficiency.
We are looking for someone with expertise to thoroughly examine the codebase, identify any issues, and propose enhancements for optimal performance.

3. Since there is currently no existing JavaScript library for rendering mandoc, I had to create my own.
However, there are still some hidden errors that emerge during the editing process.
We are seeking assistance to fix these rendering issues.

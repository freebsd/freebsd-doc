FreeBSD is available on both amd64 (Intel and AMD) and arm64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.
Work continues to ensure that upcoming instance types will be supported; most recently, changes were needed to support "7th generation" Intel and AMD instances.

FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE shipped with experimental ZFS-root AMIs and "cloud-init" AMIs.
Additional "flavored" FreeBSD AMIs are planned, including "AMI Builder" and "minimal" (no debug symbols).

A bug in the release-building process which resulted in 14.0-RELEASE AMIs shipping with duplicate lines in /etc/rc.conf has been corrected and future releases should not be affected.

A bug in the ec2-aws-imdsv2-get utility which resulted in 14.0-RELEASE AMIs not supporting binary user-data files has been corrected and future releases should not be affected.

This work is supported by Colin's FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon.

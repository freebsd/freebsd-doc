Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During this quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/285[Pot 0.16.0] was released containing link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[a number of features and fixes], including link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/283[a new setting to prevent direct traffic between VNET pots] and link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/275[new attributes] to configure pot stop behavior.
There were also maintenance/stability releases to link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potnet/pull/56[potnet (0.5.0)] and a link:https://github.com/bsdpot/nomad-pot-driver/pull/52[nomad-pot-driver (0.10.0)].

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

One of the new container images that have been added during the last quarter is link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/zincsearch[Zincsearch], a more light-weight alternative to Elasticsearch written in Go.

The link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/mastodon-s3[Mastodon container] is meanwhile powering the public link:https://mastodon.africa[mastodon.africa] instance.

Also, we got some more publicity: link:https://www.bsdnow.tv/536[BSD Now Episode 536] is titled "Pot-flavored Jails".

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

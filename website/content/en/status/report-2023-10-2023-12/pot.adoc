Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During this quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/274[XXXPot 0.15.7] was released with link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[XXXa number of changes] like link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/283[adding a setting to prevent direct traffic between VNET pots].

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

One of the new container images that have been added during the last quarter is link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/zincsearch[Zincsearch], a more light-weight alternative to Elasticsearch written in Go. 

The link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/mastodon-s3[Mastodon container] is meanwhile powering the public link:https://mastodon.africa[mastodon.africa] instance.

Also, we got some more publicity: link:https://www.bsdnow.tv/536[BSD Now Episode 536] is titled "Pot-flavored Jails".

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

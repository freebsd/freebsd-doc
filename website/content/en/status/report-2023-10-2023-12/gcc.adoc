Thanks to mailto:antoine@FreeBSD.org[Antoine Brodin] who ran the exp-runs and to all other developers and ports maintainers involved.

As you might remember from last quarter, additional patches were tested together with the default version updates.
Some of them have already been merged:

* package:lang/gcc11[] has switched back to STANDARD_BOOTSTRAP and has been updated to 11.4.0;
* package:lang/gcc13[] has been updated to version 13.2.0.

About half of the open bugs have been fixed, but another half remains.
If you maintain any of the affected ports, please try to fix your port(s) and/or get your port buildable with the compiler in base.

This quarter many bug reports have also been opened about GCC.
As soon as the default GCC version update is finished, all of those bugs will be addressed.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the fourth quarter of the year, the Team continued work on 14.0-RELEASE, leading to the final RELEASE build and announcement in November.
Planning has started for the upcoming 13.3-RELEASE and 14.1-RELEASE cycles.

The Release Engineering Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the *main* and *stable/13* branches, and (after 14.0-RELEASE) started weekly builds for *stable/14*.

After over a decade as Release Engineering Lead, Glen Barber has retired from the role; his Deputy, Colin Percival, has moved into the Lead role, while Mike Karels has assumed the position of Deputy Release Engineer.

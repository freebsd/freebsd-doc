In todays message the following by no means complete or ordered set of improvements and additions will be covered:</p><p>i386 PAE Pagetables for up to 24GB memory support, Continuous Integration efforts, driver updates to ENA and graphics, ARM enhancements such as RochChip, Marvell 8K, and Broadcom support as well as more DTS files, more Capsicum possibilities, as well as pfsync improvements, and many more things that you can read about for yourselves.</p><p>Additionally, we bring news from some islands further down stream, namely the nosh project, HardenedBSD, ClonOS, and the Polish BSD User-Group.</p><p>We would, selfishly, encourage those of you who give us the good word to please send in your submissions sooner than just before the deadline, and also encourage anyone willing to share the good word to please read the section on which submissions we're also interested in having.</p><p>Yours hopefully,<br clear="none" />

      <p>The FreeBSD CI team maintains continuous integration
	system and related tasks
	for the FreeBSD project. The CI system regularly checks
	the changes committed
	to the project's Subversion repository can be successfully
	built, and performs
	various tests and analysis over the results. The results
	from build jobs are
	archived in artifact server, for the further testing and
	debugging needs.</p>

      <p>The members on the CI team examine the failing builds and
	unstable tests, and
	work with the experts in that area to fix the code or
	build and test
	infrastructure, to improve the software quality of the
	FreeBSD base system.
	The CI team member and the FreeBSD foundation staff Li-Wen
	is the maintainer of
	Jenkins and Jenkins related ports.</p>

      <p>In this quarter, we worked on extending test executing
	environment to improve
	the coverage, temporarily disabling flakey test cases (and
	opening tickets to
	work with domain experts). Please see freebsd-testing@
	related tickets for
	more information.</p>

      <p>In addition to that, starting from this quarter, we also
	work on collaboration
	with external projects to extend their CI to cover
	FreeBSD. See "HostedCI"
	wiki page for more information.</p>

      <p>Work in progress:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Fixing the failing test cases and builds</li>

	<li>Adding drm ports building test against -CURRENT</li>

	<li>Adding tests for selected project branches, e.g.:
	clang800-import</li>

	<li>Implementing automatic tests on bare metal hardware</li>

	<li>Planning the embedded testbed</li>

	<li>Planning running ztest and network stack tests</li>

	</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
	organization dedicated to supporting and promoting
	the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.
	Funding comes from individual and corporate
	donations and is used to fund and manage software
	development projects, conferences and developer
	summits, and provide travel grants to FreeBSD
	contributors. The Foundation purchases and
	supports hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD
	infrastructure and provides resources to improve
	security, quality assurance, and release
	engineering efforts; publishes marketing material
	to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD
	Project; facilitates collaboration between
	commercial vendors and FreeBSD developers; and
	finally, represents the FreeBSD Project in
	executing contracts, license agreements, and other
	legal arrangements that require a recognized legal
	entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD
	last quarter:</p>

      <p>Partnerships and Commercial User Support</p>

      <p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we don&#8217;t directly support
	commercial users, but we do work with them to
	understand their needs and help facilitate
	collaboration with the community. Last quarter, we
	were able to meet with a number of FreeBSD users
	and supporters at the October FreeBSD Developer
	Summit and MeetBSD conference in addition to our
	regular company meetings. These in-person meetings
	provide the opportunity to discuss pain points,
	identify how they can contribute back to FreeBSD,
	talk about what technologies they would like to
	see supported, and what can be done to support
	FreeBSD over more of their technologies and
	products.</p>

      <p>Fundraising Efforts</p>

      <p>By end of last year, we raised over $1.3M and were able to
	add Juniper, Netflix and Facebook and
	Handshake.org to our list of Foundation Partners.
	You can view the entire list here <a href="https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donors/" shape="rect">https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donors/</a>.
	We are still finalizing total donations, and will
	report the final numbers in early February. Thank
	you to everyone who supported our efforts in 2018.</p>

      <p>OS Improvements</p>

      <p>In the fourth quarter of 2018 six authors made a total of
	315 commits to the FreeBSD development tree that were
	identified as being sponsored by the FreeBSD
	Foundation. These included staff members
	Konstantin Belousov, Glen Barber, Li-Wen Hsu and
	Ed Maste, and grant recipients Mateusz Guzik and
	Mark Johnston.</p>

      <p>Mateusz' work over the quarter consisted of identifying
	and fixing bottlenecks in the FreeBSD kernel and
	system libraries. The FreeBSD base system build,
	and ports built via Poudriere, were used as
	motivating cases.</p>

      <p>Mark added an in-kernel Intel CPU microcode loader. This
	simplifies and increases the robustness of
	microcode updates, which is increasingly important
	as mitigations for speculative execution
	vulnerabilities are delivered in microcode.</p>

      <p>Mark also fixed a number of issues relating to capsicum
	support in base system utilities, implemented a
	number of NUMA enhancements and bug fixes, and
	fixed a number of high profile kernel bugs.</p>

      <p>Ed committed a large number of tool chain fixes to LLVM's
	lld linker and ELF Tool Chain components.</p>

      <p>Along with several FreeBSD developers Ed worked on the
	OpenSSL 1.1.1 import in preparation for FreeBSD
	12.0, including incorporating OpenSSH and ntp
	changes for compatibility. Ed also added
	build-time knobs for to enable userland retpoline
	and to enable BIND_NOW which
	can be used as part of a vulnerability mitigation
	strategy.</p>

      <p>Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member who is
	working on improving our automated testing,
	continuous integration, and overall quality
	assurance efforts.</p>

      <p>During the fourth quarter of 2018, Foundation employee
	Li-Wen Hsu continuously worked on improving the
	project's CI infrastructure, examining the failing
	build and test cases, and work with other teams in
	the project for their testing needs. In this
	period, we also worked on collaboration with
	external projects to improve their CI on FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for more
	information.</p>

      <p>Release Engineering</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member to lead
	the release engineering efforts. This has provided
	timely and reliable releases over the last five
	years. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Glen
	Barber led the the FreeBSD Release Engineering
	team in continuing working on the 12.0-RELEASE
	with the official announcement sent December 11.</p>

      <p>See the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team section of this
	report for more
	information.</p>

      <p>Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve
	the FreeBSD infrastructure. Last quarter, we
	continued supporting FreeBSD hardware located
	around the world.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD Advocacy and Education</p>

      <p>A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating
	for the Project. This includes promoting work
	being done by others with FreeBSD; producing
	advocacy literature to teach people about FreeBSD
	and help make the path to starting using FreeBSD
	or contributing to the Project easier; and
	attending and getting other FreeBSD contributors
	to volunteer to run FreeBSD events, staff FreeBSD
	tables, and give FreeBSD presentations.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events,
	and summits around the globe. These events can be
	BSD-related, open source, or technology events
	geared towards underrepresented groups. We support
	the FreeBSD-focused events to help provide a venue
	for sharing knowledge, to work together on
	projects, and to facilitate collaboration between
	developers and commercial users. This all helps
	provide a healthy ecosystem. We support the
	non-FreeBSD events to promote and raise awareness
	of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in
	different applications, and to recruit more
	contributors to the Project.</p>

      <p>Some of the advocacy and education work we did last
	quarter includes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Organized, sponsored, and presented at the October 2018
	FreeBSD Developers Summit in Santa Clara, CA</li>

	<li>Sponsored and exhibited at MeetBSD 2018 in Santa Clara, CA</li>

	<li>Exhibited for the first time at All Things Open in
	Raleigh, NC</li>

	<li>Exhibited and sponsored as an Industry Partner at LISA&#8217; 18
	in Nashville, TN</li>

	<li>Sponsored USENIX OSDI &#8216;18 in Carlsbad, CA as an Industry
	Partner</li>

	<li>Held an Intro to FreeBSD workshop and a &#8220;Why You Should
	Contribute to FreeBSD&#8221; talk at the Rocky Mountain
	Celebration of Women in Computing in Lakewood,
	Colorado</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	We continued producing FreeBSD advocacy material to help
	people promote FreeBSD around the world.</p>

	</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD X11/Graphics team maintains the lower levels
	of the FreeBSD graphics
	stack.
	This includes graphics drivers, graphics libraries such as
	the
	MESA OpenGL implementation, the X.org xserver with related
	libraries and
	applications, and Wayland with related libraries and
	applications.</p>

      <p>In the forth quarter, the team focused on stablizing the
	graphics drivers and
	ports for the FreeBSD 12.0 release.
	The graphics drivers have been updated with new versions
	for both FreeBSD 11.2
	and FreeBSD 12.0.
	The ports have been renamed in order to make it clearer
	which version of a port
	runs on which version on FreeBSD.
	We also created a new meta port,
	<tt>graphics/drm-kmod</tt>, which will install the
	correct driver based on FreeBSD version and architecture.
	Moving forward this is the recommended way to install the
	FreeBSD graphics
	drivers.</p>

      <p>The DRM drivers themselves are named
	<tt>graphics/drm-current-kmod</tt> and
	<tt>graphics/drm-fbsd12.0-kmod</tt> for CURRENT and 12.0
	respectively, both of which
	have been updated to use the 4.16 Linux Kernel source.
	For FreeBSD 11.2 we have
	<tt>graphics/drm-fbsd11.2-kmod</tt> which uses the
	4.11 Linux
	Kernel source.
	Finally, we created <tt>graphics/drm-legacy-kmod</tt>,
	which works on FreeBSD 12.0 and
	CURRENT.
	This is a copy of the legacy drivers from the FreeBSD base
	system.
	This work will make it possible for us to remove the drm2
	code from CURRENT,
	something we are planning to do in early February.
	A remnant of the drm2 code will remain in the base after
	this due to an
	unresolved dependency for the NVIDIA Tegra ARM chip.
	Plans for its migration are expected to be finalized in
	first quarter in 2019.</p>

      <p>Support for i386 and PowerPC 64 has been added to the drm
	kernel drivers.
	This is currently in an alpha state.</p>

      <p>Wayland has been enabled by default in the ports tree,
	meaning that all packages
	are build with Wayland support enabled.
	This makes it much easier to use and test Wayland.</p>

      <p>Support for VMware graphics pass through has been added to
	the kernel driver.
	Support for this is still missing in
	<tt>graphcs/mesa-dri</tt> though, so it currently
	does not work out of the box.</p>

      <p>The input stack has been updated and is now for the most
	part current with
	upstream.
	Evdev headers were split off from
	<tt>multimedia/v4l_compat</tt> into their own
	port,
	<tt>devel/evdev-proto</tt>.
	This makes it easier to update those headers and keep them
	current with
	upstream, as needed.
	The input stack is still an area where more work needs to
	be done to make it
	easier to use various input devices with X and Wayland on
	FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Several meetings has been held over the course of the
	period.
	Meeting notes have been sent out to the public
	<tt>x11@FreeBSD.org</tt> mailing list.</p>

      <p>People who are interested in helping out can find us on
	the x11@FreeBSD.org

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for
	setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project
	releases
	of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>During the fourth quarter of 2018, the FreeBSD Release
	Engineering team
	continued working on the 12.0-RELEASE. The
	<tt>stable/12</tt> branch was created
	on October 19, with the first BETA build being started
	shortly after. The
	release cycle slipped slightly with the addition of
	12.0-BETA4, after which
	the <tt>releng/12.0</tt> branch was created on November
	16.</p>

      <p>The remainder of the release cycle continued relatively
	smoothly for the
	duration of the release candidate (RC) phase, with the
	final release builds
	starting December 7, and the official announcement sent
	December 11.</p>

      <p>Throughout the quarter, several development snapshots
	builds were released
	for the <tt>head</tt> and <tt>stable/11</tt> branches.</p>

      <p>Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.</p>

      <p>The number of ports in the last quarter shrunk a bit to
	32,900. At the end of
	the quarter there were 2365 open port PRs of which a small
	500 were unassigned.
	The last quarter saw 7333 commits from 174 committers.
	This means that more
	port PRs were resolved than last quarter and the number of
	commits remained
	approximately the same.</p>

      <p>During the last quarter, we welcomed Alexandre C.
	Guimarães (rigoletto@) and
	Vinícius Zavam (egypcio@). The port commit bits of Alberto
	Villa (avilla@),
	Lars Thegler (lth@), Dryice Dong Liu (dryice@), Ion-Mihai
	Tetcu (itetcu@),
	Gabor Pali (pgj@), Tom Judge (tj@), Ollivier Robert
	(roberto@), and Maxim
	Sobolev (sobomax@) were taken in for safekeeping.</p>

      <p>The number of commit bits safekept is higher than usual
	because for port commit
	bits the idle timeout changed from 18 months to 12 months.</p>

      <p>Some default versions were changed:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>PHP from 7.1 to 7.2</li>

	<li>Perl5 from 5.26 to 5.28</li>

	<li>Ruby from 2.4 to 2.5</li>

	<li>For LLVM, version 7.0 is now supported as a default
	version.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Other big changes are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>info files are stored in the share/info directory just as
	other
	operating systems do.</li>

	<li>PyQt ports can now be installed concurrently.</li>

	<li>As FreeBSD 10 reached its end of life, support for this
	branch has been
	removed from the Ports Collection. People still requiring
	FreeBSD 10
	support can use the RELEASE\_10\_EOL tag.</li>

	<li>USES=cmake now defaults to outsource</li>

	<li>KDE 4 has reached its end-of-life and has been removed
	from the Ports
	Collection.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each thread of execution gets 16 slots, called protection
	keys, while
	each userspace page mapping is tagged with one key.
	Processor
	provides a new 32bit register PKRU, which holds access and
	modification disable bits per key, the PKRU register is
	automatically
	context-switched, and managed by userspace using RDPKRU
	and WRPKRU
	instructions. See Intel SDM rev. 68 Vol 3 4.6.2 Protection
	Keys for
	further details.</p>

      <p>Since a key index must be always specified, this makes the
	key zero a
	default key, which permissions are tricky to modify
	without breaking
	the process environment. The rest 15 keys are usable, for
	instance
	process might put some sensitive data like decoded private
	key into
	the key protected area, and only enable access on as
	needed basis,
	without issuing costly mprotect(2) syscall. Note that
	permissions are
	enforced even for kernel access, so sneaky read(2) from
	other thread
	is subject to the same permission checks.</p>

      <p>I implemented the support for the amd64 pmap and provided
	convenient
	wrappers in libc both for 64bit and 32bit processes.
	Prototypes for
	the API are presented below and their use should be

      <p>The Migration feature uses the Save/Restore feature to
	migrate a bhyve guest
	from a FreeBSD host to another FreeBSD host. To migrate a
	bhyve guest,
	one needs to start an empty guest on the destination host
	from a shared guest
	image using the bhyve tool with the <tt>-R</tt> option
	followed by the source host
	IP and the port to listen to migration request. On the
	source host, the
	migration is started by executing the bhyvectl command
	with the <tt>--migrate</tt>
	or <tt>--migrate-live</tt> option, followed by the
	destination host IP and the
	port to send to the messages.</p>

      <p>New features added:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Prove that live migration cannot be implemented using the
	FreeBSD's Copy-on-Write mechanism;</li>

	<li>Add <tt>--migrate-live</tt> option to bhyvectl;</li>

	<li>Add additional message exchange between source and
	destination host to establish the migration type
	and the number of rounds;</li>

	<li>Implement a dirty-bit approach for live migrating the
	guest's wired memory;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Future tasks:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Clear the dirty bit after each migration round;</li>

	<li>Extend live migration to highmem segment;</li>

	<li>Extend live migration to unwired memory;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Save/Restore for bhyve feature is a suspend and resume
	facility added to the
	FreeBSD/amd64's hypervisor, bhyve. The bhyvectl tool is
	used to save the guest
	state in three files (a file for the guest memory, a file
	for devices' and CPU's
	state and another one for some metadata that are used in
	the restore process).
	To suspend a bhyve guest, the bhyvectl tool must be run
	with the <tt>--suspend
	&lt;state_file_name&gt;</tt>
	option followed by the guest name.</p>

      <p>To restore a bhyve guest from a checkpoint, one simply has
	to add the <tt>-r</tt> option
	followed by the main state file (the same file that was
	given to the <tt>--suspend</tt>
	option for bhyvectl) when starting the VM.</p>

      <p>New features added:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Improve timers' save and restore state feature;</li>

	<li>Fix synchronization issues related to the ahci device save
	and restore state feature;</li>

      <p>The major improvement in Capsicum is introducing a Casper
	service
	fileargs, which is an easy way helps to sandbox the utils
	which need
	access to the filesystem. There are several examples of
	usage fileargs
	in applications like brandelf(1), wc(1), savecore(1),
	head(1) and
	strings(1). The fileargs service also helps to bring new
	features to
	the bhyve like audio device which is secured using
	Capsicum.</p>

      <p>Another big step was introducing a private Casper service
	and
	sandboxing the rtsold(8) and rtsol(8).</p>

      <p>Next major improvement, which is still under the review,
	is rewriting
	the sysctl service. The new sysctl service will allow in
	an easy way
	to use cap_sysctl() and cap_sysctlnametomib().</p>

      <p>The i386 architecture (in modern terms, x86 architecture
	in 32bit
	protected mode), has supported hardware execute-disable
	since early
	200x. The only problem preventing the i386 FreeBSD kernel
	from using
	it was that default page table format used by the kernel
	is 2-level
	paging, while nx bit is only available for PAE (2.5
	levels) page table
	structures. PAE option is too intrusive, it changes both
	vm_paddr_t
	and bus_addr_t to 64bit, which is not too friendly to many
	drivers.</p>

      <p>I tried to provide PAE_PAGETABLES kernel option which only
	changed
	page table format, without affecting vm_paddr_t or
	bus_addr_t, thus
	keeping kernel/driver interfaces intact. But I was not
	able to make
	i386 releases carry two kernels, one to support relic
	hardware which
	cannot use PAE pagetables, and another for newer machines.</p>

      <p>So I finally did a merge which makes single i386 kernel
	carry two pmap
	modules, one for PAE and one for old two-level paging
	structures.
	Also I did not find a reason to not expand vm_paddr_t,
	while I have
	to keep bus_addr_t at 32bit.</p>

      <p>With a single boot-time knob, i386 kernel can now also
	utilize up to
	24G or memory, if drivers correctly use busdma(9). I tried
	to fix
	iflib(4) and ahci(4) so that the most common hardware
	work, but I
	cannot do the pass over the whole tree.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, together with earlier 4/4G split work, this
	gives enough
	life for i386 kernel.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD now supports TPM 2.0 devices. TPM (Trusted
	Platform Module) is a discrete chip which provides
	secure computation and secure NVRAM storage. It is
	most
	commonly associated with Measured Boot i.e. providing hash
	measurements of boot elements such as firmware
	images and boot configuration to the OS. In
	FreeBSD,
	the TPM can be used to strengthen security of services
	such as Strongswan IPsec, SSH or TLS by performing
	cryptographic operations in the TPM chip itself
	using
	embedded keys inaccessible to software. TPM facilities
	such as secure NVRAM storage, data sealing, random
	number generation and others are also available to
	any
	software via the IBM TSS library.</p>

      <p>UEFI Secure Boot is a technology which provides
	authentication of images that are executed on the
	host during boot. This prevents persistence of
	unauthorized malicious boot code such as rootkits. UEFI
	stores a list of allowed and blacklisted
	certificates and verifies signatures of all boot
	images and
	UEFI applications before they are executed on the CPU.
	Semihalf has developed support for X509
	certificates and signature
	verification code in EFI loader with the help of the
	minimal BearSSL library. Lists of allowed and
	forbidden certificates are retrieved from UEFI
	environmental
	variables. This allows users to sign kernel binaries with
	a self-signed certificate, append the signature
	and let the loader verify its authenticity.</p>

      <p>UEFI Secure Boot support code will most likely be
	integrated with sjg's Veriexec support which is
	currently being reviewed on Phabricator.</p>

      <p>Semihalf is also working on improving security of Veriexec
	by moving manifest signature verification to the
	kernel.</p>

	</p>
      <p>While pf itself can operate on multiple states
	simultaneously
	(on different cores), pfsync could not. It used a single
	PFSYNC_LOCK.
	This greatly reduced throughput on multicore systems as
	soon as pfsync
	was loaded.</p>

      <p>This was improved by splitting the pfsync queues into
	buckets, based on the
	state ID. This ensures that updates for a given connection
	always end up
	in the same bucket, allowing pfsync to still collapse
	multiple
	updates into one, while allowing multiple cores to proceed
	at the same
	time.
	The buckets are independently locked, allowing multiple
	cores to proceed at once.</p>

      <p>The number of buckets is tunable, but defaults to twice
	the number of cpus.
	Benchmarking has shown improvement of 30 to 100% depending
	on hardware and setup.</p>

      <p>During this effort several vnet-related issues were fixed
	as well, and a basic
	pfsync test case was added.</p>

      <p>This was committed into head in r341646, and later merged
	into stable/12 and stable/11.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD/RISC-V is getting more mature during last quarter.</p>

      <p>We have optimised RISC-V copyin(9)/copyout(9) routines.
	They now support word-sized copies where possible
	to dramatically increase speed of copying data
	between kernel and userspace.</p>

      <p>We made a series of improvements and bug fixes to pmap
	support (machine-dependent portion of virtual
	memory subsystem). This part was not touched
	during the last years, and is now getting
	attention.</p>

      <p>RISC-V GENERIC kernel gets support for witness(4) (The
	FreeBSD lock validation facility).</p>

      <p>The British company <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/" shape="rect">Embecosm</a> has
	reported that they were able to boot FreeBSD on
	real hardware -- a SiFive Unleashed board. The
	support is limited to a single core only. We are
	expecting patches from them.</p>

      <p>First of all, we removed KDE 4 from the ports tree this
	quarter.
	Qt4 will follow it by the end of march.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the update of libinput in ports we could finally
	update Plasma Desktop
	past 5.12, and are now again in sync with the upstream
	releases.</p>

      <p>KDE Frameworks and Applications were also kept in sync
	with upstream.</p>

      <p>We've also updated Qt5 to 5.12 -- with QtWebEngine still
	hanging on on 5.9.5
	for now, but thanks to a new contributor we should have
	5.12 by the end of Q1.</p>

      <p>In the background we changed the default behavior of

      <p>What is ClonOS?</p>

      <p>ClonOS is a turnkey open-source platform based on FreeBSD
	and the CBSD
	framework. ClonOS offers a complete web UI for an easy
	control, deployment
	and management of FreeBSD jails containers and bhyve/Xen
	hypervisor virtual
	environments.</p>

      <p>ClonOS is currently the only available platform which
	allows both Xen and bhyve
	hypervisors to coexist on the same host. Since ClonOS is a
	FreeBSD-based
	platform, it has the ability to create and manage jails
	natively, allowing
	you to run FreeBSD applications without losing
	performance.</p>

      <p>Features:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>easy management via web UI interface</li>

	<li>bhyve management (create, delete VM)</li>

	<li>Xen management (create, delete VM) [coming soon, roadmap]</li>

	</p>
      <p>Introduction to HardenedBSD</p>

      <p>HardenedBSD is a security-enhanced fork of FreeBSD that
	aims to
	provide the BSD community with a clean-room
	reimplementation of the
	publicly-documented parts of the grsecurity patchset for
	Linux. We
	maintain close compatibility with FreeBSD by syncing every
	six hours
	with FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>HardenedBSD Foundation Update</p>

      <p>Through a generous donation by DEF CON, the computer
	security
	conference held each year in Las Vegas, and an anonymous
	member of the
	community, the HardenedBSD Foundation was able to provide
	the
	HardenedBSD project with a new Cavium ThunderX2 server.
	HardenedBSD
	has been working closely with FreeBSD's and Cavium's
	Jayachandran
	(jchandra@freebsd) to gain working support for the
	ThunderX2. As soon
	as the ThunderX2 becomes functional, HardenedBSD will be
	able to
	support both 12-STABLE and 13-CURRENT for arm64.</p>

      <p>We assisted OPNsense's migration from FreeBSD to
	HardenedBSD as the
	base operating system. OPNsense's January 2019 release
	(19.1) will
	complete the migration. Further work will be done to
	enable
	HardenedBSD's PaX NOEXEC implementation in OPNsense. PaX
	NOEXEC is a
	strong form of W^X, which prevents memory allocations from
	being both
	writable and executable, and toggling between the two.</p>

      <p>The HardenedBSD Foundation Corp. is a registered 501(c)(3)
	tax-exempt
	not-for-profit charitable organization in the United
	States. We look
	forward to a productive 2019, with work to support
	Cross-DSO CFI still
	ongoing.</p>

      <p>HardenedBSD 12-STABLE Released</p>

      <p>In December 2018, HardenedBSD published is first official
	release of
	<a href="https://hardenedbsd.org/article/op/2018-12-17/stable-release-hardenedbsd-stable-12-stable-v1200058" shape="rect">12-STABLE</a>.
	From the release announcement:</p>

      <p>Improvements in 12-STABLE from 11-STABLE:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Non-Cross-DSO Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) for
	applications on
	amd64 and arm64. At this time, CFI is not applied to the
	kernel.
	More info on CFI is below.</li>

	<li>Jailed bhyve (upstreamed to FreeBSD)</li>

	<li>Per-jail toggles for unprivileged process debugging (the
	<tt>security.bsd.unprivileged_process_debug</tt> sysctl
	node. Upstreamed
	to FreeBSD.)</li>

	<li>Spectre v2 mitigation with retpoline applied to the
	entirety of
	base and ports (with only a few ports opting out.)</li>

	<li>Symmetric Multi-Threading (SMT) disabled by default
	(re-enable by
	setting <tt>machdep.hyperthreading_allowed</tt> to 1 in
	loader.conf(5)).</li>

	<li>Migration of more compiler toolchain components to llvm's
	implementations (llvm-ar, llvm-nm, and llvm-objdump).</li>

	<li>Compilation of applications with Link-Time Optimization
	(LTO).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Non-Cross-DSO CFI</p>

      <p>Non-Cross-DSO CFI is an exploit mitigation technique that
	helps
	to prevent attackers from modifying the behavior of a
	program and
	jumping to undefined or arbitrary memory locations.
	Microsoft has
	implemented a variant of CFI, which they term Control Flow
	Guard,
	or CFG. The PaX team has spent the last few years
	perfecting their
	Reuse Attack Protector, RAP. CFI, CFG, and RAP all attempt
	to
	accomplish the same goal, with RAP being the most complete
	and
	effective implementation. Clang's CFI is stronger than
	Microsoft's
	CFG and PaX Team's RAP is stronger than both CFI and CFG.
	RAP would
	be a great addition to HardenedBSD; however, it requires a
	GPLv3
	toolchain and is patented.</p>

      <p>Clang's CFI requires a linker that supports Link-Time
	Optimization
	(LTO). HardenedBSD 12-STABLE ships with lld as the default
	linker.
	All CFI schemes have been enabled for nearly all
	applications in
	base. Please note that any application that calls function
	pointers
	resolved via dlopen + dlsym will require the cfi-icall
	scheme to be
	disabled.</p>

      <p>HardenedBSD is the first enterprise operating system to
	apply
	Non-Cross-DSO CFI broadly to userland.</p>

	</p>
      <p>Background</p>

      <p>The nosh project is a suite of system-level utilities for
	initializing,
	running, and shutting down BSD systems; and for managing
	daemons,
	terminals, and logging.</p>

      <p>It supersedes BSD <tt>init</tt>, the Mewburn <tt>rc</tt>
	system, and OpenRC, drawing
	inspiration from
	<a href="http://untroubled.org/daemontools-encore/" shape="rect">daemontools-encore</a>
	for
	service control/status mechanisms,
	<a href="http://jdebp.eu./FGA/UCSPI.html" shape="rect">UCSPI</a> for
	networked services, Solaris
	SMF for named milestones, and IBM AIX for separated
	service and system
	management. It includes a range of compatibility
	mechanisms, including
	shims for familiar commands from other systems, and an
	automatic import
	mechanism that takes existing configuration data from
	<tt>/etc/fstab</tt>,
	<tt>/etc/rc.conf{,.local}</tt>, <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, and
	elsewhere, applying them to
	its native service definitions and creating additional
	native services.</p>

      <p>It is portable (including to Linux) and composable, it
	provides a
	migration path from the world of systemd Linux, and it
	does not require
	new kernel APIs. It provides clean service environments,
	has orderings
	and dependencies between services, has parallelized
	startup and shutdown
	(including <tt>fsck</tt>), provides strictly size-capped
	and autorotated
	logging, has the service manager as a "subreaper",
	provides per-user
	service management as well as system-wide, provides
	user-space virtual
	terminals, brings TTY login under the general service
	management
	umbrella, and uses <tt>kevent</tt>(2) for event-driven
	parallelism.</p>

      <p>For more, see the aforelinked <tt>Introduction and
	blurb</tt>, and the
	<tt>nosh Guide</tt>.</p>

      <p>News</p>

      <p>The project has seen a lot of development since the last
	status report
	in 2017. To briefly touch upon just some of the things
	that have been
	worked on:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>There are several more packages for things like running
	Bruce Guenter's bcron, shims for OpenRC's
	<tt>rc-update</tt> and <tt>rc-service</tt> tools,
	and shims for portable substitutes for a couple of
	Linux's util-linux tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>There are quite a lot of new tools, including
	<tt>getuidgid</tt>, <tt>userenv-fromenv</tt>,
	<tt>setgid-fromenv</tt>, <tt>envgid</tt>,
	<tt>printenv</tt>, <tt>setlogin</tt>,
	<tt>console-decode-ecma48</tt>,
	<tt>console-control-sequence</tt>,
	<tt>console-flat-table-viewer</tt>,
	<tt>console-input-method</tt>, and
	<tt>local-stream-socket-connect</tt>. To look at
	just two of these:</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/printenv.html" shape="rect">printenv</a>
	as a built-in allows more convenient use in
	conjunction with <tt>clearenv</tt>. It can also
	generate output in some additional formats.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/console-control-sequence.html" shape="rect">console-control-sequence</a>
	also responds to the name <tt>setterm</tt>, and
	can do most of what the non-portable util-linux
	tool by that name does; excluding the things that
	are specific to non-portable Linux
	<tt>ioctl()</tt>s and control codes (such as
	display adapter power management), but also
	including _extra_ standard DEC VT and ECMA-48
	things that the util-linux tool does _not_ do
	(such as turning strikethrough, calculator keypad
	application mode, mouse reports, and the
	alternative screen buffer on and off).</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>There are a lot of new service bundles for more services,
	too many to list here. One can find them listed in
	the 1.37 and 1.38 + 1.39 release announcements.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>There are new chapters in the <tt>nosh Guide</tt>, on
	packages and ports, on resources for terminals
	such as keyboard maps, input methods, and fonts,
	and on how the <tt>head0</tt> user-space virtual
	terminal is structured.
	There are also new manual pages - in addition to the ones
	for all of the new commands, of course - on the
	subjects of the <a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/TerminalCapabilities.html" shape="rect">http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/TerminalCapabilities.html</a>
	system.
	There are also <a href="http://jdebp.eu./Proposals/linux-kvt-manual-pages.html" shape="rect">some
	replacements for some Linux manual pages</a> that
	have gone missing over the past decade.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>The external format configuration import subsystem has
	seen some major improvements in per-user service
	configuration. The per-user service manager itself
	gained a control FIFO, addressing a long-standing
	bug.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	A particular area of improvement since the last status
	report is the
	inclusion of input method capabilities in user-space
	virtual terminals.
	The input method mechanism uses the same CIN files as used
	by several
	other softwares, similar to how one can use existing
	SCO/FreeBSD
	keyboard maps and FreeBSD vt fonts. It places a simple
	textual user
	interface on top of a user-space virtual terminal, can
	switch amongst
	multiple input methods on the fly, and responds to both
	the dedicated
	keys on a JIS 106/109-key keyboard or a Korean 103/106-key
	keyboard and
	the conventional keys used on other keyboards. The blurb
	includes
	<a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/japanese-input-methods.html" shape="rect">an
	example of how this works for a Japanese user</a>,
	and the virtual terminal chapters of the <tt>nosh
	Guide</tt> now incorporate
	input methods into the doco.</p>

      <p>Another area of work was eliminating Wide NCurses from
	almost all of the
	tools, apart from the one tool that by definition uses it
	(console-ncurses-realizer). Wide NCurses has long been a
	porting
	difficulty for several operating systems, including Gentoo
	Linux and
	OpenBSD, and does not really model modern real world
	terminals and
	terminal emulators very well. It has been replaced by a
	new
	TerminalCapabilities library, in conjunction with a
	library for handling
	ECMA-48 character sequence decoding and ECMA-48/DEC VT
	control sequence
	generation. The decoder is the basis for the new
	<tt>console-decode-ecma48</tt> tool, for example, as well
	as being the decoder
	for terminal input in <tt>console-termio-realizer</tt> and
	in full-screen TUI
	tools like
	<a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/chkservice.html" shape="rect">chkservice</a>
	and the new
	<a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/nosh/guide/console-flat-table-viewer.html" shape="rect">console-flat-table-viewer</a>.</p>

      <p>The external formats import subsystem will also now make a
	replacement
	<tt>/etc/system-control/convert/termcap/termcap.db</tt>
	that one can use, which
	includes amongst other things the currently missing
	<tt>teken</tt> terminal type.</p>

      <p>Roadmap</p>

      <p>In addition to what is on the aforelinked roadmap, several
	things are on
	the cards for forthcoming versions. Tools that can feed
	the process
	table into <tt>console-flat-table-viewer</tt> in the
	proper vis(3) form. The
	ability to have different keyboard maps for different
	keyboards if one
	has multiple keyboards. A Linux shim for
	<tt>login.conf</tt>. Proper handling
	of CSI sub-parameters in SoftTerm. A manual page for the
	CIN file
	format. A <tt>time-env-next-matching</tt> tool.</p>

      <p>How you can help</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The Z shell completions now have extensive coverage of the
	toolset, but there are no completions for the
	Bourne Again shell or the Friendly Interactive
	shell. Work on such completions would be welcome.
	The users who use those shells would welcome it
	especially.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>The <tt>system-manager</tt> already recognizes a
	<tt>-b</tt> option for <a href="http://jdebp.eu./FGA/emergency-and-rescue-mode-bootstrap.html" shape="rect">emergency
	mode</a>. Work to make the FreeBSD loader and
	kernel send such an option to process #1, in
	response to an additional emergency mode boot menu
	choice, would be very welcome.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li>The <tt>monitor-fsck-progress</tt> and
	<tt>monitored-fsck</tt> tools stand ready to work
	with a <tt>-C</tt> option to <tt>fsck</tt> that
	makes it spit out progress information to an open
	file descriptor. Another way to help is to add
	this capability to <tt>fsck</tt>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>teken</tt> needs to be added to base termcap. It was
	put into NCurses terminfo back in 2014.</li>
      </ul>

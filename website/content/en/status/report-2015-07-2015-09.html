          <div id="contentwrap"><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The third quarter of 2015, from July to September, was
      again a period of busy activity for FreeBSD: for the second quarter
      in a row we have the largest report yet published.</p><p>The Foundation continues to play a strong role, bringing
      both a developer and evangelist presence to conferences, funding
      much of the hardware that the cluster administration team uses to
      keep things running, and sponsoring many development projects for
      FreeBSD.  This quarter we also hear from some of the student projects
      funded by Google Summer of Code 2015, ranging a wide gamut from
      the bootloader to additional ARM support, but also at a range of
      completion status.  Some of the GSoC output is in the tree
      already, but others could benefit from additional attention to
      help out our budding new contributors as their schedules fill with
      the return to classes.</p><p>ZFS and the network stack continue to be strong areas for
      FreeBSD, with both receiving active maintenance and feature
      improvements during this quarter.  Substantial work continues on
      arm64, potentially putting it on the path toward a promotion to
      Tier-1 status, and a new port to the RISC-V architecture has
      made great headway in a short period of time.  But it is not just
      our strengths and exciting new areas that have seen attention this
      cycle; there are also some parts of the system that are frequently
      perceived as unchanging infrastructure that have received
      attention and improvements, with <tt>truss</tt> and
      (<tt>k</tt>)<tt>gdb</tt> receiving significant overhauls, new
      implementations for the man page tools being brought in, the
      website receiving a new skin, and a brand new system for
      translating documentation that greatly lowers the barrier to
      entry.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its record length, this report does
      not and cannot cover all of the work being done on FreeBSD throughout
      the reporting period &#8212; there are many bug fixes too minor to
      mention here, and developers too busy working on the next project
      to write up an entry for the previous project.  It is not just the
      developers committing to Subversion that comprise the ongoing
      activities of FreeBSD, but also the users testing unreleased
      code or reporting bugs in released code, and participants on the
      mailing lists and forums helping each other solve their problems.
      Even the chats on IRC that wander far from the stated topic of a
      channel contribute to the community around FreeBSD; it is that
      community whose effectiveness and helpfulness is a key component
      of the effectiveness and usefulness of FreeBSD itself.  Not just to

	</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team consists of the people
	responsible for administering the machines that the project
	relies on for its distributed work and communications to be
	synchronised.</p>

      <p>Our primary cluster has been hosted as a guest in California
	for many years.  Our ongoing project is relocating the core
	functionality to a location in New Jersey with a formal
	hosting arrangement.  This is an equipment refresh,
	consolidation for better use of resources, and for better
	continuity of service.</p>

      <p>There is a significant amount of behind-the-scenes work to
	make this happen.  The original cluster was implemented with
	a common, shared, assumed-to-be secure network with
	ubiquitous NFS everywhere.  This structure does not lend
	itself well to being distributed across geographically
	diverse locations, particularly when Internet transit is
	required.  The bulk of the work is rebuilding services to be
	portable, stand-alone components that do not depend on
	shared-network access and are safe enough to use across the
	insecure Internet.</p>

      <p>Highlights this quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Many internal distribution systems switched from rsync to
	  a distribution mesh using "syncthing".</li>

	<li>We have implemented more code/data signing infrastructure
	  with out-of-band verification.</li>

	<li>New 32-core reference build hosts are online.</li>

	<li>Internal admbugs switched from bugzilla 4.4 to 5.0 and
	  packages were made available for the bugmeister team.</li>

	<li>Finally switched from varnish3 to varnish4.</li>

	<li>We exorcised hub.FreeBSD.org, the last survivor of the
	  2012 security incident.</li>

	<li>vuxml and the legacy portaudit build system were converted
	  to components and integrated.</li>

	<li>https://download.FreeBSD.org/ is nearing completion
	  (please do not use until officially announced).</li>

	<li>A Taiwan node was brought into service for pkg, ftp,
	  svn, and vuxml mirroring.</li>

	<li>One of the freebsd-update mirrors was converted from
	  lighttpd to nginx due to a data corruption bug.</li>

	<li>We completed detachment of the svn repository from the old
	  cluster and moved it to its new location.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ongoing:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The cluster runs a mixture of 11-current and 10-stable as
	  part of our "eat our own dogfood" project.  For
	  this to be useful, we do monthly cluster refreshes to keep
	  up with current code.</li>

	<li>We build internal base system snapshots every few days
	  and packages every day.</li>

	<li>We also provide support for non-clusteradm-operated
	  services including jenkins, reviews, portsnap,
	  freebsd-update, bugzilla, package builders, git, and
	  mercurial.  This varies from as little as maintaining SSL
	  front-ends through operating servers, distributing data or
	  building packages/binaries to run.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project releases
	of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes, and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>In mid-August, the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team
	released FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE, two weeks earlier than the
	original schedule anticipated.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team would like to thank
	all that have tested the BETA and RC builds and reported
	issues during the release cycle.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team, with approval from
	the FreeBSD Core Team, appointed Marius Strobl as the Deputy
	Lead.</p>
    <p>This project was sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation.</p><hr /><h2><a name="The-FreeBSD-Core-Team" href="#The-FreeBSD-Core-Team" id="The-FreeBSD-Core-Team">The FreeBSD Core Team</a></h2><p>
	Contact: FreeBSD Core Team &lt;<a href="mailto:core@FreeBSD.org">core@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p>
      <p>The biggest task handled by the Core Team during this quarter
	was developing and publishing the new Code of Conduct.  The
	Code of Conduct describes how people are expected to behave on
	all FreeBSD official communication channels, as well as how
	developers and other people involved with the project are to
	behave when representing the project in public.</p>

      <p>The Code of Conduct was generally well received and elicited
	numerous comments and suggestions for improvements from the
	community, many of which have been integrated.</p>

      <p>The next task handled by Core was the restoration of Babak
	Farrokhi's ports commit bit.  Babak resides in Iran.  A few
	years ago, legal advice suggested that allowing contributions
	from Iranian residents might violate US trade sanctions.
	After several years, Core was asked to revisit the issue.  On
	the advice of counsel, Core decided that it could restore
	commit privileges to commmitters residing in Iran.</p>

      <p>The CTM service came under security review.  Given that the
	lack of use of routine authenticity checking made the
	injection of trivial exploit code relatively easy, the service
	was held to be too risky to continue as an official part of
	the FreeBSD base system.  CTM has very few remaining users but
	they should be able to install CTM from the Ports Collection
	in order to continue doing so.</p>

      <p>Core learned that ISC was ceasing its hosting service, which
	has entailed a rapid rework of plans on the movement of
	significant portions of the FreeBSD cluster to that data center.
	Cluster administration has taken ownership of the situation
	and is making progress.</p>

      <p>Core fielded an enquiry about NextBSD and whether this should
	be the future direction for the whole FreeBSD project.  Core's
	position is that NextBSD is an interesting project, and we
	regard it, like the other BSD projects, as a potential source
	of good ideas.  However, we currently have no plans to adopt
	NextBSD as the official FreeBSD distribution.</p>

      <p>Beyond these issues, Core also spent time in various routine
	activities.  During this quarter we issued three new src
	commit bits, and took none in for safekeeping.  Welcome to
	Allan Jude, Marcelo Araujo, and Andriy Voskoboinyk.</p>

      <p>The <tt>automtud</tt> script will allow a FreeBSD machine to
	send jumbo frames to machines that support them, while using
	normal-sized frames for other machines.</p>

      <p>There are various advantages to using jumbo frames, such as
	reduced protocol overhead.  It also means that TCP streams
	will not be segmented as much, although TSO helps mitigate the
	disadvantages of such segmentation.  In cases where LRO does
	not work well, fewer packets will be received.</p>

      <p>The script currently does not restore the system to its
	original state when it exits.  This means that you must
	manually change the interface MTU and delete host routes
	after stopping the script.
      </p>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>Fix up various Ethernet drivers to better support jumbo
	  frames.  Most Ethernet drivers, though they support
	  scatter/gather, use a physically contiguous zone to do so,
	  which can cause resource shortages.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>More testing is needed to ensure that things behave as
	  expected.  This means that when running the script,
	  communication to all machines functions normally, without
	  slowdown or connectivity issues.  Check
	  <tt>vmstat -z | grep mbuf</tt> to ensure that such issues
	  are not due to running out of <tt>jumbo_9k</tt> or
	  <tt>jumbo_16k</tt> buffers due to Ethernet driver
	  issues.</p>

      <p><tt>bhyve</tt> is a hypervisor that runs on the FreeBSD/amd64
	platform.  At present, it runs FreeBSD (8.x or later), Linux
	i386/x64, OpenBSD i386/amd64, NetBSD/amd64, Illumos, and
	Windows Vista/7/8/10/2008r2/2012r2/2016 x64 guests.  Current
	development is focused on enabling additional guest operating
	systems and implementing features found in other
	hypervisors.</p>

      <p>A combined <tt>bhyve</tt> and ZFS BoF was held during vBSDCon
	2015, hosted by Michael Dexter and Allan Jude.  Questions
	asked about <tt>bhyve</tt> included live migration and
	suspend/resume support, and configurations using ZFS.</p>

      <p>Three <tt>bhyve</tt>-related projects were selected for GSoC
	2015: NE2000 device emulation, porting <tt>bhyve</tt> to ARM,
	and ptnetmap support.</p>

      <p>The major enhancement for <tt>bhyve</tt> this quarter was
	support for external firmware, along with a port of the Intel
	edk2 UEFI firmware.  This allows <tt>bhyve</tt> to run Windows
	in headless mode, and also Illumos.</p>

      <p>We have updated <tt>clang</tt>, <tt>llvm</tt>, <tt>lldb</tt>,
	<tt>compiler-rt</tt>, and <tt>libc++</tt> in base to the 3.7.0
	release.  These all contain numerous improvements.  Please see
	the linked release notes for more detailed information.  This
	brings us completely up-to-date with the latest upstream
	versions of these projects.  Meanwhile, Ed Maste is working
	on importing the llvm.org version of <tt>libunwind</tt>.</p>

      <p>Like the 3.5.x and 3.6.x releases, these components require
	C++11 support to build.  At this point, FreeBSD 10.0 and later
	provide that support, at least on x86. Currently, there are no
	solid plans to MFC these versions to any stable branches, due
	to the difficulties this would introduce for the usual upgrade
	scenarios.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Ed Maste and Andrew Turner for their help with this
	import, and thanks to Antoine Brodin for several ports
	exp-runs.</p>

      <p>During the first ports exp-run, some major problems were
	found, one introduced by a <tt>clang</tt> bug which caused

      <p>With the advent of DTrace we are able to replace many of
	the internal kernel debugging options, such as TCPDEBUG, with
	statically defined tracepoints (SDTs).  Tracepoints have now
	been added to the system that replicate the functionality of
	the TCPDEBUG kernel option.  No new kernel options need to be
	added &#8212; they are standard with any kernel that has
	DTrace, which is included in the default GENERIC kernels in
	10.X and HEAD.</p>

      <p>The Acer C720 Chromebook is an affordable (under $200) and
	powerful little laptop that provides a battery life of up to
	six hours running FreeBSD.  It is a great machine for travelling
	and coding in general.  The machine is fully functional,
	meaning that all essential devices work: keyboard, trackpad,
	light sensor, backlight control, display in VESA mode (fast),
	external Display on HDMI (only VESA mirror mode), sound, USB
	ports, SD card slot, camera, and Atheros wireless.</p>

      <p>This quarter, this project extended previous work on the
	boot process and keyboard driver as well as the
	<tt>smbus(4)</tt> driver.  It added three new drivers:
	<tt>ig4(4)</tt> for the I2C bus, <tt>cyapa(4)</tt> for the
	trackpad, and <tt>isl(4)</tt>, for the ambient light sensor.</p>

      <p>Much of the development was originally done in late 2014.
	Since then, the patches have been massively improved and
	merged into HEAD, so that all relevant devices work without
	manual patching.</p>

      <p>For those who are unable to run HEAD, there is a
	backported patch to 10.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>Thanks to everyone who helped in the process.  I couldn't
	have done it without you (you know who you are).</p>

      <p>CAM Target Layer (CTL), when originally developed by
	Copan/SGI, had support for High Availability clustering.
	Unfortunately, significant portions of the HA code were never
	published with the main body of the source code.  Now, the
	missing part has been reimplemented from scratch, fixed, and
	improved.</p>

      <p>This code supports dual-node HA with Asynchronous LUN Unit
	Access (ALUA) in four modes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Active/Unavailable without interlink between nodes, where
	  the secondary node can report nothing except its
	  presence.</li>

	<li>Active/Standby with the secondary node handling only basic
	  LUN discovery and reservation, synchronizing state and
	  command execution with the primary node through the
	  interlink.</li>

	<li>Active/Active with both nodes processing commands and
	  accessing the backing storage, synchronizing state and
	  command execution with the primary node through the
	  interlink.</li>

	<li>Active/Active with the secondary node having no backing
	  storage access, but instead working as a proxy, transferring
	  all commands to the first node for execution through the
	  interlink.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the case of lost interlink connectivity to primary node,
	the secondary node falls into the Transitioning state, which
	is like Unavailable and cannot answer most requests, but makes
	the initiator wait for recovery or cluster failover.</p>

      <p>CTL also got a large number of other improvements, including
	support for emulation of CD/DVD drives and removable disks,
	live LUN reconfiguration, and so on.</p>

      <p>The code is committed to FreeBSD head and was recently merged to
	the stable/10 branch.</p>

      <p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an extension to TCP that allows
	for the use of multiple network interfaces on a standard TCP
	session.  The addition of new addresses and scheduling of data
	across them occurs transparently from the perspective of the
	TCP application.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to deliver an MPTCP kernel
	patch that interoperates with the reference MPTCP
	implementation, along with additional enhancements to aid
	network research.</p>

      <p>The v0.5 patch was released, which is the first patch
	of the re-written implementation.  We are in the process of
	documenting the new design and addressing some feedback as
	provided from the community.</p>

      <p>Work has commenced on improved input handling, as the current
	method of receiving and reassembling segments has been the
	cause of some instability and stalls during connection
	shutdown.  This will involve re-using the subflow receive
	buffers and an upcall to enqueue a MP-layer reassembly task
	without the need to take a lock on the MP control block.  The
	improvements should also allow bypassing <tt>mptcp_usrreq</tt>
	for standard TCP connections.</p>

      <p>The MPTCP commit history was synchronized with
	hg-beta.FreeBSD.org, and we have made the repository available on
	BitBucket (see links).  Future patch releases will be tagged
	there.  The tree is now merged with FreeBSD head weekly.  An
	updated v0.51 patch is ready for release.</p>

      <p>A feature long missing from FreeBSD was the ability to boot up
	with a temporary rootfs, configure the kernel to be able to
	access the real rootfs, and then replace the temporary root
	with the real one.  In Linux, this functionality is known as
	pivot_root.  The reroot project aims to provide similar
	functionality in a different, slightly more user-friendly, way.
	Simply put, from the user's point of view it is as simple as
	running <tt>reboot -r</tt>.  The system performs a partial
	shutdown, killing all processes and unmounting the rootfs, and
	then partial bringup, mounting the new rootfs, running init,
	and running the startup scripts as usual.</p>

      <p>The kernel part of the project has been committed to
	11-CURRENT.  The userland part is at the "finishing touches"
	stage, and is expected to be committed soon.  A merge to
	stable/10 is planned and reroot support is planned be included
	in FreeBSD 10.3.</p>

      <p>The Mesa ports were updated to 10.6.8.  At the same time, the
	ports received a major overhaul to make sure all ports are
	correctly configured.  Dual version support was removed.
	There is only one Mesa version for all supported FreeBSD
	versions.  The <tt>libosmesa</tt> port, which provided
	the off-screen version of
	Mesa,  was merged into the Mesa framework.</p>

      <p>Another big item that was included in the Mesa port is
	OpenCL.  There are two GPU-based OpenCL implementations:
	<tt>lang/clover</tt> for supported Radeon cards, and
	<tt>lang/beignet</tt> for supported Intel cards (currently
	only Ivybridge).  Thanks go to Johannes Dieterich, O.
	Hartmann, and Koop Mast for making this happen.</p>

      <p>Now that Mesa is up-to-date, we can apply the same update
	procedure to the X.Org server.  It is currently at 1.14, and
	an update to 1.17 is ready.  It will be committed shortly.</p>

      <p>On the kernel side, progress has been made with the i915
	update.  The driver is able to attach.  There are some reports
	that the X.Org server starts but Mesa is unhappy, so
	acceleration does not work yet.  If you want to test,
	instructions will be posted on the wiki in the i915 update
	article (see links).  At this stage, we can only accept
	patches, though &#8212; we will not be able to provide
	support.</p>

      <p>We attended two conferences: XDC 2015 in Toronto and
	EuroBSDcon 2015 in Stockholm.  Reports will be posted on the

      <p>The nosh project is a suite of system-level utilities for
	initializing, running, and shutting down BSD systems, and for
	managing daemons, terminals, and logging.  It supersedes BSD
	<tt>init</tt> and the NetBSD <tt>rc.d</tt> system, drawing
	inspiration from Solaris SMF for named milestones,
	daemontools-encore for service control/status mechanisms,
	UCSPI, and IBM AIX for separated service and system
	management.  It comprises a range of compatibility mechanisms,
	including shims for familiar commands from other systems, and
	an automatic import mechanism that takes existing
	configuration data from <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>,
	<tt>/etc/rc.conf{,.local}</tt>, <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, and
	elsewhere, applying them to its native service definitions and
	creating additional native services.  It is portable
	(including to Linux) and composable, it provides a migration
	path from the world of systemd Linux, and it does not require new
	kernel APIs.  It provides clean service environments,
	orderings and dependencies between services, parallelized
	startup and shutdown (including <tt>fsck</tt>), strictly
	size-capped and autorotated logging, the service manager as a
	"subreaper", and uses <tt>kevent(2)</tt> for
	event-driven parallelism.</p>

      <p>The past few months have seen a growth in the import
	mechanism, with full import of <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and
	<tt>/etc/ttys</tt> available in version 1.18 in July, and
	importing PC-BSD Warden and FreeBSD 9 jails, and full import
	of <tt>gbde</tt> and <tt>geli</tt> mount/unmount mechanisms in
	version 1.21 in October.  It has also gained the ability to
	automatically re-generate <tt>host.conf</tt> and
	<tt>sysctl.conf</tt> whenever their source files change.</p>

      <p>Other developments in the past few months include fully
	independent shutdown support, no longer relying upon an
	externally provided shutdown command from another toolset, and
	a full suite of binary packages.  As of version 1.20, it
	became possible to have a fully-<tt>nosh</tt>-managed system,
	on both FreeBSD and Linux, using just precompiled binary
	packages.</p>

      <p>The biggest task remaining is one that was set a while ago:
	the creation of enough native service bundles and ancillary
	utilities to entirely supplant the <tt>rc.d</tt> system.  A
	lot of this has been achieved, with the original target list
	of 157 items now down to just 39 remaining.  These are the
	tricky ones, of course, where help is most needed.
      </p>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>There are still a few rc scripts left that should be easy
	  to convert, such as <tt>/etc/rc.d/gptboot</tt> and

	  Linux.  (History: The <tt>-b</tt> mechanism and idea date
	  back to version 2.57d of Miquel van Smoorenburg's System 5

      <p>A number of UEFI bug fixes were committed over the last
	quarter, improving compatibility with different UEFI
	implementations.  This includes improvements to EFI's
	<tt>vt(4)</tt> framebuffer driver, <tt>efifb</tt>, to handle
	systems with high resolution displays and unusual framebuffer
	stride values.  In particular, this improves compatibility
	with a large number of recent Apple MacBook Pros and other

      <p>PCI Express (PCIe) hot-plug is used on both laptops and
	servers to allow peripheral devices to be added or removed
	while the system is running.  Laptops commonly include
	hot-pluggable PCIe as either an ExpressCard slot or a
	Thunderbolt interface.  ExpressCard has built-in USB support
	that is already supported by FreeBSD, but ExpressCard PCIe
	devices like Gigabit Ethernet adapters and eSATA cards are
	only supported when they are present at boot, and their
	removal may cause FreeBSD to crash.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to allow these devices to be
	inserted and removed while FreeBSD is running.  This work will
	provide the basic infrastructure to support adding and
	removing devices, though it is expected that additional work
	will be needed to update individual drivers to support
	hot-plug.</p>

      <p>Current testing is focused on getting a simple UART device
	functional.  Basic hot swap is currently functional.</p>

	now available on github.com.

      <p>CloudABI is a POSIX-like runtime environment that uses
	Capsicum as its sole access control mechanism.  CloudABI
	allows you to develop software that is better hardened against
	security vulnerabilities, is easier to test, and is easier to
	migrate across systems.</p>

      <p>As of August, all of the kernel modifications that are needed
	to run CloudABI programs have been integrated into FreeBSD head.
	After loading the <tt>cloudabi64</tt> kernel module, you can
	either run CloudABI programs directly from the shell or by
	using the <tt>cloudabi-run</tt> tool
	(<tt>sysutils/cloudabi-utils</tt>).  <tt>cloudabi-run</tt>
	allows you to inject sockets, files, and directories into the
	launched program in a more structured way.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, work has started on developing a Ports
	Collection that contains cross-compiled utilities and
	libraries for CloudABI. The intent is that this framework
	generates native packages for a number of operating systems,
	making it possible to develop CloudABI applications on any
	operating system, regardless of whether that operating system
	actually supports CloudABI.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in CloudABI, be sure to go to the
	project page on GitHub, watch recordings of talks at
	conferences, or wait for the upcoming edition of the FreeBSD
	Journal, which will feature an article on CloudABI.</p>
    <p>This project was sponsored by Nuxi, the Netherlands.</p><h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>CloudABI is currently only available for amd64.  It would
	  make sense to port CloudABI to additional architectures like
	  aarch64.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Support for CloudABI has only been integrated into FreeBSD.
	  If we manage to upstream support for CloudABI into other
	  operating systems, it should be possible to run the same
	  binary on multiple operating systems without
	  recompilation.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>The CloudABI Ports Collection currently has only 60
	  packages.  Although these packages already the building blocks of
	  some interesting software, we are always interested in
	  expanding.</p>

      <p>Xen is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing
	services that allow multiple computer operating systems to
	execute on the same computer hardware concurrently.  Xen
	support for FreeBSD on x86 as a guest was introduced in version 8
	and ARM support is currently being worked on.  Support for
	running FreeBSD as an amd64 Xen host (Dom0) is available in
	HEAD.</p>

      <p>On the x86 front, most of the work during this quarter
	focused on the implementation of PVH inside Xen.
	Consequently, most of the activity happened inside of the
	hypervisor.  Patches for a clean PVH implementation have been
	posted, with the aim of having them merged in the next Xen
	release (4.7).  Once that is done, work will continue
	adding new features to both FreeBSD and Xen to have feature
	parity with traditional PV guests/hosts.</p>

      <p>Apart from this, work is ongoing to import a new netfront
	from Linux in order to support new features, like split event
	channel and multiple queue support.</p>

      <p>On the ARM front, this quarter's work focused on getting
	FreeBSD/arm64 booting as a Xen guest.  The current activity is to
	upstream patches preparing Xen drivers to support arm64.  This
	includes a rework of the console driver.</p>

      <p>Atomic operations serve two fundamental purposes.  First,
	they are the building blocks for expressing synchronization
	algorithms in a single, machine-independent way using
	high-level languages.  In essense, atomics abstract the
	different building blocks supported by the various
	architectures on which FreeBSD runs, making it easier to develop
	and reason about lock-less code by hiding hardware-level
	details.</p>

      <p>Atomics also provide the barrier operations that allow
	software to control the effects on memory of out-of-order and
	speculative execution in modern processors as well as
	optimizations by compilers.  This capability is especially
	important to multithreaded software, such as the FreeBSD kernel,
	when running on systems where multiple processors communicate
	through a shared main memory.</p>

      <p>Each machine architecture defines a memory model, which
	specifies the possible effects on memory of out-of-order and
	speculative execution.  More precisely, it specifies the
	extent to which the machine may visibly reorder memory
	accesses to optimize performance.  Unfortunately,
	there are almost as many models as architectures.
	Some architectures, for example IA32 or Sparcv9 TSO, are
	relatively strongly ordered.  In contrast, others, like
	PowerPC or ARM, are very relaxed.  In effect, atomics define a
	very relaxed abstract memory model for FreeBSD's
	machine-independent code that can be efficiently realized on
	any of these architectures.</p>

      <p>Most FreeBSD development and testing still happens on
	x86 machines, which, when combined with x86's strongly ordered
	memory model, leads to errors in the use of atomics,
	specifically, barriers.  In other words, the code is not
	properly written to FreeBSD's abstract memory model, but the
	strong ordering of the x86 architecture hides this fact.  The
	architectures impacted by the code that incorrectly uses
	atomics are less popular or have limited availability, and the
	resulting bugs from the misuse of atomics are hard to
	diagnose.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to audit and upgrade the usage of
	lockless facilities, hopefully fixing bugs before they are
	observed in the wild.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD defines its own set of atomics operations, like many
	other operating systems.  But unlike other operating systems,
	FreeBSD models its atomics and barriers on the release
	consistency model, which is also known as acquire/release
	model.  This is the same model which is used by the C11 and
	C++11 language standards as well as the new 64-bit ARM
	architecture.  Despite having syntactical differences, C11 and
	FreeBSD atomics share essentially the same semantics.
	Consequently, ample tutorials about the C11 memory model and
	algorithms expressed with C11 atomics can be trivially reused
	under FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>One facility of C11 that was missing from FreeBSD atomics
	was <em>fences</em>.  Fences are bidirectional barrier
	operations which could not be expressed by the existing
	atomic+barrier accesses.  They were added in r285283.</p>

      <p>Due to the strong memory model implemented by x86 processors,
	<tt>atomic_load_acq()</tt> and <tt>atomic_store_rel()</tt> can
	be implemented by plain load and store instructions with only
	a compiler barrier.  No additional ordering constraints are
	required.  This simplification of <tt>atomic_store_rel()</tt>
	was done some time ago in r236456.  The
	<tt>atomic_load_acq()</tt> change was done in r285934, after
	careful review of all its uses in the kernel and user-space to
	ensure that no hidden dependency on a stronger implementation
	was left.</p>

      <p>The only reordering in memory accesses which is allowed on
	x86 is that loads may be reordered with older stores to
	different locations.  This results from the use of store
	buffers at the micro-architecural level.  So, to ensure
	sequentially consistent behavior on x86, a store/load barrier
	needs to be issued, which can be done with an MFENCE
	instruction or by any locked read-modify-write operation.  The latter
	approach is recommended by the optimization guides from Intel
	and AMD.  It was noted that careful selection of the scratch
	memory location, which is modified by the locked RMW
	operation, can reduce the cost of the barrier by avoiding false
	data dependencies.  The corresponding optimization was
	committed in r284901.</p>

      <p>The <tt>atomic(9)</tt> man page was often a cause of
	confusion due to both erroneous and ambiguous statements.  The
	most significant of these issues were addressed in changes
	r286513 and r286784.</p>

      <p>Some examples of our preemptive fixes to the misuse of
	atomics that would only become evident on weakly ordered
	machines are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A very important lockless algorithm, used in both the
	  kernel and libc, is the timekeeping functionality
	  implemented in <tt>kern/kern_tc.c</tt> and the userspace
	  <tt>__vdso_gettimeofday</tt>.  This algorithm relied on x86
	  total store order (TSO) behavior.  It was fixed in r284178
	  and r285286.</li>

	<li>The <tt>kern/kern_intr.c</tt> lockless updates to the
	  <tt>it_need</tt> indicator were corrected in r285607.</li>

	<li>An issue with
	  <tt>kern/subr_smp.c:smp_rendezvous_cpus()</tt> not
	  guaranteeing the visibility of updates done on other CPUs to
	  the caller was fixed in r285771.</li>

	<li>The <tt>pthread_once()</tt> implementation was fixed to
	  include missed barriers in r287556.</li>

      <p>Cavium&#8217;s ThunderX is a high-performance 64-bit ARMv8 CPU,
	available in configurations with up to 48 cores per package.
	ThunderX is the initial reference platform for the FreeBSD/arm64
	porting effort.</p>

      <p>Additional Semihalf-sponsored work on ThunderX support
	brought brand new features such as:</p>

      <ul>
	<li> Multi-socket operation: FreeBSD now runs on a two-node
	  ThunderX server board with a total of 96 CPU cores!</li>

	<li>Virtual Networking Interface Card driver: The VNIC driver
	  consists of 4 elements (BGX, MDIO, and Physical and Virtual
	  Functions) and is the second driver in FreeBSD to utilize
	  SR-IOV capabilities.  ThunderX is now able to use built-in
	  networking interfaces at 1&#8211;40 Gbps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Moreover, previously introduced functionalities have been
	improved and committed to HEAD.  This includes:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>PCIe drivers for both internal and external
	  controllers</li>
	<li>ITS (Interrupt Translation Services) fixes</li>
	<li>Platform-specific changes for ThunderX</li>
	<li>Various other fixes to the kernel (PCI, UMA, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The remaining features are being reviewed and will be
	integrated into HEAD soon.  However, the GENERIC kernel
	already supports and runs on ThunderX.</p>

	6220 with eight ARMv8 cores and 1GB of ram.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD has been ported to run on the HiKey with a minimal set

      <p>Numerous cleanups and fixes have been applied to the arm64
	kernel.  This includes fixes to exception handling,
	asynchronous signals, ddb, and pmap.  ddb has been updated to
	better handle accessing memory that may be unmapped.  The pmap
	code was made more complete by implementing more functions as
	needed.</p>

      <p>Further work on SMP means that FreeBSD now boots on all 48
	cores on the Cavium ThunderX platform.  This includes adding
	support for the ARM GICv3 interrupt controllers and fixing the
	memory mapping to be shareable between CPUs.</p>

      <p>The test suite has been run on both qemu and hardware.  Most
	of the test cases are passing, with around 30 tests either
	broken or failing.  Work on diagnosing the issues with the
	remaining test cases is ongoing.

      <p>RISC-V is an open source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
	designed at UC Berkeley.  It is freely available for all uses
	without requiring fees or license agreements.
	The RISC-V team intends to provide freely available
	BSD licensed CPU designs.</p>

      <p>Ruslan Bukin (University of Cambridge) now has FreeBSD booting
	to a single user shell on a RISC-V simulator.
	The porting effort started only two months ago
	and is very much a work in progress, requiring significant
	refactoring and clean up before it reaches a committable
	state.  Nonetheless, this is exceptional progress in a short
	time.  The porting effort also identified a number of
	proposed ISA improvements.</p>

      <p>The port currently uses the GNU tool chain (GCC and
	binutils), and runs on the Spike simulator.  Improved RISC-V
	support in Clang/LLVM and related tools is highly desired.</p>

      <p><tt>mandoc</tt> is a suite of tools for compiling
	<tt>mdoc</tt>, the <tt>roff</tt> macro language of choice for
	BSD manual pages.</p>

      <p><tt>mandoc</tt> is the default renderer for manpages on
	FreeBSD head.  This quarter, the <tt>apropos(1)</tt> utility was
	switched to use <tt>mandoc</tt>'s version, which offers a new
	database format (in SQLite) bringing more powerful,
	fine-grained ways to search man pages.</p>

      <p>While <tt>mandoc</tt> is very good for man pages, we also
	provide lots of other documentation in plain <tt>roff</tt>
	format.  The Heirloom toolchain is being studied to replace
	<tt>groff</tt> in base.  The Heirloom <tt>nroff</tt> toolchain
	has multiple benefits: it has very good unicode support and
	very good compatibility with <tt>groff</tt>.</p>

      <p>A great deal of work as been done testing the Heirloom
	<tt>nroff</tt> toolchain with all the <tt>roff</tt> documents
	in the base system (including man pages), and upstream has
	been very proactive in fixing reported bugs.</p>

      <p>The <tt>soelim(1)</tt> utility has been replaced with a
	BSD-licensed version which is good enough to work with all
	available <tt>roff</tt> toolchains to ease the transition.
	This version of the <tt>soelim(1)</tt> utility, originally
	written solely for FreeBSD, is now part of the <tt>mandoc</tt>
	tool suite.</p>

      <p>In coordination with Ingo Schwarze from OpenBSD, the
	<tt>col(1)</tt> utility has been cleaned up and updated to
	recognize both SUSv2-style escape-digit and BSD-style
	escape-control-char sequences in the input stream.</p>

      <p>The <tt>checknr(1)</tt> utility has been cleaned up and
	extended to support modern <tt>roff(7)</tt> macros, including
	synchronizing code from NetBSD and the Heirloom doctools
	version.</p>

      <p>Many <tt>roff</tt> fixes were made to documentation and man

      <p><tt>sesutil(8)</tt> was originally created as a more

      <p>The interface between the ABI-specific backends and the

	This prompted additional follow-on work to add support for
	more ABIs, including aarch64 and CloudABI.</p>

      <p><tt>ptrace(2)</tt> was extended to return more information
	about the currently executing system call.  This restored

	<tt>truss</tt>: knowing the correct number of arguments for

      <p>The fork-following support in <tt>truss</tt> was reworked to

      <p>GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager with many
	features, used by more than 100.000 organizations, including
	NASA and Alibaba.  It also is a very long-standing entry on
	the "Wanted Ports" list on the FreeBSD Wiki.</p>

      <p>In the last month there was steady progress, finally
	resulting in the PR for adding the new port.  In addition to
	the many dependencies Philip M. Gollucci is working on, there was
	already a large amount of work done.  Along with many new or
	updated rubygems, Rails 4.1 was resurrected.  A large group of
	committers were involved in the process and guided us through
	the various problems and pitfalls.</p>

      <p>Because of the number of dependencies &#8212; we nearly hit
	100 &#8212; making progress takes some time.  In the meantime,
	a new major version of GitLab has already been released,

      <p>The FreeBSD GNOME Team maintains the GNOME, MATE, and CINNAMON
	desktop environments and graphical user interfaces for FreeBSD.
	GNOME 3 is part of the GNU Project.  MATE is a fork of the
	GNOME 2 desktop.  CINNAMON is a desktop environment using
	GNOME 3 technologies but with a GNOME 2 look and feel.</p>

      <p>This quarter, GNOME 3.16 and MATE 1.10 were committed to the
	ports tree, followed up by some incremental improvements.  A
	chapter covering the use of USE_GNOME within individual ports'
	<tt>Makefile</tt>s was written and committed to the Porter's
	Handbook.</p>

      <p>GNOME 3.18 has been ported.  There are, however, some issues
	that need to be resolved before it can be committed to the
	ports tree.</p>

      <p>Overall, we have updated the following ports this
	quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>CMake 3.3.1 (r396266)</li>

	<li>Qt 4.8.7 (r397043)</li>

	<li>QtCreator 3.5.0 (r395935)</li>

	<li>Fixed some dependencies, typos and plists in Qt5-ports
	  (r396044-r396047), spotted by Ralf Nolden</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In our development repository, we have done the following
	work:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Updated PyQt-bindings for qt4 to 4.11.4 and added qt5
	  bindings 5.5, contributed by Guido Falsi, and modified by
	  Tobias Berner (area51)</li>

	<li>Updated qt5 to 5.5.0.  Ralf Nolden has contributed a
	  handful of useful new ports, for example
	  <tt>lang/qt5-l10n</tt> (<tt>area51/qt-5.5</tt>)</li>

	<li>The <tt>plasma5</tt> branch has been kept up to date with
	  KDE's upstream and contains ports for Frameworks 5.14.0,
	  Plasma Desktop 5.4.2 and Applications 15.08.1
	  (<tt>area51/plasma5</tt>)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>Work on getting the stuff from <tt>plasma5</tt> branch into
	  ports.  (This is a major update to nearly all KDE
	  applications, so testers are very welcome.)</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Finalize the work on PyQt5.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Port <tt>qt5-webengine</tt>.  Qt-5.5 will probably be the
	  last release shipping a <tt>www/webkit-qt5</tt> port.</p>

      <p><tt>Node.js</tt> is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript
	runtime for easily building fast, scalable network
	applications.  It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
	that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for
	data-intensive real-time applications that run across
	distributed devices.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to make it easy to install the
	modules available in the
	<a href="http://npmjs.org/" shape="rect">npm package registry</a>.</p>

      <p>Currently, the repository contains more than 100 new ports,
	in particular:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>CoffeeScript (a programming language that transcompiles to
	  JavaScript)</li>

	<li>node-gyp (allows building Node.js addons, often written in
	  C or C++)</li>

	<li>Request (a simplified HTTP client)</li>

      <p>As of the end of Q3 the ports tree holds just over
	25,000 ports, and the PR count is above 2,000.  The summer
	period saw less activity on the ports tree than during the
	previous quarter, with fewer than 7,000 commits performed by
	120 active committers.  Unfortunately, the number of problem
	reports closed also decreased significantly, with fewer than
	1,500 problem reports fixed during Q3.</p>

      <p>In Q3 several commit bits were taken in for safekeeping,
	following an inactivity period of more than 18 months
	(fluffy), or on committer's request (xmj, stefan, brix).  One
	new developer was granted a ports commit bit
	(Jason Unovitch <email>junovitch@FreeBSD.org</email>), and one returning committer
	(Babak Farrokhi) had his commit bit reinstated.</p>

      <p>On the management side, no changes were made to the
	portmgr team during Q3.</p>

      <p>On the QA side, 25 exp-runs were performed to validate
	sensitive updates or cleanups.  Amongst those, the noticeable
	changes are the update to <tt>pkg</tt> 1.6, the
	<tt>automake14</tt> removal, and several important port
	updates such as <tt>doxygen</tt> to 1.8.10, <tt>gnome3</tt> to
	3.16, <tt>cmake</tt> to 3.3.1, and the Qt4 ports to 4.8.7.
	The default jdk was also set to <tt>openjdk8</tt>.  Some
	infrastructure changes included the addition of new options
	helpers: <tt>opt_VARS</tt>, <tt>opt_VARS_OFF</tt>,
	<tt>opt_IMPLIES</tt>, and <tt>opt_PREVENTS</tt>.  Some macros
	were also removed, such as <tt>UNIQUENAME</tt> and
	<tt>LATEST_LINK</tt>.</p>

	<p>We would like to remind everyone that the ports tree is

	  So if you use ports or packages, please consider jumping in
	  and helping! This is also true for existing porters: it
	  would be great if you would consider the next step, which is
	  to share your knowledge and mentor someone more junior with
	  the ports tree internals.  And if you already do these
	  tasks, many thanks to you! </p>

      <p>The Ports Collection typically receives less attention on
	Tier-2 architectures than on Tier-1 architectures, although
	several build-runs were performed at various points in the
	past, and broken ports were marked as such at those times.</p>

      <p>Some of the Tier-2 platforms, such as PowerPC and ARM,
	have improved considerably recently, both on FreeBSD's and the
	compilers' sides, but as the tree is not rebuilt on the
	cluster very often, it was suspected that many ports are
	marked BROKEN while they in fact now build and run
	correctly.</p>

      <p>Over the past several weeks, 26 ports that were indeed
	broken on at least PowerPC had been fixed, 58 ports that were
	incorrectly marked as broken (leftovers from the old times)
	were marked as working, and fewer than 40 ports still have
	issues requiring further work.</p>

	<p>Recent work on QEMU-backed emulators and the

      <p>The FreeBSD documentation translation process has been in need
	of modernization for quite some time.  The existing process
	was just too difficult for translators to keep translations up
	to date.</p>

      <p>With help from Benedict Reuschling, Shaun McCance, Ryan
	Lortie, Hiroki Sato, and many others, the availability of a
	new PO translation system was announced in August.</p>

      <p>PO translations handle most of the overhead of the
	translation process.  Translators do not have to keep track of
	commits to the upstream English version.  The actual work of
	translating is quicker and easier.  PO editors show how much
	of the document has been translated.  If a translation is
	already available for a given string, it can be easily
	reused.</p>

      <p>Early testing has been very successful.  Most issues involve
	discovering and documenting the new processes rather than
	fixing bugs.  New translations of English documents have
	already been committed.</p>

      <p>There will certainly be additional changes and improvements,
	but the system works.  We will continue to discover how to
	share work between translation teams and the project as a
	whole.  This work will be much easier now that the initial
	hurdle of being able to use PO software has been passed.
      </p>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>Continue testing.  The system is new to us and there are
	  bound to be bugs and situations with unexpected results.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Improve documentation on using the new PO translations.
	  Much of this involves things that rarely happened with
	  the old system, like adding a completely new language
	  directory.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Add new translations for existing documents.  There is much
	  less work to create and update a translated document
	  now.  Existing and new translators are working on adding and
	  updating translations of the English documentation.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Figure out how to generate and share translation memory
	  with other members of a language team or translators outside
	  the team.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Test new PO editors like Pootle and Virtaal.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Determine a method to allow translators commit access for
	  translations.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD website has remained essentially unchanged in
	appearance for many years.  Like other legacy systems, it is
	difficult to change.  It is heavily used and therefore subject
	to non-trivial bikeshedding.</p>

      <p>The CSS shrunk the reader's font from the size they had
	requested.  It specified hardcoded font and object sizes in
	pixels.  On wide monitors, only the middle third of the screen
	was used.  Hardware has changed from what existed when
	this version of the site was created.  Screens have become
	larger and wider, and increased in resolution at the same
	time.</p>

      <p>It was time for a change.  Font sizes were set to
	percentages, with none smaller than 100%.  The width of the
	main box was changed to 90%.  Other small adjustments were
	added.  These limited changes produced a rendered site that
	better respects the reader's settings, is much easier to read,
	and shows more information.</p>

      <p>Although no content changed, the appearance was so different
	that some viewers thought we had redesigned the site.  It is
	gratifying to know that so many people are using it.  We would
	also like to thank people for the response, which was
	overwhelmingly positive and hardly bikesheddy at all.</p>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>Fix other outdated assumptions in the CSS.  Alternately,
	  rework the entire site.  However, that is a much more
	  complex and ambitious project than it might seem.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD includes several programs that work with file system
	hierarchy descriptions in the <tt>mtree(5)</tt> format.  These
	descriptions, also called specifications, have a broad range
	of uses, from automatically creating directory structures to
	security auditing.</p>

      <p> Each of the programs, namely <tt>mtree</tt>,
	<tt>bsdtar</tt>, <tt>install</tt>, and <tt>makefs</tt>, has
	its own implementation of the mtree format.  This not only
	adds maintenance overhead, but also makes interoperability
	difficult, as each of the implementations only supports a
	limited subset of the format.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project was to create a new
	<tt>libmtree</tt> library, implementing everything the mtree
	format has to offer, and wrapping it with an expressive API
	which all the listed programs can use.  We also wanted
	<tt>libmtree</tt> to be portable, as one of the major users of
	the mtree format is <tt>libarchive</tt>, the library
	implementing most of <tt>bsdtar</tt>.</p>

      <p>Currently, the library is functionally complete, ready to be
	downloaded and receive everyone's attention.  We have also
	decided to bundle the <tt>mtree</tt> program along with it.
	The bundled <tt>mtree</tt> has also been modified for better
	portability.</p>

      <p>The project included modifying <tt>libarchive</tt>,
	<tt>install</tt> and <tt>makefs</tt> to use libmtree.  These
	modified versions are also available.</p>

      <p>Please see the Wiki page for more information, download
	locations, and an example of using the <tt>libmtree</tt> API.

      <p>The aim of this project is to design and implement
	infrastructure to validate that a number of the network
	stack's multiqueue behaviours are functioning as expected.</p>

      <p>At present, most of this project has been implemented.  It
	mainly consists of two parts:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>A general mechanism to collect the per-ring per-cpu
	  statistics that can be used by all NIC drivers, and
	  extensions to <tt>netstat(1)</tt> to report these
	  statistics.</li>

	<li>A suite of network stack behavior testing programs that
	  consists of:

	  <ul>
	    <li>a virtual multiqueue ethernet interface
	      (<tt>vme</tt>)</li>

	    <li>a UDP packet generator based on <tt>vme</tt></li>

	    <li>a UDP server based on <tt>socket(2)</tt></li>

	    <li>a TCP client based on <tt>lwip</tt> and
	      <tt>vme</tt></li>

	    <li>a TCP server based on <tt>socket(2)</tt></li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The FreeBSD bootloader has used Ficl 3 for quite some time.
	This project was intended to update the version of Ficl in use
	to Ficl 4.  Ficl 4 is not only faster but also has a smaller
	memory footprint, both being important advantages for a
	bootloader.</p>

      <p>As part of the Google Summer of Code program, I worked on
	importing the Ficl 4 sources to get a bootloader running Ficl
	4. The first half of the summer consisted of setting up my
	test environment, as well as arranging the sources in the tree
	properly and modifying the build files to point to the new
	locations.  Once that was complete, the sources had to be
	modified to build correctly and to add back in some of the
	FreeBSD-specific parts from Ficl 3.  Unfortunately, after all
	those tasks were completed, a few bugs in the Ficl project
	were discovered that delayed the bootloader update, so it is
	not finished.  The Illumos project has faced similar issues
	with Ficl 4 so I received some good tips from them, but since
	school has started back up I have not been able to put much
	work into fixing the bugs.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
	dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and
	community worldwide.  Funding comes from individual and
	corporate donations and is used to fund and manage development
	projects, conferences and developer summits, and provide
	travel grants to FreeBSD developers.  The Foundation purchases
	hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure and
	publishes FreeBSD white papers and marketing material to promote,
	educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD Project.  The Foundation
	also represents the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts,
	license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require
	a recognized legal entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD last
	quarter:</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison and Deb Goodkin attended OSCON to promote
	FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Robert Watson organized and ran the Cambridge FreeBSD Developer
	Summit 2015 ("BSDCam").  We provided travel grants to two FreeBSD
	developers to attend the summit.  Three Foundation board/staff
	members attended too.</p>

      <p>George V. Neville-Neil attended the ARM Partner Meeting where he met with 15
	silicon and systems vendors to present the unique traits and
	qualities of FreeBSD and work on setting up partnerships with the
	companies building and deploying ARM hardware.</p>

      <p>George and Robert Watson collaborated in Cambridge on
	developing further FreeBSD-based teaching material at
	undergraduate and masters levels.  Part of this project was
	funded by the Foundation.</p>

      <p>George planned and ran the DevSummit at vBSDCon 2015.</p>

      <p>We were  proud to be a sponsor of
	<url href="http://www.verisign.com/en_US/internet-technology-news/verisign-events/vbsdcon/index.xhtml">vBSDCon
	  2015</url>, Sept 11-13 in Washington DC.  George V. Neville-Neil and
	Ed Maste presented "Supporting a BSD Project" at the
	conference.  Dru Lavigne, Glen Barber, George V. Neville-Neil, and Ed Maste
	attended and represented the Foundation at both vBSDCon and
	the FreeBSD Developer Summit that preceded it.  We had many
	people stop by our table to make a donation, and it was
	another great opportunity to talk and work with people
	face-to-face.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Blain and John Baldwin promoted the Foundation and FreeBSD at
	the SNIA 2015 Storage Developer Conference, in Santa Clara,
	California, Sept 21-24.  The Foundation was also a
	sponsor.</p>

      <p>We sponsored Andy Turner to attend Linaro Connect in San
	Francisco, Sept 21-25.</p>

      <p>Ed Maste, our project development director, attended the
	X.Org Developer's Conference (XDC) in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

      <p>We sponsored the 2015 nginx Conference and sent FreeBSD
	community member John Baldwin.</p>

      <p>George Neville-Neil continued planning the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201511VendorDevSummit">2015
	  Silicon Valley Vendor Summit</url>, including securing
	the venue.</p>

      <p>Benedict Reuschling and Erwin Lansing helped plan and organize the EuroBSDCon
	FreeBSD Developer Summit.  This included setting up the working
	groups, securing the venue, and getting the T-shirts made.</p>

      <p>Benedict helped organize, and he and Dru Lavigne participated
	in the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201507DevSummit">FreeBSD
	Hackathon</url> in the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany.  It was a
	successful weekend of fixing bugs and collaborating with
	others.</p>

      <p>Dru Lavigne taught a FreeBSD class in Berlin, Germany July
	29-31.</p>

      <p>We were a sponsor of
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/index.cfm">womENcourage
	  2015</url>, in Uppsala Sweden, Sept 24-26.  Dru was the
	moderator for a panel on
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/panel2.cfm">Open Source
	  as a Career Path</url>.  All the panelists were FreeBSD
	contributors including Dan Langille, Allan Jude, Benedict
	Reuschling, and Deb Goodkin.  We also had a table at the job
	fair and talked to a lot of students and professors about the
	benefits of working on FreeBSD as an alternative to an
	internship, teaching about FreeBSD in university classes, and
	hosting FreeBSD events at their schools.  Dan taught a workshop
	on How to Contribute to an Open Source project.  Deb
	participated in this workshop and started a discussion on
	offering a similar workshop at BSD and non-BSD conferences.
	The workshop would be titled "How to Contribute to FreeBSD", and
	participants would learn how to contribute documentation to
	the Project.</p>

      <p>We continued to publish our monthly newsletters, keeping the
	community informed on what we are doing, including event
	recaps, testimonials, project updates, and upcoming events.
	We received testimonials from Microsoft, NYCBus, and
	ScaleEngine.  We also continued to approach companies to
	provide us with testimonials to help promote their use of
	FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison rebooted the Faces of FreeBSD series and is
	working with FreeBSD contributors on writing their stories.
	She continued to produce more FreeBSD Swag and literature to
	promote FreeBSD, as well as advocating for FreeBSD over our social
	channels and with new partnerships.</p>

      <p>We reached our 2015 goal of 10,000 FreeBSD Journal subscribers,
	and we published a new Open Journal article on our website, to
	help promote the Journal.  We also started offering a new
	subscription bundle, where you can buy all the 2014 issues.
	The July/August issue was published.</p>

      <p>Justin T. Gibbs began teaching a semester-long FreeBSD class at a middle school
	in Boulder, Colorado.  We are using the BeagleBone Black (BBB)
	to run FreeBSD connected to Macs and PCs.  We have received a lot
	of support, both internally, and from the Project, to get the
	FreeBSD images to work on the BBB with the Macs and PCs.  It has
	been a great collaborative effort with community members, and
	this will help future classes in being able to support
	inexpensive platforms for teaching FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Work continued on creating a FreeBSD curriculum for a half day
	workshop.  Hopefully this will be available in late
	Spring.</p>

      <p>We provided legal support for the Project including granting
	trademark permission for some users and companies who
	requested permission to put the FreeBSD logo on their websites
	and marketing literature.</p>

      <p>We met with commercial users to get their input on what
	they would like to see supported in FreeBSD.  We also do this to
	help connect FreeBSD developers with commercial users to help
	facilitate collaboration.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD Foundation employee and Release Engineer Glen Barber was
	extremely busy during this quarter, working on a number of
	exciting areas of the FreeBSD Project.  Some of the highlights
	include:

	<ul>
	  <li>Code cleanup and bug fixes to several parts of the
	    release build code, and finishing adding support for
	    automatically uploading cloud provider images, which was
	    merged to the stable/10 branch before the code freeze.
	    The 10.2-RELEASE cycle spanned a 9-week timeframe overall,
	    starting from the code slush.</li>

	  <li> With the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team, released two
	    BETA builds and three RC builds for the 10.2-RELEASE
	    cycle, with the final release announced mid-August,
	    two weeks ahead of the original schedule.</li>

	  <li>With the FreeBSD Cluster Administrators Team, assisted with
	    a number of general updates and enhancements to the FreeBSD
	    infrastructure.</li>

      <p>ZFSguru started as a front-end to ZFS but has since grown
	into a multifunctional server appliance with its own unique
	features.  While the project is still in early development, it
	already offers multiple unique features not found in other
	projects.  Unlike similar projects, nothing is stripped away
	from the base operating system, meaning ZFSguru behaves as a
	normal FreeBSD installation and thus is very versatile.  The
	web-interface is designed to unite both novice and advanced
	users, providing both very easy to use basic functionality as
	well as features to be appreciated by more experienced users.
	The modular nature of the project combats the danger of bloat,
	whilst still allowing extended functionality to be easily
	deployed.</p>

      <p>On the 15th of August, version 0.3 of ZFSguru was released.
	Some highlights of the new version:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>New build infrastructure allows for frequent releases of
	  system images and services in a semi-automated way.</li>

	<li>A new GuruDB database allows for a growing number of
	  system images and servers, and provides good caching to
	  accelerate pages.</li>

	<li>The installation procedure was given a major
	  overhaul.</li>

	<li>In addition to the LiveCD, USB images are now available.
	  The USB image supports both legacy MBR bootcode and UEFI
	  boot.</li>

	<li>Many libraries in the web-interface have been
	  overhauled, in addition to many other additions to the
	  web interface.</li>

	<li>Many improvements were made to optional add-on services,
	  such as the new Gnome 3 graphical environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other progress made in the months July, August, and
	September:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>System image builds 001, 002, 003, and 004 have been
	  released for all supported branches: 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
	  (-STABLE), and 11.0 (-CURRENT).</li>

	<li>Work on the 0.4 web-interface has started, which focuses
	  on improving network support in the web-interface.</li>

	<li>Work on a new visual theme for the web-interface has
	  started.  The new interface is likely to be included in the
	  upcoming 0.4 release.</li>

	<li>A new master server is being prepared, which is likely to
	  be operational in December.</li>

	<li>A new website is being worked on, to be launched the first
	  of January, 2016.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Open tasks:</h3><ol><li>
	<p>The new Gnome 3 desktop does not work for everyone
	  and still has issues.  Anyone capable of diagnosing these
	  issues can give the Gnome 3 LiveCD a try.  Please see
	  the linked forum thread for more information.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>Several ports fail to compile with our own build
	  infrastructure, and require bug reports in order to get
	  them fixed upstream.</p>
      </li><li>
	<p>A 'State of the Project 2015' is due in Q4, providing an
	  overview for future development of the project.</p>

=== PackageKit backend for FreeBSD pkg

Contact: Gleb Popov <arrowd@FreeBSD.org>

PackageKit is a small D-Bus daemon program that serves as a backend for "application store" type of apps - most notably Plasma Discover and Gnome Software Center.
The latest PackageKit release features a libpkg backend, which means that you can now use PackageKit-enabled programs on FreeBSD to manage software.
Plasma Discover is already switched to using PackageKit, so you will get it working out of the box once you update your ports/packages.

If you observe any crashes or bugs in PackageKit please let me know by link:https://github.com/PackageKit/PackageKit/issues[opening an issue upstream].
If you are interested in contributing, there is a lot of work to do too!

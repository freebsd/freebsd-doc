Here is the first 2024 status report, with 21 entries.

The New Year brings us many new interesting projects, such as the new `libsys` that separates system calls from `libc` and `libpthread` or work on a graphical installer for FreeBSD, which will help making our OS more user-friendly.
Of course, the usual projects keep going on, such as the work on cloud-init, OpenStack, or the GCC ports.
As usual our main teams share their progress with us.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

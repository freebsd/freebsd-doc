The OpenStack on FreeBSD project aims to seamlessly integrate OpenStack cloud infrastructure with the FreeBSD operating system.
It uses FreeBSD's unique features while ensuring compatibility with OpenStack standards.

In the first quarter of 2024, we made significant progress on the OpenStack on FreeBSD project.
This included submitting a proposal for BSDCan 2024 and attending AsiaBSDCon 2024 to link:https://papers.freebsd.org/2024/asiabsdcon/chang-towards-a-robust-freebsd-based-cloud-porting-openstack-components/[share our porting experiences and gain exposure for the project].
The feedback received at AsiaBSDCon was particularly valuable and helped in refining the project's direction.
During this period, we also reviewed the project's phase 1 tasks and made necessary adjustments.
We also planned for phases 2 and 3, aligning them with the project's long-term goals.
One technical achievement was verifying the functionality of bhyve serial console over TCP, an important part of the project's infrastructure.
Additionally, we created a link:https://asciinema.org/a/647308[demo video] showcasing the project's progress and features.

Looking ahead, our focus for the next quarter includes confirming the feasibility of implementing FreeBSD privilege-management user space tools leveraging man:mac[4] and man:priv[9], simplifying installation steps by transitioning to FreeBSD ports, and porting OpenStack Ironic to FreeBSD.
These tasks will enhance the project's capabilities and compatibility.

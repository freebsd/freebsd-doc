In the first quarter of 2024, we worked with the project contributors and developers to address their testing requirements.
Concurrently, we collaborated with external projects and companies to enhance their products by testing more on FreeBSD.

Important completed tasks:

* With help from clusteradm, the host running test VMs had disk and memory upgraded by reusing the parts of decommissioned machines.
* Update the build environment of stable/13 jobs to 13.3-RELEASE.
* Turn i386 build on main branch to use cross build on amd64.

Work in progress tasks:

* Merging link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D43786[]
* Merging link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D36257[]
* Adding new hardware purchased by the FreeBSD Foundation to the CI cluster
* Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing and pull/merge-request based system (to support the link:https://gitlab.com/bsdimp/freebsd-workflow[workflow working group])
  * Proof of concept system is in progress.
* Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release artifacts as release engineering does, starting with snapshot builds
* Simplifying CI/test environment setting up for contributors and developers
* Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental jobs on it
* Redesigning the hardware test lab and adding more hardware for testing

Open or queued tasks:

* Collecting and sorting link:https://hackmd.io/@FreeBSD-CI/freebsd-ci-todo[CI tasks and ideas]
* Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests
* Implementing use of bare-metal hardware to run test suites
* Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT
* Planning to run ztest tests
* Helping more software get FreeBSD support in its CI pipeline (Wiki pages: link:https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/3rdPartySoftwareCI[3rdPartySoftwareCI], link:https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/HostedCI[HostedCI])
* Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

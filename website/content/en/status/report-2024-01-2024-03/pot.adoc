Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].
Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

During this quarter, there were no new link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot[Pot] releases.

Potluck saw quite some activity though.
Not only have the images been rebuilt for FreeBSD 14, but also the new link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/adminer[Adminer] container has been submitted by first-time contributor link:https://github.com/Sidicer[Sidicer].
Additionally a large number of additional features, updates and fixes have been committed to containers like link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/haproxy-consul[HAProxy-Consul], link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/grafana[Grafana], link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/postgresql-patroni[PostgreSQL-Patroni], or link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/prometheus[Prometheus].

For the link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/mastodon-s3[Mastodon container], a link:https://honeyguide.eu/posts/run-your-own-mastodon-server/[blog post] has been published explaining how to use it to run your own instance.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

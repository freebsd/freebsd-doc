The goal of this project is to improve FreeBSD's ability to execute unmodified man:linux[4] binaries.

As of gitref:22dca7acf775[repository=src], xattr system calls are implemented.
That makes it possible to use Linux rsync.

As of gitref:bbe017e0415a[repository=src], ioprio system calls are implemented.
That makes it possible to debootstrap Ubuntu 23.04.

Here is the third 2023 status report, with 32 entries.

This is the summer quarter and thus it includes many interesting news from Google Summer of Code.
Of course, we also have our usual team reports and many projects share with us their latest news.
Much important work has been done for the first release of FreeBSD 14.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

==== What is mfsBSD?

"mfsBSD is a toolset to create small-sized but full-featured mfsroot based distributions of FreeBSD that store all files in memory (MFS) [Memory File System] and load from hard drive, USB storage device, or optical medium.
It can be used for a variety of purposes, including diskless systems, recovery partitions and remotely overwriting other operating systems."

mailto:mm@FreeBSD.org[Martin Matu≈°ka] is the creator of mfsBSD.
He is also author of the original (2009) link:https://people.freebsd.org/~mm/mfsbsd/mfsbsd.pdf[mfsBSD white paper], from which the excerpt above is taken.
Upstream mfsBSD is maintained in the link:https://github.com/mmatuska/mfsbsd[repository on GitHub].

==== Purpose of this Project

This project integrates mfsBSD into the FreeBSD release tool set, creating an additional target of mfsBSD images ([.filename]#.img# and [.filename]#.iso# files) in [.filename]#/usr/src/release/Makefile#.
Prior to integration, mfsBSD only existed outside the FreeBSD release tool chain, and only -RELEASE versions were produced.

With this project, mfsBSD images will be available at the official FreeBSD release page.
You will also be able to build mfsBSD yourself by invoking `cd /usr/src/release && make release WITH_MFSBSD=1`, which will then create [.filename]#mfsbsd-se.img# and [.filename]#mfsbsd-se.iso# at [.filename]#/usr/obj/usr/src/${ARCH}/release/#.

==== Changes from last quarter

The code is ready, and is currently under review.

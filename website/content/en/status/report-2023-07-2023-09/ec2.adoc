FreeBSD is available on both x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.
Work continues to ensure that upcoming instance types will be supported.

Weekly FreeBSD snapshots now include experimental ZFS-root AMIs for 14.0 and 15.0.
This change will be present in FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

Work is underway to start publishing experimental "cloud-init" AMIs.
This is expected to arrive in time for FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

This work is supported by Colin's FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon.

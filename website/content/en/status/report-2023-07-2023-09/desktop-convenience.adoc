The package:sysutils/desktop-installer[] port, available for over a decade now, quickly configures a bare FreeBSD system with any desktop environment or window manager.
However, the FreeBSD base and ports collection has been missing some common features that end users expect from a desktop OS.

The desktop-installer battery monitor script has been enhanced to display popup notifications at various levels of charge/discharge.

package:deskutils/qmediamanager[], in conjunction with package:sysutils/devd-mount[] and package:sysutils/npmount[], mounts inserted media upon notification from devd, and displays a popup window offering the user options to show filesystem information, open a file manager, reformat, copy a disk image to the device, or unmount.
It provides a convenient and secure way to work with external media such as USB sticks.

A fourth new port -- package:deskutils/freebsd-update-notify[] -- displays a popup when new base updates are available, or when a configurable time limit has elapsed.
If the user chooses to proceed with updates, the entire system is updated (packages, ports, and base) with man:auto-update-system[1] (a feature of package:sysutils/auto-admin[]).

These new tools bring the FreeBSD desktop experience a step closer to the convenience of the most popular desktop operating systems.

The tools are effectively prototypes, stable and reliable, but in need of review.
Feedback from users regarding default behavior and configuration options will be appreciated.

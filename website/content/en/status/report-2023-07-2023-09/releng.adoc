The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the third quarter of the year, the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team started work on the upcoming 14.0-RELEASE cycle.
As of this writing, BETA3 had been released, with BETA4 to follow shortly after.

The Release Engineering Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the *main* and *stable/13* branches.

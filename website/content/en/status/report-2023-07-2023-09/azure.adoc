In this quarter, we have worked mainly on ARM64 architecture support and building and publishing both UFS and ZFS based images to link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/share-gallery-community[Azure community gallery].
There are some testing images available in the project's testing public gallery, named `FreeBSDCGTest-d8a43fa5-745a-4910-9f71-0c9da2ac22bf`:

* FreeBSD-CURRENT-testing
* FreeBSD-CURRENT-gen2-testing
* FreeBSD-CURRENT-arm64-testing
* FreeBSD-CURRENT-zfs-testing
* FreeBSD-CURRENT-zfs-gen1-testing

To use them, when creating a virtual machine:

. In `Select an Image` step, choose `Community Images` in `Other items`
. Search `FreeBSD`

We are aiming to provide all those images for 14.0-RELEASE.

Work in progress tasks:

* Automating the image building and publishing process and merge to src/release/.
* Building and publishing all supported VM images to Azure Marketplace
* Building and publishing snapshot builds to Azure community gallery

The above tasks are sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation, with resources provided by Microsoft.

Wei Hu and Souradeep Chakrabarti have fixed several critical bugs in arm64:

* https://bugs.freebsd.org/267654
* https://bugs.freebsd.org/272461
* https://bugs.freebsd.org/272666

The root cause was identified and fixed in link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=e7a9817b8d328dda04069b65944ce2ed6f54c6f0[e7a9817b8d32: Hyper-V: vmbus: implementat bus_get_dma_tag in vmbus]

And continue working on improving Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) support.

Open tasks:

* Update FreeBSD related doc at link:https://learn.microsoft.com[Microsoft Learn]
* Support FreeBSD in link:https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/pipelines/[Azure Pipelines]
* Update link:https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/azure-agent[Azure agent port] to the latest version
* Upstream link:https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent/pull/1892[local modifications of Azure agent]

GitLab is a DevOps Platform.
It brings velocity with confidence, security without sacrifice, and visibility into DevOps success.

Version 16.3 is now available on FreeBSD: please check the package:www/gitlab-ce[] port.
The upgrade is very important as version 16.3 will be required for all further upgrades.
You cannot upgrade to 16.4 if you have not upgraded to 16.3 before.

Documentation for installation can be found at link:https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/install/16.3-freebsd.md?ref_type=heads[].
Documentation for upgrading is available at https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.1-16.3-freebsd.md?ref_type=heads[].

I will wait for the upgrade to 16.4 (which will be released around 20.9. or 22.9., not sure) till quarterly branch 2023Q4 is created, to avoid breaking systems of users which are not in main branch for packages.
Gitlab users should always use main branch, as described in the installation manual.

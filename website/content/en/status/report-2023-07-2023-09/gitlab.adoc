GitLab is a DevOps platform.
It brings velocity with confidence, security without sacrifice, and visibility into DevOps success.

Version 16.3 is now available on FreeBSD: please check the package:www/gitlab-ce[] port.
The upgrade is very important as version 16.3 will be required for all further upgrades.
Upgrade to 16.4 is only possible from GitLab 16.3.

Documentation for installation can be found at link:https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/install/16.3-freebsd.md?ref_type=heads[].
Documentation for upgrading is available at https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.1-16.3-freebsd.md?ref_type=heads[].

I will wait for the upgrade to 16.4 (which will be released around 20.9. or 22.9., not sure) until ports _quarterly_ branch 2023Q4 is created, to avoid breaking systems that do not use the main branch (_latest_).
GitLab users should always choose the main branch, as described in the installation manual.

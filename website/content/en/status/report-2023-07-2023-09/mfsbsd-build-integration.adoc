==== What is mfsBSD?

"mfsBSD is a toolset to create small-sized but full-featured mfsroot based distributions of FreeBSD that store all files in memory (MFS) [Memory File System] and load from hard drive, USB storage device, or optical medium.
It can be used for a variety of purposes, including diskless systems, recovery partitions and remotely overwriting other operating systems."

mailto:mm@FreeBSD.org[Martin Matuska] is the creator of mfsBSD, and he is also the author of the original link:https://people.freebsd.org/~mm/mfsbsd/mfsbsd.pdf[mfsBSD white paper], which is where the excerpt above was taken from.
The upstream mfsBSD is maintained at the link:https://github.com/mmatuska/mfsbsd[GitHub mfsBSD repository].

==== Purpose of this Project

This project integrates mfsBSD into the FreeBSD release tool set, creating an additional target of mfsBSD images ([.filename]#.img# and [.filenmae]#.iso# files) into the [.filename]#/usr/src/release/Makefile#.
Until now, mfsBSD only existed outside the FreeBSD release tool chain, and only the -release versions have been produced.
With this project, mfsBSD images will be available at the official FreeBSD release page, and you will also be able to build mfsBSD yourself by invoking `cd /usr/src/release && make release WITH_MFSBSD=1`, which will then create [.filename]#mfsbsd-se.img# and [.filename]#mfsbsd-se.iso# at [.filename]#/usr/obj/usr/src/${ARCH}/release/#.

==== Changes from last quarter

The code is ready, and is currently under review.

Wifibox is an experimental project for exploring the ways of deploying
a virtualized Linux guest to drive wireless networking cards on the
FreeBSD host system.  There have been guides to describe how to set
this up manually, and Wifibox aims to implement those ideas as a
single easy-to-use software package.

- It uses ``bhyve(8)`` to run the embedded Linux system.  This helps
  to achieve low resource footprint.  It requires an x64 CPU with I/O
  MMU (AMD-Vi, Intel VT-d), ~150 MB physical memory, and some disk
  space available for the guest virtual disk image, which can be even
  ~30 MB only in certain cases.  It works with FreeBSD 12 and later,
  some cards may require FreeBSD 13 though.

- The guest is constructed using https://alpinelinux.org/[Alpine
  Linux], a security-oriented, lightweight distribution based on
  https://www.musl-libc.org/[musl libc] and
  https://busybox.net/[BusyBox], with some custom extensions and
  patches imported from https://archlinux.org/[Arch Linux] most
  notably.  It is shipped with a number of diagnostic tools for better
  management of the hardware in use.  The recent version features
  Linux 6.1, but Linux 6.5 is also available as an alternative.

- Configuration files are shared with the host system. The guest uses
  ``wpa_supplicant(8)`` or ``hostapd(8)`` (depending on the
  configuration) so it is possible to import the host's
  ``wpa_supplicant.conf(5)`` or ``hostapd.conf(5)`` file without any
  changes.

- When configured, ``wpa_supplicant(8)`` and ``hostapd(8)`` control
  sockets could be exposed by the guest, which enables use of related
  utilities directly from the host, such as ``wpa_cli(8)`` or
  ``wpa_gui(8)`` from the ``net/wpa_supplicant_gui`` package, or
  ``hostapd_cli(8)``.

- Everything is shipped in a single package that can be easily
  installed and removed.  This comes with an ``rc(8)`` system service
  that automatically launches the guest on boot and stops it on
  shutdown.

- It can be configured to forward IPv6 traffic, which is currently an
  experimental option but turned on by default.

Wifibox has been mainly tested with Intel chipsets, and it has shown
great performance and stability.  Therefore it might serve as an
interim solution until the Intel Wireless support becomes mature
enough.  It was confirmed that Wifibox works with Atheros, Realtek,
and Mediatek chipsets too, and feedback is more than welcome about
others.  Broadcom chips (that are often found in MacBook Pros) can
also work, but there are known stability issues.

FreeBSD provides the Ports Collection to give users and administrators a simple way to install applications.
It is possible to configure a port before the building and installation.
The command 'make config' uses package:ports-mgmt/dialog4ports[] and package:ports-mgmt/portconfig[] to set up a port interactively via a Text User Interface.

Unfortunately screen readers perform poorly with TUI; it is a well-known accessibility problem.
FreeBSD provides tens of thousands of ports; port configuration is a key feature, but it is inaccessible to users with vision impairment.

PortOptsCLI (Port Options CLI) is a new utility for setting the port options via a Command Line Interface.
Properly PortOptsCLI provides commands to navigate the configuration lists (checklists and/or radiolists) and set up their items interactively.
It is also suitable for a speech synthesizer; currently it is tested with package:accessibility/orca[].
PortOptsCLI can be installed via the package:SECTION/portoptscli[] package or the package:ports-mgmt/portoptscli[] port.

Tips and new ideas are welcome.
If possible, send reports to the FreeBSD Accessibility mailing list, to share and to track discussions in a public place.

We are thrilled to unveil the inaugural component of the BSD Cafe project!

Months ago, when I first registered the link:https://bsd.cafe/[bsd.cafe] domain, I envisioned a themed bar where friends, acquaintances, and patrons could gather for casual conversations about ++*++BSD systems, Linux, and open-source technology.
Just like any bar, our discussions can encompass a wide array of topics, all while maintaining a spirit of mutual respect.

BSD Cafe is poised to become a hub for a variety of tools and services, all powered by ++*++BSD.

Our initial offering is a brand-new instance of link:https://joinmastodon.org/[Mastodon] (open-source
microblogging software and service), serving as a gateway to the fediverse -- a federation of services, many of which use the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub[ActivityPub] decentralised social networking protocol.
Registration is now open.
The server operates under clearly defined guidelines that promote positive conduct and unequivocally prohibit any form of hate.
Inclusiveness, respect, and constructive dialogue stand as the cornerstones of this instance.

Our primary server is currently hosted in Finland on a small VM, running on FreeBSD.
Services are partitioned into VNET jails, interconnected within a local area network through a dedicated bridge.
Additionally, we implement a VPN system and have the flexibility to migrate individual jails to more robust machines.

For multimedia data and cache hosting, we employ a separate physical server (also FreeBSD-based, within a jail), fronted by Cloudflare.
The goal here is to cache and geodistribute data, effectively reducing network congestion on the main VPS.

Our reverse proxy (frontend), mail server, media server, and the instance itself are all accessible via IPv6.

At its inception, this Mastodon instance was devoid of preloaded content.
Our intention is for it to grow organically, based on the interests and followers of its users.
At this stage, we have refrained from preemptive blocks.
We strongly encourage users to promptly report anything that they believe requires attention.

We invite you to join us at link:https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/[] in order to cultivate a community that values constructive interactions and embraces inclusiveness -- a secure and serene space meant for all.

Furthermore, we have established a website at link:https://wiki.bsd.cafe/[], which will provide an overview of our tools, services, rules, uptime, and more.

Recently, a Miniflux installation has been performed, so the BSD Cafe users can use it as a personal RSS Feed Reader.

Currently, our document translation process involves using Weblate and direct editing of the link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/[doc] repository.
We acknowledge that this process can be somewhat cumbersome, so we are striving to offer a more convenient alternative, similar to what the wiki community does.
Introducing the Online Document Editor and Man Page Editor, a user-friendly, WYSIWYG static site designed for translating documents and man pages.
Our goal is to consolidate all translation functions within a single platform, making the translation process as straightforward as possible.

However, we still require assistance with these two projects, as follows:

1. The Document editor and Man page editor were developed using simple JavaScript.
We are seeking a web developer to assess the code's efficiency since I (Yan-Hao Wang) am not well-versed in front-end development.

2. We are also seeking a cybersecurity developer to assist us in identifying and addressing security issues within these two projects.
This is crucial to ensure the secure hosting of these projects and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.

3. As there is currently no existing JavaScript library to render mandoc, I had to create my own.
However, there are still some concealed errors during the editing process.
We are in need of a JavaScript developer to help rectify these rendering issues.

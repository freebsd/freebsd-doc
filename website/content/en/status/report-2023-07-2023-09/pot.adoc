Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During this quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/pull/274[Pot 0.15.6] was finished, adding custom man:pf[4] rule configuration hooks.

Additionally, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/nomad-pot-driver/releases/tag/v0.9.1[Nomad Pot Driver 0.9.1] that allows setting Pot attributes in Nomad job descriptions was released.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

Quite a few new container images were made available, e.g. a link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/caddy-s3-nomad[Caddy S3 proxy], a link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/mastodon-s3[Mastodon instance], and a link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/redis-single[Redis container].
In total there are now 50 containers available that can either be downloaded as ready-made images at link:https://potluck.honeyguide.net/[the Potluck image registry], if you trust our build process, or that you can build yourself from the Pot flavour files stored in the link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck[Potluck GitHub repository].

The July/August 2023 edition of the FreeBSD Journal contains Luca's link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pizzamiglio.pdf[Jail Orchestration with pot and nomad] article, explaining how to use Pot and Potluck together with Nomad to orchestrate containers on multiple hosts.

Last but not least, a patch (gitref:90b1184d93c8[repository=ports]) added build cluster support to the package:devel/sccache[] port.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

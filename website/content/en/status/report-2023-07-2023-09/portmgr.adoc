The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened this quarter.

According to INDEX, there are currently 34,600 ports in the Ports Collection.
There are currently 3,000 open ports PRs of which some 730 are unassigned.
There were 11,454 commits by 130 committers on the main branch, and 828 commits by 37 committers on the 2023Q3 branch.
Compared to the previous quarter, this means a slight decrease in the number of unassigned PRs, a 10% increase in the number of commits on the main branch, but also fewer backports to the quarterly branch.
The number of ports also grew slightly.

We welcomed Joel Bodenmann (jbo@) as a new ports committer, granted a ports commit bit to mizhka@ who was already a src committer, and took the commit bits of knu@ and uqs@ in for safe-keeping after a year of inactivity.

portgmr@ discussed and worked on:

* Progress on sub-packages 
** a lightning talk was given by pizzamig@ at EuroBSDCon
* Overhauling some parts of the ports tree
** `LIB_DEPENDS`, `PREFIX`, `MANPREFIX`, `MANPATH`.

Support for FreeBSD 13.1 was removed from the ports tree, as it reached its end-of-life on August 1st.

==== Infrastructure

* `USES` for `ebur128` and `guile` were added
* Default versions for Mono, Perl, and PostgreSQL were updated to respectively 5.20, 5.34, and 15
* Default versions for `ebur128`, `guile`, and `pycryptography` were added at respectively "rust", 2.2, and "rust".

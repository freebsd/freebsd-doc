We are attempting to update the drm-kmod graphics drivers to the Linux 5.7 code, based on the existing drm-kmod 5.5-wip branch.

Right now, the current version of drm-kmod do not support newer GPU such as Intel's Tiger Lake/Iris Xe, used on laptops such as the 2020 HP Spectre x360.
This prevents us from supporting accelerated graphics on newer hardware containing Intel or AMD GPUs.

Some tasks have already been completed, including:

* amdgpu bring-up
* i915kms console bring-up

Some tasks need to be completed, including:

* i915kms Xorg bring-up (currently pagefaults on `remap_io_sg()` page address)
* amdgpu VA-API bring-up
* radeonkms bring-up

We welcome help for the incomplete tasks, especially from users wanting to use newer hardware (or support FreeBSD-as-a-desktop in general).

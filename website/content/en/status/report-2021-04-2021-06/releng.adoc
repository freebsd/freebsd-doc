The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Release Engineering Team completed work on the 13.0-RELEASE cycle, the first release from the stable/13 branch.
During the release cycle, one additional BETA build and two additional RC builds were added to the schedule, however the release cycle went smoothly, overall.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds were released for the *main*, *stable/13*, and *stable/12* branches.
Development snapshot builds for *stable/11* will no longer be available.

Thank you to all that have helped test the 13.0 builds up until this point and have reported issues.
As always, we strive for quality over quantity.

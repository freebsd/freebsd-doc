=== NXP DPAA driver

Contact: Jakub Klama <jakub@conclusive.pl>

The Conclusive Engineering team is working on support for the NXP Data Path Acceleration Architecture (link:https://www.nxp.com/files-static/training_pdf/VFTF09_AN129.pdf[DPAA]) present in the NXP QorIQ Layerscape ARMv8 SoCs as well as PowerPC-based QorIQ SoCs.

This work is focused on providing a clean-room, native implementation of DPAA driver and all of its associated components such as BMan, QMan, FMan and mEMAC for ARM targets such as LS1046A.

First functional version of the driver with support for the 1Gbps and 10Gbps MACs should be completed in the 2021 Q3 timeframe.

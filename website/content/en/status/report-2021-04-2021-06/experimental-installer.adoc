bsdinstall is FreeBSD's current installer.
It is a terminal application with an unwieldy interface, and it asks some very obscure questions that are hard to understand for ordinary users.
So, the purpose of this project is to create a graphical installer for FreeBSD that has a more streamlined interface, and to improve other aspects of the FreeBSD installation process.

The experimental installer uses a web front-end: a web server runs locally from the installation media, and the user configures their install by filling out web forms on a browser also running on the installation media.
A Web interface is flexible and accessible, so it suits an installer well.
This interface can also support remote installs, where the server runs on the target and the install is configured through some other machine, though I have not done much work here.

The installer also aims to have a modular design, where the user configuration options are written to an installation config file, that is then used for the actual installation.
While bsdinstall already supports scripted installations, its config file format is very free-form.
A more rigid config file design would make it easier to write other installation front-ends in the future.

The installer is currently a rough proof-of-concept, but it can handle a basic installation with limited configuration.
Help with testing would be appreciated; you can try the installer by downloading one of the releases in the ISO repository.
Also, please email me with any thoughts on the design of the installer, or on useful features it should have.

The Weblate project link:https://translate-dev.freebsd.org/projects/documentation/[Documentation (Books and Articles)] is open to the public.

The Automatic Translation feature was executed in all languages, re-using translations from the former project (Docbook).

There are still pending issues about the new translation process, and the status can be seen on link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Doc/IdeaList#Translation[IdeaList#Translation].

Website translations weren't released through Weblate yet. So we decided to hold it until we have more details about the working group that will redesign the Website and the Documentation Portal, to avoid re-work.

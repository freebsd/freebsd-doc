The purpose of this project is to provide an utility and a library to build scripts and tools with UI Widgets in a terminal.
The project is inspired by Dialog; however BSDDialog is released under the terms of the BSD-2-Clause License while Dialog is licensed as LGPL so a link of the project has been added to the "GPL Software in the Base System" wiki page.

The aim is to provide full compatibility with the dialog utility (the challenge is to implement over seventy options and almost thirty widgets).
The API compatibility with the library is not a priority because libbsddialog should meet FreeBSD's needs, for example it provides the new mixedlist() function, it can take as argument a set of: checklists, radiolists and separators, so it could be useful for building a dialog4ports clone: easier to implement and not depending on non-permissive dependencies.

BSDDialog is currently under development, no widget is really completed (autosizing, resizing and scrolling are missing), nevertheless runnable examples for the utility and the library are inside the example folders and described in the README.

Finally, a curiosity: BSDDialog started from the MixerTUI code base, however the original code has been almost completely rewritten.

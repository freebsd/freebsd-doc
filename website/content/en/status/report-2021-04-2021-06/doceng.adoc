Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project, more infomation on link:https://www.freebsd.org/internal/doceng/[FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter].

During the last quarter, we welcomed back Ceri Davies (ceri@) as a doc committer. Sergio Carlavilla (carlavilla@) and Danilo G. Baio (dbaio@) joined the doceng@ team.

A new article was included in the FreeBSD Documentation by Ka Ho Ng (khng@), link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/freebsd-src-lsp/[Use Language Servers for Development in the FreeBSD Src Tree].

Much work was done regarding the transition to Hugo/Asciidoctor, but there are still pending issues in the FreeBSD Documentation Project after the migration.
We thank everyone who is helping to find and fixing them.
The link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Doc/IdeaList[TODO items] wiki list was refreshed, and everyone is welcome to contribute to it.

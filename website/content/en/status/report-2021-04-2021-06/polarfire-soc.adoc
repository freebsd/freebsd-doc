The Conclusive Engineering team is working on support for the Microchip PolarFire FPGA SoC chip family.
PolarFire SoC is based on five 64-bit hard RISC-V cores, out of which four are equipped with MMU and capable of running FreeBSD.
The SoC also features an FPGA and various peripherals including Gigabit Ethernet, PCIe and multi-function 12.3Gbps SERDES transceivers.

At the time of writing, the following tasks have been completed:

* Initial platform bring-up with SMP support
* Add support for creating "booti"-style images for RISC-V
* Ethernet support

Work in progress:

* Clock and reset domain support
* USB driver
* PCI Express driver
* I2C driver
* SPI driver
* GPIO driver
* eNVM driver

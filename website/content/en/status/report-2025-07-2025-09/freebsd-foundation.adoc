The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to advancing FreeBSD through both technical and non-technical support.
Funded entirely by donations, the Foundation supports software development, infrastructure, security, and collaboration efforts; organizes events and developer summits; provides educational resources; and represents the FreeBSD Project in legal matters.

==== OS Improvements

Throughout the quarter, there were 451 `src`, 71 `ports`, and 25 `doc` commits sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Refer to the following report entries describing much of that committed development work:

* <<_process_credentials_groups_related_changes_in_freebsd_15,Process Credentials' Groups-Related Changes in FreeBSD 15>>

Other highlights include:

* Improved virtual memory scalability, allowing multiple processes to load shared libraries in parallel.
* Greater UFS reliability on very large filesystems (with more than 2 billion inodes).
* Support for systems with over 4 TB of RAM, including a reworked Kernel Virtual Address (KVA) layout tailored for the 57-bit address space (LA57) architecture.
* Kqueue inheritance across `fork()`.
* A new safeguard (`noshutdown`) to help prevent accidental system shutdown.
* Simplified and more reliable filesystem rename operations.
* A fix for amd64 pmap panics under low-memory conditions.
* Numerous fixes for race conditions in timeout handling.
* A new EXTERROR(9) interface, standardizing how external applications can report detailed error information.

The Foundation also continued to support two major initiatives: the Laptop Support and Usability project (in collaboration with link:https://www.ql-research.com/[Quantum Leap Research]) and an <<_infrastructure_modernization,infrastructure modernization project>> commissioned by the link:https://www.sovereign.tech/[Sovereign Tech Agency].
For background on both efforts, see the link:https://www.freebsd.org/status/report-2025-01-2025-03/#_freebsd_foundation[2025Q1 quarterly status report].

FreeBSD, under the management of the Foundation, participated in its 21st consecutive link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)] program.
All link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2025Projects[twelve projects] were successfully completed.

Four of those GSoC participants contributed report entries:

* <<_acpi_lua_bindings,ACPI Lua Bindings>>
* <<_sockstat_ui_improvements,Sockstat UI Improvements>>
* <<_geomman_release,Geomman Release>>
* <<_mac_do4_and_mdo1_improvements,mac_do(4) and mdo(1) Improvements>>

==== Advocacy

Advocacy work in the 3rd quarter of 2025 included representing FreeBSD at open source events, producing more technical tutorials and working on the upcoming November 2025 FreeBSD Vendor Summit.
Take a look at just a few of the ways the Foundation helped advocate for FreeBSD in Q3 of 2025:

==== Continuous Integration and Workflow Improvement

The Foundation supports a full-time staff member dedicated to improving the Project's continuous integration system and test infrastructure.

==== Legal/FreeBSD IP

The Foundation owns the FreeBSD trademarks, and it is our responsibility to protect them.
We also provide legal support for the core team to investigate questions that arise.

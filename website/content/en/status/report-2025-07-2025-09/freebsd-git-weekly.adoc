FreeBSD Git Weekly is a project that builds weekly lists of commits to the link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/[FreeBSD source tree], split into categories such as "documentation", "hardware support", "testing", and "kernel".

Our goal is to make it easier for developers and users to keep track of changes in FreeBSD that are relevant to them, without needing to subscribe to the mailto:https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/dev-commits-src-main[dev-commits-src-main] mailing list and look at every single commit which lands in their mailbox.

In the future, these reports might include summaries or additional information, but for now our focus is figuring out what type of classification will be most useful to the FreeBSD community.

These weekly reports began on 2025-09-01.

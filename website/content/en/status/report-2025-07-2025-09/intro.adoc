Here is the third 2025 status report, with 36 entries.

As usual, reports publication is slow due to some important reports arriving late.
We are sorry about that, but most of us are volunteers and we do our best.

Luckily, it seems that the number of volunteers is about to increase: last quarter I have seen much interest among new community members in getting involved in the FreeBSD Project.
This will surely improve the efficiency of the whole development, including status reporting.

Many new recruits approach us with the same question: "How do I start?".
This is not the place to give an answer to this question, but actually a guide has been written precisely to reply to it.
You can find it link://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/contributing/[here].
Moreover, it is always good to remember that using FreeBSD, as much as possible, helps a lot: use it as your daily driver, run your webservers on it, install it on your virtual machines, support it when you contribute to existing software!
And if you find bugs, do not forget to link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/[report] them.

Have a nice read!

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

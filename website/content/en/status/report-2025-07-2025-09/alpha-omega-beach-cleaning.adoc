Alpha-Omega's mission is to catalyze sustainable security improvements to critical open source projects and ecosystems.
After a successful project with the FreeBSD Foundation in 2024 -- auditing the bhyve hypervisor and the Capsicum sandboxing framework -- Alpha-Omega has selected FreeBSD again, for the Alpha Omega Beach Cleaning project this time.
This new grant consists in generally improving the security and maintenance of third-party software within the FreeBSD base system.
The FreeBSD Foundation received the grant and is managing and executing the project.

The list of tasks has been determined as follows:

* Inventory of dependencies
* Security risk assessments
* Propose list of priorities
* Plan the respective actions
* Formalize code owners
* Integrate review methodologies
* Plan execution & coordination
* Final report

The first deliverables have been issued on the dedicated GitHub repository:

* Machine-readable link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning/blob/main/database.yml[database]
* link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning/blob/main/dependencies.md[List of dependencies]
* link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning/blob/main/security.md[Security risk assessments]

Help is welcome to complete the information collected, and to improve on any other aspect of the project!

Finally, monthly reporting is submitted and available link:https://github.com/ossf/alpha-omega/tree/main/alpha/engagements/2025/FreeBSD[on GitHub].

==== Completed work

* Support for man:pf[4]-based NAT https://libvirt.org/drvnetwork.html#freebsd[networking] was merged and has been available since libvirt 11.7.0 release.
* Domain usage statistics reporting is also available starting with libvirt 11.7.0 release.
* TCP console support has been available since libvirt 11.6.0 release.
* The libvirt testing project, libvirt-tck, can now successfully run domain, network, and storage tests against the bhyve driver.

==== Plans for the next quarter

* Extend libvirt-tck testing with https://libvirt.org/hooks.html[hooks] tests.
* Add support for:
** Boot order configuration.
** TPM devices.
** Snapshot/resume to the bhyve driver (targeted, but might roll over to next quarter).
* Improve virt-manager support on FreeBSD.

Framework Computer Inc. is very supportive of the FreeBSD project in many ways, including providing engineering samples to the Foundation for testing and working on compatibility.

The Foundation continues to work on improving overall laptop support, and Framework laptops are one of the link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/blob/main/supported/laptops.md[target platforms] for the link:https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/[Laptop Support and Usability Project].

In the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2025, there are two hackathons held in Framework's Taipei office to test FreeBSD on the products newly releaased and in development.

In April, we continued testing Framework Laptop 12 and Framework Desktop for the support of the in-development 15.0, including the ethernet support, serial console access, etc.

In September, we worked on testing Framework Laptop 16 AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series, including the NVIDIA Graphics Module.

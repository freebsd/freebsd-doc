Sylve is a modern, unified system management platform for FreeBSD, inspired by Proxmox.
We aim to provide an integrated web interface for managing virtual machines (via Bhyve), Jails, ZFS storage, networking, and firewalling. The backend is implemented in Go, while the frontend uses SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components.

The project emphasizes a minimal system footprint, currently requiring only package:sysutils/smartmontools[], package:sysutils/tmux[], package:libvirt[], package:samba419[], package:swtpm[] as runtime dependencies.

==== Q3 Progress Highlights

===== Clustering

Sylve now supports simple clustering with a single-pane-of-glass (SPOG) experience.
This multi-master design, built on top of `hashicorp/raft` and SQLite, allows users to manage multiple nodes from a single interface.

===== Networking

* Network Objects: Subnets, hosts, and MACs are now treated as first-class objects. Users can create and reuse them across VMs, Jails, and switches.
* Manual Switches: Existing FreeBSD bridges can now be imported into Sylve and managed as switches.

===== Storage

* A new file explorer has been introduced for managing each node's local filesystem (copy, cut, delete, etc.).
* ZFS pools now feature extensive health monitoring, including support for special vdevs (cache, log, etc.).
* Major performance improvements to ZFS dataset viewing and editing.
* Ability to flash images to ZFS zvols directly from the UI.
* Samba integration: Users can now create Samba shares. A comprehensive audit log has been added to track file share activity.

===== Authentication

* Ability to create and manage users directly in the UI, including Samba users.
* Groups can now also be created and managed from the UI.

===== Virtual Machines

* Full VM editing is now supported (storage, network, PCI devices, etc.).
* TPM support (via package:swtpm[]) is available in both UI and API, this feature is currently experimental.
* Support for reusing existing raw disks.
* Added Wake-on-LAN functionality for VMs.

===== Jails

* Full support for thick jails (creation, editing, viewing).
* Resource limiting for CPU and RAM has been implemented.
* Networking for Jails supports both inherited configurations and switch-based (manual/standard) setups.

==== Roadmap Update

Due to community demand, Q3 focused on clustering instead of firewalling and network services.
The following items have been pushed to Q4:

* Firewall rules configuration.
* DHCP support.
* WireGuard VPN integration.

The current roadmap is to complete clustering with external storage backup support (e.g., S3) before returning to networking services.

Contributions, testing, and feedback are very welcome.
If you are interested in contributing, consider helping with:

* UI testing and accessibility feedback.
* Bug reports and feature requests via GitHub.

The goal of this project is to improve OpenJDK support for FreeBSD/amd64 and FreeBSD/arm64.

Java is an important runtime environment for many high performance, critical enterprise systems.
Making sure Java based applications run correctly and efficiently on FreeBSD is important to ensure that FreeBSD will continue to be a viable and attractive platform for enterprises, as well as businesses and organizations of all sizes.

In this quarter the following issues/milestones were reached:

* The OpenJDK 24 port https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=7aed795e864ced2f6dfee773d2371d01b23d5d4f[was updated to OpenJDK 24.0.2], and https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=8e3dc60231183008cea882574020f74163db9b58[once more] to include several fixes for the serviceability agent and performance improvements for large Elastic- and OpenSearch workloads.
  The serviceability improvements fixes symbol and thread lookups when attaching to another JVM, and fixes loading core files in the Java debugger on FreeBSD.
* The OpenJDK 23 port https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=a936fb9b16bac7cc5945213c7edf8c6a57709591[was updated] to include IPv6 dual protocol socket support (like OpenJDK 24), as well as the performance improvements for Elastic- and OpenSearch.
* OpenJDK https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=aaf3de01b3a035acaf6bf238772c149000158d21[8], https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=d1896072c1d6089df2fa62cc56d41e3970534d7f[17] and https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=b962e334545b2b095cca680a0958370af4e91144[21] were updated to the latest releases from upstream, and https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=e626e069e7d41ae373471a9b9596f34f54729acc[a new port] for installing just the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) of OpenJDK 21 was added.
* Build issues causing the official pkg builds of some older java versions on certain FreeBSD revisions to fail, was debugged and fixed by Ronald Klop.

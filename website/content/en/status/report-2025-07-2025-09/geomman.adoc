Geomman is a partitioning tool (TUI) based on man:sade[8] that brings more functionality such as copying, pasting partitions, creating ext filesystems or encrypting partitions using man:geli(8).

Geomman is relevant for both newcomers and experienced users bcause it is a complete and unified management of partitions and disks.

Features added to geomman since last report are:

* Grow UFS, NTFS, ext2, ext3 and ext 4 filesystems.
* Shrink NTFS, ext2, ext3 and ext 4 filesystem.
* New partition dialog, where users can visually select a free space to place the partition to be pasted or moved, added to link:https://gitlab.com/alfix/bsddialog[bsddialog].
* Create exFAT, NTFS, ext2, ext3 and ext 4 filesystems.
* Check all the mentioned filesystems.

Then, two GEOM-related features were added too:

* Label man:glabel(8) new partitions.
* Encrypt man:geli(8) new partitions by adding an optional "keyfile", plus a "passphrase" (or passfile).

Finally, with the help of Robert Clausecker, we published the link:https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/geomman[geomman port] to let people try it out. 

Future work includes:

* Add geomman to freebsd natively (userland)
* Add ZFS management

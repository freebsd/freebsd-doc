wtap(4) is a net80211(4) Wi-Fi simulator introduced by Monthadar Al Jaberi <monthadar@gmail.com> and Adrian Chadd <adrian@FreeBSD.org> in 2012.
It originally supported 802.11s mesh mode and was used for verification.
During the 2022 Google Summer of Code, En-Wei had been working on bringing sta, hostap, adhoc and monitor modes to it.
The work also covers adding basic tests for net80211(4) with wtap(4), written in atf(7).

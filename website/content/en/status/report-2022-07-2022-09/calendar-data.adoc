The port deskutils/calendar-data contains calendar files for the BSD calendar program and is maintained by se@.
The data for this port lives in a link:https://github.com/freebsd/calendar-data[GitHub repository], which at the moment is maintained mainly by salvadore@.

About two years ago, the calendar files in the base repository were removed from there and a new repository was created on GitHub; see also this link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D26883[Phabricator review about the creation of the associated port].
This improvement allows calendar files to be updated independently from the base system.

Unfortunately, when the repository was created, it was forgotten to add a license to it.
The issue has been solved this quarter with this link:https://github.com/freebsd/calendar-data/pull/9[pull request] submitted by salvadore@ and merged by imp@.
Since the data originally came from the src repository, the same licence applies.
If in the past you have contributed to the calendar files with different licensing assumptions, please inform us so that we can license your contributions accordingly or remove them.

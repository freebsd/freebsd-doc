Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work and communications.
In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

* Added additional storage to the CI system.
It will help store more artifacts.
* link:https://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/index.html[VuXML] deployed in all official mirrors.
It speeds up the `pkg audit` functionality.
* A new (and additional) monitoring system is in place.
* A few old and faulty machines were decommissioned.
* Moved several services to newer hardware.
* Regular cluster-wide software upgrades
* Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts
* Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical hosts and mirrors.

Work in progress:

* git infra: Add `--filter` support.
* Work with the PowerPC team to improve the package builders, universal, and reference machines.
* Site audit at our primary site: inventory of spares and other miscellanea occupying space in our cabinets.
* Discussions with link:https://www.juniper.net/[Juniper] about a donation of new switches for our primary site.
* Plan for a large scale network upgrade at our primary site.
* Cluster refresh (more extended project).
Most cluster machines are running FreeBSD `13-STABLE` or `14-CURRENT` as of 2022-09-30.
Only a handful of machines are still on FreeBSD `12-STABLE`.

We are looking for an additional full mirror site (five servers) in Europe.
See link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/generic-mirror-layout[generic mirrored layout] for our needs.
Offers of link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/tiny-mirror[additional single-server mirrors] are always welcome too, especially in Europe.

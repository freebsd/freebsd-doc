package:sysutils/lsof[] had a major upgrade to no longer look in `/dev/kmem` for data, and to use the userland API.
This took a long time to hit the tree, but is finally done.
It fixes man:lsof[8] to work with ZFS again for the first time since 13.0-RELEASE.

This will make maintenance much easier going forward.

To the kernel folks: if you make changes that break lsof, please submit a GitHub pull request to https://github.com/lsof-org/lsof.
Please test any changes to the interfaces that lsof uses and make sure they still work.
These all should be userland interfaces now, but please test.

My thanks to Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>, Mateusz Guzik <mjg@FreeBSD.org>, and Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org> for help getting this major change landed.

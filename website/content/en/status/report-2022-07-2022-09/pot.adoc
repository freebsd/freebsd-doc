Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During the last quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/releases/tag/0.15.3[pot 0.15.3] was released.
It contains a number of improvements like mount-out to remove or unmount a previously mount-in folder or filesystem, signal and exec commands, better jail lifecycle handling, and many bug fixes.

A new version of the Nomad driver, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/nomad-pot-driver/releases/tag/v0.9.0[nomad-pot-driver 0.9.0], was also released with signal and exec support and stability fixes.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

Since the last status report, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/commits/master[many changes were committed], including many fixes and improvements to core images like link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/grafana[grafana], link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/postgresql-patroni[postgresql-patroni] or link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/loki[loki].
Additionally, all images have been rebuilt for FreeBSD 13.1 and 12.3 and to include the current quarterly versions of the packages being used.

Last not least, Luca held the pot implementation and ecosystem talk link:https://2022.eurobsdcon.org/program/[How far a naive FreeBSD container implementation can go] at EuroBSDCon 2022.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work and communications.

In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

* Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts.
* Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical hosts and mirrors.
* Improve the PowerPC package builders.
** With new parts obtained through the FreeBSD Foundation, the builders now have new NVMEs with heatsinks and more memory.
It helped to solve the heat issue, and they are building packages faster now.
* Decouple dynamic resources from the main websites.
** Work in coordination with doceng and webmaster to decouple dynamic resources from the websites, www.FreeBSD.org, and docs.FreeBSD.org.

==== Work in progress

* Large-scale network upgrade at our primary site.
** New link:https://www.juniper.net/[Juniper] switches arrived at our primary site to replace the former ones.
We thank Juniper for the donation.
* Replace old servers in our primary site and a few mirrors.
** Besides the broken CI servers, we have a few old servers with broken disks and faulty PSUs.
This task is in conjunction with the FreeBSD Foundation and donors/sponsors.
* Deploy infrastructure to mirror the websites.
** Since the FreeBSD website is now mostly static, we have begun deploying infrastructure to mirror www.FreeBSD.org and docs.FreeBSD.org around the world in FreeBSD project-managed mirrors.
* Create a new search database engine for internal FreeBSD.org searching needs like mailing list and docs.

==== FreeBSD Official Mirrors Overview

Current locations are Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan (two full mirror sites), Malaysia, South Africa, Taiwan, United Kingdom (full mirror site), United States of America -- California, New Jersey (primary site), and Washington.

The Frankfurt single server mirror is the primary Europe mirror in bandwidth and usage.

We are still looking for an additional full mirror site (five servers) in Europe to replace old servers in the United Kingdom full mirror site.

We see a good pattern in having single mirrors in Internet Exchange Points worldwide (Australia, Brazil, and South Africa); if you know or work for some of them that could sponsor a single mirror server, please get in touch.
United States (West Coast) and Europe (anywhere) are preferable places.

See link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/generic-mirror-layout[generic mirrored layout] for full mirror site specs and link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/tiny-mirror[tiny-mirror] for a single mirror site.

=== Enabling Snapshots on Filesystems Using Journaled Soft Updates in 13.2

Contact: Marshall Kirk McKusick <mckusick@freebsd.org>

The ability to make UFS/FFS filesystem snapshots when running with journaled soft updates, and using them for doing background dumps on a live filesystem, was merged to `releng/13.2` during the first quarter of 2023, and lands in FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE.

Background dumps are requested by using the `-L` flag to man:dump[8].

Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During the last quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/commits/master[pot] received a number of minor fixes but no new version has been released yet.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

All Potluck images have been rebuilt to include the latest FreeBSD security advisories, a new link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/smokeping[Smokeping network latency monitoring image has been added], again a lot of work went into the link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/jitsi-meet[Jitsi] image, which unfortunately still seems to have some reliability issues.

Also, two new blog posts are available showing how easy it is to use Potluck images, link:https://honeyguide.eu/posts/minio-beast-nextcloud/[one explaining how to set up Nextcloud with Minio as object storage and Prometheus for monitoring], link:https://honeyguide.eu/posts/openldap-matrix-blog-post/[one showing how to run your own Matrix Synapse server using OpenLDAP for access management].

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

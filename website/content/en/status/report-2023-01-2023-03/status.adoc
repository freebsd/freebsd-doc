==== The new workflow has started

In the first quarter of this year, the link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/project/profile/88/[status team] has started implementing the new workflow that was announced at the end of 2022.
Here are some details.

==== New email addresses

Last quarter we have announced the creation of new email addresses:

- <status@FreeBSD.org>, for interacting with the _status_ team directly;
- <status-submissions@FreeBSD.org, for sending reports submissions;
- <freebsd-status-calls@FreeBSD.org>, a mailing list to which you can link:https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-status-calls[subscribe] to get reminders about status report submission deadlines.

Unfortunately, the mailing list does not work as expected at the moment.
link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=269893[The issue has been reported] but no solution could be found yet.
However, a work around allowed to send the second and the last reminder to the link:https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-status-calls/2023-March/[list].

==== Automation

Some automation has been introduced to ensure that no report submission is lost:

- on Phabricator a link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/H166[herald rule] automatically blocks any review touching the status reports directory: even if a report submitter forgets to add the _status_ team as reviewer, salvadore@ (member of the _status_ team) will block the patch anyway.
The same rule will also block any review that includes the _status_ team as reviewer, to ensure that at least one member of _status_ has reviewed the patch before commit.
- a link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/label-pull-requests.yml[GitHub action] automatically adds the newly introduced link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/pulls?q=label%3A%22status+report%22[status report] label to any pull request touching the status reports directory.
The GitHub action should be easily modifiable by anyone wanting to apply more labels automatically depending on the path of the modified files.

More automation is planned.

==== Documentation reorganization

The status report link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/diff/website/content/en/status/README?id=7cd49b34af842b2cf247c944b7d8bc3c1bef8fc8[README] and link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/diff/website/content/en/status/howto/_index.adoc?id=7cd49b34af842b2cf247c944b7d8bc3c1bef8fc8[How To] have been updated and merged in one unique document: the link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/freebsd-status-report-process/[FreeBSD status report process].
You can check it out to read details about reports submission and publication.
It will be updated regularly as the status team proceeds with the implementation of its new workflow.
In particular, new material about automation is coming soon.

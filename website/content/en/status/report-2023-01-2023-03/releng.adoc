The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the first quarter of 2023, the Release Engineering Team started work on the upcoming 13.2-RELEASE.
As of this writing, the 13.2 cycle has followed the originally set schedule, with the addition of fourth, fifth and sixth RC builds, postponing the final release from the end of March to early April.

The Release Engineering Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the *main*, *stable/13*, and *stable/12* branches.

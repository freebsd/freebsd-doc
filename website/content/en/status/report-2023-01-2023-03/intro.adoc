Here is the first status report of 2023, including 25 reports: we have our usual team reports, some news about cloud projects, progress in the src, ports and doc trees and more.

We also provide some information about link:../../releases/13.2R/announce/[13.2-RELEASE], which was postponed to the beginning of 2023Q2; but since this report is being published after the new version release, it is already available for installation.
Users of RELEASE versions can now take advantage of many improvements such as better support for the man:iwlwifi[4] driver or the new man:rtw88[4] driver, topics that have been covered in past status reports.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the status team.

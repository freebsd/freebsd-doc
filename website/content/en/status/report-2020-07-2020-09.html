July and September, and is the third of four planned reports for 2020.
</p><p>This quarter brings a good mix of additions and changes to the FreeBSD
Project and community, from a diverse number of teams and people covering
everything from architectures, continuous integration, wireless networking
and drivers, over drm, desktop and third-party project work, as well as
several team reports, along with many other interesting subjects too
numerous to mention.
</p><p>As the world is still affected by the epidemic, we hope that this report
can also serve as a good reminder that there is good work that can be done
by people working together, even if we're apart.
</p><p>We hope you'll be as interested in reading it, as we've been in making it.<br clear="none" />

	Contact: Deb Goodkin &lt;<a href="mailto:deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org">deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to
supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.  Funding
comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to fund and manage
software development projects, conferences and developer summits, and provide
travel grants to FreeBSD contributors.  The Foundation purchases and supports
hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure and provides resources
to improve security, quality assurance, and release engineering efforts;
publishes marketing material to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD
Project; facilitates collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD
developers; and finally, represents the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts,
license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require a recognized
legal entity.
</p>
<p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD last quarter:
</p>
<h3>COVID-19 Impact to the Foundation</h3>

<p>Like other organizations, we put policies in place for all of our staff members
to work from home.  We also put a temporary ban on travel for staff members.
We are continuing our work supporting the community and Project, but some of
our work and responses may be delayed because of changes in some of our
priorities and the impact of limited childcare for a few of our staff members.
</p>
<h3>Partnerships and Commercial User Support</h3>

<p>We help facilitate collaboration between commercial users and FreeBSD
developers.  We also meet with companies to discuss their needs and bring that
information back to the Project.  Not surprisingly, the stay at home orders,
combined with our company ban on travel during Q3 made in-person meetings
non-existent.  However, the team was able to continue meeting with our partners
and commercial users virtually.  These meetings help us understand some of the
applications where FreeBSD is used.
</p>
<p>We are currently scheduling Zoom company meetings for Q4, please reach out if
you would like to schedule a meeting with us.
</p>
<h3>Fundraising Efforts</h3>

<p>Last quarter we raised $192,874.43!  Thank you to the individuals and
organizations that stepped in, to help fund our efforts.  We'd like to thank
Arm for their large contribution last quarter, which helped bring our 2020
fundraising effort to $521k.  We hope other organizations will follow their
lead and give back to help us continue supporting FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>These are trying times, and we deeply appreciate every donation that has come
in from $5 to $150,000. We're still here giving 110% to supporting FreeBSD!
</p>
<p>We are 100% funded by donations, and those funds go towards software
development work to improve FreeBSD, FreeBSD advocacy around the world, keeping
FreeBSD secure, continuous integration improvements, sponsoring BSD-related and
computing conferences (even the virtual events!), legal support for the
Project, and many other areas.
</p>
<p>Please consider making a
<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/." shape="rect">donation to help us continue and increase our support for FreeBSD</a>.
</p>
<p>We also have the Partnership Program, to provide more benefits for our larger
commercial donors.  Find out more information about the
<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/" shape="rect">partnership program</a>
and share with your companies!
</p>
<h3>OS Improvements</h3>

<p>A number of FreeBSD Foundation grant recipients started, continued working on,
or completed projects during the third quarter.  These include:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Ongoing WiFi and Linux KPI layer improvements.
</p></li>
<li><p>Linuxulator application compatibility.
</p></li>
<li><p>DRM / Graphics driver updates.
</p></li>
<li><p>Zstd compression for OpenZFS.
</p></li>
<li><p>Online RAID-Z expansion.
</p></li>
<li><p>Modernized LLDB target support for FreeBSD.
</p>
</li></ul>
You can find more details about most of these projects in other quarterly
<p>reports.
</p>
<p>Staff members also worked on a number of larger projects, including:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Run-Time Dynamic Linker (rtld) and kernel ELF loader improvements.
</p></li>
<li><p>Rewritten UNIX domain socket locking.
</p></li>
<li><p>Build infrastructure.
</p></li>
<li><p>Open system call path handling support for O_BENEATH, O_RESOLVE_BENEATH.
</p></li>
<li><p>arm64 support.
</p></li>
<li><p>Migration to a Git repository.
</p>
</li></ul>
Many of these projects also have detailed entries in other quarterly report
<p>entries.
</p>
<p>Staff members also put in significant effort in many ways other than larger,
individual projects.  These include assisting with code reviews, bug report
triage, security report triage and advisory handling, addressing syzkaller
reports, and ongoing maintenance and bug fixes in functional areas such as the
tool chain, developer tools, virtual memory kernel subsystem, low-level x86
infrastructure, sockets and protocols, and others.
</p>
<h3>University of Waterloo Co-op</h3>

<p>With the transition to working from home, the Foundation decided to again take
on three University of Waterloo Co-op students for the Fall 2020 term
(September to December).  Tiger returns for a second term, joined by new
students Yang and Zac.  Projects for the term include more work on
ELF Tool Chain, application of Capsicum to additional utilities, testing and
integration of FreePBX and Asterisk VOIP software, pkgbase, and exploring
containerization tooling.
</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member and funds projects on
improving continuous integration, automated testing, and overall quality
assurance efforts for the FreeBSD project.
</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2020, Foundation staff continued improving and
monitoring the Project's CI infrastructure, and working with experts to fix
the failing builds and the regressions found by tests.  The setting up of
dedicated VM host for running tests is completed.  New feature developments
and the CI staging environment is in progress.  We are also working with
other teams in the Project for their testing needs. For example, tests of
non-x86 architectures now run periodically, and improve the CI of the
embedded systems. We are also working with many external projects and
companies to improve the CI between their products and FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for completed work items and detailed
information.
</p>
<h3>Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve the FreeBSD
infrastructure.  Last quarter, we continued supporting FreeBSD hardware located
around the world.  We coordinated efforts between the new NYI Chicago facility
and clusteradm to start working on getting the facility prepared for some of
the new FreeBSD hardware we are planning on purchasing.  NYI generously
provides this for free to the Project.  We also worked on connecting with the
new owners of the Bridgewater site, where most of the FreeBSD infrastructure is
located.
</p>
<p>Some of the purchases we made for the Project last quarter to support
infrastructure includes:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Spamhaus spam filtering software to limit the amount of spam on the mailing
lists.
</p></li>
<li><p>5 application servers to run tasks like bugzilla, wiki, website, cgi,
Phabricator, host git, etc.
</p></li>
<li><p>1 server to replace the old pkg server and provide a lot more IOPS to
   avoid the slowdowns seen during peak times of the day where the disks just
cannot keep up with the request volume.
</p></li>
<li><p>1 server for exp-runs to make them faster.
</p></li>
<li><p>1 server to build packages more frequently.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>FreeBSD Advocacy and Education</h3>

<p>A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for the Project.  This
includes promoting work being done by others with FreeBSD; producing advocacy
literature to teach people about FreeBSD and help make the path to starting
using FreeBSD or contributing to the Project easier; and attending and getting
other FreeBSD contributors to volunteer to run FreeBSD events, staff FreeBSD
tables, and give FreeBSD presentations.
</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and summits around
the globe.  These events can be BSD-related, open source, or technology events
geared towards underrepresented groups.  We support the FreeBSD-focused events
to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to work together on projects,
and to facilitate collaboration between developers and commercial users.  This
all helps provide a healthy ecosystem.  We support the non-FreeBSD events to
promote and raise awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in
different applications, and to recruit more contributors to the Project.  As is
the case for most of us in this industry, COVID-19 has put our in-person events
on hold.  In addition to attending virtual events, we are continually working
on new training initiatives and updating our selection of how-to guides to
facilitate getting more folks to try out FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>Check out some of the advocacy and education work we did last quarter:
</p><ul>

	Contact: FreeBSD Release Engineering Team &lt;<a href="mailto:re@FreeBSD.org">re@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective
branches, among other things.
</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2020, the Release Engineering Team started
work on the 12.2-RELEASE cycle, the third release from the stable/12
branch.
</p>
<p>As of this writing, two BETA builds have been released, with the
expectation there will be a third BETA build currently remaining on the
schedule.
</p>
<p>The 12.2-RELEASE cycle will continue throughout October, with two RC
builds currently planned, and RC3 scheduled on an as-needed basis.  The
12.2-RELEASE is so far scheduled for final release on October 27.
</p>
<p>In addition to the 12.2-RELEASE, Glen Barber of the Release Engineering
Team finished work to the release build tools and scripts to prepare for
the conversion from Subversion to Git for the 13.0-RELEASE cycle.  There
are no plans to merge these changes to stable branches at this time; as
discussed within the Git working group, we feel such a change on a stable
branch would be too intrusive to our user base as well as downstream
FreeBSD consumers.  Development snapshot builds for 13.0-CURRENT have
recently been built from the Git tree within the project, and further
snapshot builds for 12.x and 11.x will continue to be built from Subversion.
</p>
<p>Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the <i>head</i>, <i>stable/12</i>, and <i>stable/11</i> branches.
</p>
<p>Finally, the Release Engineering Team would like to thank Marius Strobl
for his time serving on the team; he had recently stepped down from the
Deputy RE Lead role due to constraints on his time.  The Team welcomes
Colin Percival, who has accepted fulfilling this role.
</p>
<p>Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (netgate.com)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.

<p>The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system
of the FreeBSD project.  The CI system firstly checks the committed changes
can be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results.
The artifacts from those builds are archived in the artifact server for
further testing and debugging needs.  The CI team members examine the
failing builds and unstable tests and work with the experts in that area to
fix the codes or adjust test infrastructure.  The details of these efforts
are available in the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@FreeBSD-CI" shape="rect">weekly CI reports</a>.
</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2020, we continued working with the contributors and
developers in the project to fulfill their testing needs and also keep
collaborating with external projects and companies to improve their products
and FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>Important changes:
</p><ul>
<li><p>All !x86 -test builds now trigger a new build on 22:00 UTC daily; this was

	</p><p>The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the
overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and
personnel matters.  Below is what happened in the last quarter.
</p>
<p>We passed the landmark of 40,000 ports in the Ports Collection
and are now around 40,400 ports.  The last quarter saw 9335
commits to the HEAD branch and 481 commits to the 2020Q3 branch
by respectively 167 and 63 committers.  There are currently 2525
open problem reports of which 595 are unassigned.  Compared to
last quarter, this means a slight decrease in activity and also
a slight increase in open PRs.
</p>
<p>During the last quarter we welcomed Rainer Hurling (rhurlin@) and
said goodbye to Kevin Lo (kevlo@) and Grzegorz Blach (gblach@).
</p>
<p>The last three months saw new default versions for Perl (5.32),
PostgreSQL (12) and PHP (7.4). Various packages also got updated:
Firefox to 81.0.1, Chromium to 84.0.4147.135, Gnome to 3.36,
Xorg to 1.20.9, Qt5 to 5.15.0, Emacs to 27.1, KDE Frameworks to
5.74.0 and pkg itself to 1.15.8.
</p>
<p>Never tired, antoine@ ran 30 exp-runs to test port version updates,
on such diverse matters as:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Updating byacc in base to 20200330.
</p></li>
<li><p>Check balancing of sed "y" command.
</p></li>
<li><p>Use of brackets.

	</p><p>The FreeBSD X11/Graphics team maintains the lower levels of the FreeBSD graphics
stack.
This includes graphics drivers, graphics libraries such as the
MESA OpenGL implementation, the X.org xserver with related libraries and
applications, and Wayland with related libraries and applications.
</p>
<p>There have been several updates to the FreeBSD graphics stack and related
libraries since the last report.
</p>
<p>Most notably, MESA related ports were changed to use the meson build system,
instead of the autotools based one.
This was needed since mesa upstream has deprecated and removed the autotools
build system, and this paved the way for further mesa updates.
While there was a need for a few minor corrections after the initial update,
this update has been successful and made it possible to further update and
improve the FreeBSD mesa port.
</p>
<p>There have also been several security fixes for <code>xorg-server</code> and <code>libX11</code>, so
these ports have been updated to fix these issues.
</p>
<p>During the period, FreeBSD 12 was changed to improve the compatibility with
input devices using udev/evdev and libinput.
This change removes the need for local configuration and makes most mice,
touchpads and keyboards work out of the box.
This change will be in the upcoming FreeBSD 12.2 release.
</p>
<p>There have also been several updates to various libraries, both in the graphics
and input stacks, and several userland drivers have been updated.
Libraries such as <code>libdrm</code> and <code>libevdev</code> have been updated to include new
FreeBSD support, developed by team members and added upstream.
</p>
<p>There has also been ongoing work to keep the various drm-kmod ports and packages
up to date, mostly in response to changes in various FreeBSD versions.
</p>
<p>We have also continued our regularly scheduled bi-weekly meetings.

	</p><p>Until recently FreeBSD could only be built on a FreeBSD host.
However, many popular free CI tools only allow building on Linux or macOS and
therefore can not be used for building the FreeBSD base system. Furthermore, it
is sometimes useful to cross-build FreeBSD for a remote machine or an emulator
even if the build machine is not running FreeBSD.
The goal of this project is to allow building the base system on Linux and macOS
hosts.
</p>
<p>I started this project in 2017 to allow building <a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd" shape="rect">CheriBSD</a> on the Linux servers
and desktops that many of us working on the <a href="http://www.cheri-cpu.org" shape="rect">CHERI project</a> use.
The first few patches were upstreamed in 2018 (see the 2018q3 report) and
I merged the full set of patches to CheriBSD shortly after. Over the past two
years I have slowly been upstreaming the remaining patches and finally committed
the last required change in time for this report.
</p>
<p>As of September 2020 it should be possible to use the <code>buildworld</code> and
<code>buildkernel</code> make targets to build a fully-functional FreeBSD installation
on macOS and Linux hosts. We use this in our continuous integration system to
build and test CheriBSD disk images for multiple architectures.
I have also committed a <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" shape="rect">GitHub Actions</a> configuration upstream
that takes approximately 10 minutes to build an amd64 kernel.
This will ensure that changes that break crossbuilding from Linux/macOS
can be detected easily.
</p>
<p>Upstreaming the crossbuilding changes has resulted in various build system
cleanups. For example, we now <a href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS365836" shape="rect">no longer need to use lorder.sh</a>
when building libraries which speeds up the linking step a bit.
The portability and bootstrapping changes should also make it easier
to upgrade from older versions since we no longer rely on host headers in
<code>/usr/include</code> matching those of the target system (e.g. when bootstrapping
localedef, etc.).
</p>
<p>While this support for building on Linux and macOS should still be considered
experimental, it should work in many cases. If you would like to give it a try,
the following command line should successfully build an amd64 world on Linux
and macOS systems that have packages for LLVM 10 (or newer) installed:
<code>MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/somewhere ./tools/build/make.py TARGET=amd64 TARGET_ARCH=amd64 buildworld</code>
Builds must be performed using the <code>./tools/build/make.py</code> wrapper script since
most Linux and macOS systems do not ship an appropriate version of bmake.
Please let me know if you encounter any issues.

	</p><p>Work continues on FreeBSD's migration from Subversion to Git.  Ulrich has
addressed all known issues with svn2git and has been able to work around the
inconsistent metadata and forced commit issues in the Subversion history.
</p>
<p>We still have additional documentation to write, and need to finish installing
commit hooks (e.g. restricting branch creation, or ensuring appropriate data
exists on cherry-pick commits).
</p>
<p>We expect to open the beta repository to test commits before the end of
October.  This is to allow testing of the commit hooks, and to allow developers
to test access and become familiar with git operation.  Commits in this
repository will be deleted and the repository will be recreated at least once
prior to the final migration.
</p>
<p>Those with an interest in the migration to Git are encouraged to subscribe
to the
<a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-git" shape="rect">FreeBSD-git mailing list</a>
and test out the beta src, ports, and/or doc repositories.
</p>
<p>You are also welcome check out the wiki, issues, README and other documentation
at the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/git_conv" shape="rect">Git conversion tooling repo</a>.
</p>
<p>We currently expect to transition the src and doc repositories in mid-November.
Additional investigation and experimentation with the ports repository is still
underway.

	</p><p>Earlier Linuxulator work focused on code cleanups and improving
diagnostic tools.
Work has now shifted from cleanups to fixing actual applications.
Current status is being tracked at <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LinuxApps" shape="rect">Linux app status Wiki page</a>.
Initial focus was on applications that don't involve X11, mostly
because they tend to be easier to test and debug, and the bug fixes
are not application-specific.
</p>
<p>Foundation-sponsored work during this quarter included implementing
a devfs(5) workaround to fix gettynam(3) inside jail/chroot, and
workaround for the missing splice(2) syscall, which caused problems
for grep and autotools. The Linux version reported to userspace was bumped
to 3.10.0, which matches the kernel shipped with RHEL 7 and is neccessary
for IBM's DB2 database installation to succeed.  The BLKPBSZGET ioctl neccessary for
Oracle database is supported now.  There is now support for kcov(4),
neccessary for syzcaller; as well as a number of fixes for issues
reported by syzcaller, such as futex lock leaks.
There were also more cleanups, including moving
some Linuxulator-specific functionality related to error handling off
from the syscall's fast code paths.  The sysutils/debootstrap port,
which provides an easy way to create Debian or Ubuntu jail, was updated
to version 1.0.123.  Finally there were some improvements
to the <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LinuxJails" shape="rect">documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>Most of those changes have been merged to FreeBSD 12-STABLE, in order
to ship with 12.2-RELEASE.
</p>
<p>There is increased involvement from other developers; this includes termios
performance fixes, improved memfd support, implementing <code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW</code>
required for Steam, madvise improvements, new <code>compat.linux.use_emul_path</code>
sysctl.  There is also ongoing work
on tracking down the causes of failures related to Steam and WebKit, with
fixes being first implemented in <a href="https://github.com/shkhln/linuxulator-steam-utils/wiki/Compatibility" shape="rect">linuxulator-steam-utils</a>.

	</p><p>FreeBSD includes LLDB, the debugger in the LLVM family, in the base
system. At present it has some limitations in comparison with the GNU
GDB debugger, and does not yet provide a complete replacement. It
relies on an obsolete plugin model in LLDB that causes growing
technical debt. This project aims to bring LLDB closer to a fully
featured replacement for GDB, and therefore for FreeBSD to feature a
modern debugger for software developers.
</p>
<p>The legacy monolithic target supports the executed application being
debugged in the same process space as the debugger. The modern LLDB
plugin approach, used on other supported targets, executes the
target process under a separate lldb-server process. This improves
reliability and simplifies the process / thread model in LLDB itself.
In addition, remote and local debugging will both be performed using
the same approach.
</p>
<p>After the migration to the new process model is complete, the project
will include reviewing the results of LLDB's test suite and fixing
tests as time permits. The work is expected to be complete in 2020.
</p>
<p>The project schedule is divided into three milestones, each taking approximately
one month:
</p>
<p>  1. Introduce new FreeBSD Remote Process Plugin for x86_64 with basic support and upstream to LLVM.
  2. Ensure and add the mandated features in the project (process launch, process attach (pid), process attach (name), userland core files, breakpoints, watchpoints, threads, remote debugging) for FreeBSD/amd64 and FreeBSD/i386.
  3. Iterate over the LLDB tests. Detect, and as time permits, fix bugs. Ensure bug reports for each non-fixed and known problem. Add missing man pages and update the FreeBSD Handbook.
</p>
<p>We are nearing the completion of the first milestone. The new plugin is getting into
shape, and it can already run simple single-threaded programs. The supported features
include single-stepping, breakpoints, memory and register I/O on amd64.
Both plugins are supported simultaneously. The new plugin is used if
FREEBSD_REMOTE_PLUGIN environment variable is set to any value, or if lldb-server is
spawned directly. Otherwise, the old plugin is used for compatibility. Once the new
plugin matures, we are planning to enable it unconditionally on the architectures that
it is ported to.

	Contact: Rick Macklem &lt;<a href="mailto:rmacklem@freebsd.org">rmacklem@freebsd.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>In an effort to improve NFS security, an internet draft
which I expect will become an RFC soon specifies the
use of TLS 1.3 to encrypt all data traffic on a Sun RPC
connection used for NFS.
</p>
<p>Although NFS has been able to use sec=krb5p to encrypt data
on the wire, this requires a Kerberos environment and, as
such, has not been widely adopted. It also required that
encryption/decryption be done in software, since only the
RPC message NFS arguments are encrypted.
Since Kernel TLS is capable of using hardware assist to
improve performance and does not require Kerberos, NFS
over TLS may be more widely adopted, once implementations
are available.
</p>
<p>The coding for this project has now been completed.
All required changes to the NFS and kernel RPC code have
been committed to -CURRENT.
The daemons are now believed to be complete, but will
remain in base/projects/nfs-over-tls until -CURRENT
has an OpenSSL library with the kernel TLS support
incorporated in it.
If this does not happen for FreeBSD-13, hopefully the
patched OpenSSL and the daemons can become ports.
</p>
<p>To support clients such as laptops, the daemons that perform the TLS
handshake may optionally handle client X.509 certificates from a
site local CA. There are now exports(5) options to require client(s) to
provide a valid X.509 certificate.
</p>
<p>While setting up system(s) for testing is still a little awkward,
<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~rmacklem/nfs-over-tls-setup.txt" shape="rect">the documentation is now available for those who want to help with testing</a>.
</p>
<p>The main limitation in the current implementation is that it uses TLS1.2
and not TLS1.3. This should change once the KERN_TLS rx patch includes
TLS1.3 support.
</p>
<p>Third party testing would be appreciated.

	</p><p>See the syzkaller entry in the 2019q1 quarterly report for an
introduction to syzkaller.
</p>
<p>syzkaller, especially the public syzbot instance, continues to find bugs
in the FreeBSD kernel.  A number of these bugs have been fixed in
subsystems such as the VFS name cache, the TCP and SCTP stacks, pf(4),
the unix domain socket implementation, and the Linuxulator.
</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsored some work to enable cross-OS fuzzing.
This makes it possible to fuzz the Linuxulator using syzkaller's Linux
target.  This effort quickly found several bugs; once the support is
committed upstream we will hopefully be able to leverage syzbot to gain
continuous testing of the Linux system call interface in addition to the
native and 32-bit compatibility interfaces.
</p>
<p>Some work was also done to enable running syzkaller in a FreeBSD jail,
with the eventual aim of making it easy to distribute binary images
containing everything required to immediately start running syzkaller on
a new host.  Currently a number of setup steps are required, making
deployment somewhat painful.

	</p><p>The eBPF eXpress Data Path (XDP) allows eBPF programs to be run to filter
received packets as early as possible, avoiding unnecessary processing
overhead before the filter is run. The goal of this project is to extend an
existing FreeBSD network driver (a virtual NIC like a VirtIO if_vtnet) to
be able to call into an eBPF program when processing a newly received
packet. In short, with XDP the driver must PASS (accept and process normally), DROP,
TX or REDIRECT the packet as specified by the program. eBPF helper
functions and maps for aiding in packet filtering will also be
implemented.
</p>
<p>Implemented:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Register a eBPF probe when an interface is registered with pfil.
</p></li>
<li><p>Activating eBPF probe.
</p></li>
<li><p>Create hooks and link them to the pfil head when the eBPF XDP probe is
 activated and successfully list the XDP probes.
</p></li>
<li><p>Create a xdp_rx function which will pass the received packets to the
 eBPF program where the packets can be further processed. This function will
 return XDP actions: DROP and PASS.
</p></li>
<li><p>Register the xdp hook and link it to the pfil head.
</p></li>
<li><p>Write an eBPF program to process (currently drop and pass) ICMP traffic -
 This is to test that the hook is working properly.
</p></li>
<li><p>Write a loader function to load the ICMP filter program to the kernel.
</p>
</li></ul>
Future Work:
<ul>
<li><p>Currently we can only attach the XDP hook to PASS and DROP the packets -
 The work on detaching the hook is left.
</p></li>
<li><p>The XDP action to &#8220;TX&#8221; and &#8220;REDIRECT&#8221; the packets.
</p>
</li></ul>
Final Deliverables:
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented XDP hook to pass and drop packets.
</p></li>
<li><p>Created a loader program to attach the eBPF program to the kernel.
</p></li>
<li><p>A test program to DROP ICMP filter.
</p>
</li></ul>
This code was done under the Google Summer of Code 2020 under the guidance
<p>of Ryan Stone (rstone@). The eBPF implementation for FreeBSD
is still a work in progress and FreeBSD doesn&#8217;t support eBPF yet. The
basic implementation for eBPF was a <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2018Projects/eBPF" shape="rect">GSoC&#8217;18 project</a>,
and is still under development. This project is based on that implementation so the XDP
implementation for FreeBSD can only be merged into the FreeBSD source code
once it supports eBPF.
</p>
<p>Currently this code is a work in progress and is merged to Ryan Stone&#8217;s

	</p><p>As of r366063, experimental support for little-endian PowerPC64 (PowerPC64LE)
is available in -CURRENT for POWER8 and POWER9 machines.
</p>
<p>In 2010, when FreeBSD was ported to PowerPC64, the average
user would have been using a G5 PowerMac, a purely big-endian
machine.
</p>
<p>While, at the time, a 32-bit PowerPC machine could run in little-endian,
as well as POWER6 and POWER7, in practice, the complexities involved
in managing it at the kernel level and lack of firmware support made it
infeasible to support.
</p>
<p>When IBM designed POWER8, one main focus was to improve little-endian support,
and bring it up to parity with big-endian.
</p>
<p>This improved support makes it practical to support a little-endian operating
environment on what is traditionally a primarily big-endian platform.
</p>
<p>In 2020, with POWER9 being affordable for many users thanks to the Raptor
Blackbird, semi-easy access to surplus POWER8 hardware, IBM having
a major future focus on POWER little-endian, and the decay of big-endian
support in modern video cards and graphical environments, there is demand for
a little-endian version of FreeBSD on POWER.
</p>
<p>With FreeBSD/PowerPC64's transition in 2019 to the ELFv2 ABI as part of the
2019q4 PowerPC on Clang effort, the last major barrier to a little-endian
port was eliminated.
</p>
<p>Since nobody else was working on it, and I had the skillset required to do
the port, I decided to experiment one weekend with a little-endian kernel
to see how difficult it would be to port.
</p>
<p>It turned out to be a lot more trivial than I was expecting. Three days later
I had console support in qemu, and after another week of debugging, I had it
fully up and running on hardware.
</p>
<p>FreeBSD PowerPC64LE is now an experimental MACHINE_ARCH in base, and is
continuing to evolve at a rapid pace.
</p>
<p>Big-endian PowerPC64 is still the preferred platform for the foreseeable
future, and will not be deprecated.

	</p><p>The ure is a driver for handling the RealTek ethernet adapters,
including the RTL8153 USB 3.0 Gigabit ethernet adapters.  It is used
in many ethernet dongles and docking stations.
</p>
<p>Previous to this update, the driver was limited in speed.  In my
testing, I was only able to get ~91Mbps.  This limit was due to one
packet per USB transfer.  USB has a limit of 8000 transfers per
second (1500 bytes/pkt * 8000 pkts/sec * 8bits/byte == 96 Mbps).
This was acceptable for fast ethernet (RTL8152, 100Mbps), but with
the additional support for Gigabit ethernet, it became a bottleneck.
</p>
<p>The updates add sending and receiving multiple packets in a single
USB transfer, VLAN hardware tagging, and enable TCP and UDP
checksum offloading.  This increased the speed on gigabit ethernet
to ~940 Mbps.
</p>
<p>In doing this work, a security vulnerability was discovered in the
driver.  Due to improper setting of a device register, on some
devices, it caused packets to be fragmented when they shouldn't be
and the driver was unable to handle them correctly.  This allowed an
attacker, who could generate large frames (say, ping packets, or
large TCP transfers), to inject arbitrary packets into the network
stack.  This could allow the attacker to spoof traffic from other
machines, and bypass VLAN protections.  See the SA for more
information.
</p>
<p>As part of this work, a script was created to run tests to
validate that basic functionality of the driver (w/o options) work
properly, and then iterate over each option to make sure that they
function properly.  This will be released at some point in the
future.

	</p><p>VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible LAN) is a tunneling protocol in which Layer 2
traffic for a virtual LAN is encapsulated in UDP and transferred over
Layer 3 networks between VTEPs (VXLAN Tunnel End Points).  Traffic on
the wire has two sets of networking headers: the headers for the
encapsulation and the headers of the traffic being encapsulated.  VXLANs
are supported by if_vxlan(4) on FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>Modern NICs commonly support header checksum insertion and verification,
TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) on transmit, and RSS for load
distribution on receive.  But the default is to operate on the outermost
headers.  Some NICs can operate on the inner encapsulated frames as
well.  The commits listed above allow if_vxlan(4) to take advantage of
such NICs.
</p>
<p>r365867 and r365868 add new mbuf checksum flags and ifnet capabilities.
r365870 implements the kernel parts of the new capabilities and updates
if_vxlan(4) to make use of them.  r365871 implements driver support for
the new capabilities in cxgbe(4).
</p>
<p>VXLAN and other tunneling protocols that use UDP explicitly allow zero
checksum in the outer UDP header, even with IPv6.  r365869 adds support
for configuring one UDP/IPv6 port where zero checksums are allowed.
</p>
<p>This work was sponsored by Chelsio Communications and was implemented
and tested using T6 (Terminator 6) NICs supported by cxgbe(4).  It is
available in 13.0-CURRENT (head) right now and will be available in
12-STABLE in the future.
</p>
<p>VXLANs can be created as usual and will automatically have checksum and
TSO capabilities if the underlying physical interface supports VXLAN
stateless offloads.  Use ifconfig to list, disable, and enable checksum
capabilities on the VXLAN interface.  Use https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/
to report bugs.
</p>
<p>Future work:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Direct call into a vxlan input routine from the driver's receive routine.
</p></li>
<li><p>LRO support in if_vxlan(4).
</p></li>
<li><p>GENEVE support.

	</p><p>The following works happened in FreeBSD HEAD (some already in Q2) and were
merged for 12.2-BETA2 and include net80211 and driver updates for better 11n
and upcoming 11ac support.
</p>
<p>In more detail, this includes an ath(4) update, some run(4) 11n support, 11n for otus(4),
A-MPDU, A-MSDU, A-MPDU+A-MSDU and Fast frames options, scanning fixes,
enhanced PRIV checks for jails, restored parent device name printing,
improvements for upcoming VHT support, lots of under-the-hood infrastructure
improvements, new device IDs, and debug tools updates.
</p>
<p>If you have a chance please test before the release.
</p>
<h3>Atheros 11ac driver athp</h3>

<p>In the last three months the athp(4) port of the ath10k driver has progressed
well.  Adrian reports the following important changes:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Per-node transmit buffering was implemented, required for correct hostap
  and QCA6174 behaviour.
</p></li>
<li><p>Issues with ignoring sending some management frames got fixed; null-data
  frames were being filtered out and this caused undesirable hostap behaviour.
</p></li>
<li><p>Transmit path refactoring reduced code duplication.
</p></li>
<li><p>A fix on firmware start / VAP running tracking no longer stops
  the first VAP from coming active after VAP creation / ifconfig up.
</p></li>
<li><p>Correcting hostap mode PHY configuration now allows non-VHT stations to
  associate and correctly exchange data with a VHT AP.
</p></li>
<li><p>Addition of a crypto key configuration cache in the driver ensures the
  ieee80211_key details are available after the key is deleted; net80211
  would reuse or free the state before the driver task would finish the
  firmware command.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Newer Intel Wireless device support</h3>

<p>Initial work was done to integrate net80211 support in the LinuxKPI compat
layer to get the wireless parts going.
In addition, upstreaming code changes and working through problems and review
started on two sides.  One was trying to get mostly compile time changes
upstreamed to the iwlwifi driver.  The other is sorting out conflicting
LinuxKPI changes to not break the DRM graphics drivers.
Bjoern hopes that with some of that sorted out, he can soon go back to focus
on the wireless parts and produce a new snapshot.
</p>
<h3>rtw88 and brcmfmac</h3>

<p>As the Intel driver port and LinuxKPI advance, both the rtw88, and to a lower
degree the brcmfmac, ports benefit from that.
Bjoern lately also got a brcmfmac PCIe card and started to port support for
that.
This for the moment remains a free-time project.

	Contact: Allan Jude &lt;<a href="mailto:allanjude@freebsd.org">allanjude@freebsd.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>Zstandard (ZSTD) is a modern high-performance compression
algorithm designed to provide the compression ratios of gzip
while offering much better performance. ZSTD has been adopted
in FreeBSD for a number of other uses, including compressing
kernel crash dumps, as a replacement for gzip or bzip for
compressing log files, and for future versions of pkg(8).
</p>
<p>This effort to complete the integration of ZSTD into ZFS is
funded by the FreeBSD Foundation.
</p>
<p>During the third quarter the integrating of ZSTD into OpenZFS
was completed in the upstream OpenZFS repository, and the new
OpenZFS 2.0 codebase was imported into 13-CURRENT.
Completed milestones in this project:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Importing ZSTD 1.4.5 into OpenZFS, using the recent upstream zstd features that make it easier to embed zstd in other projects.
</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the way compression levels are tracked and inherited.
</p></li>
<li><p>Save and restore the compression level via an embedded block header.
</p></li>
<li><p>Also store the version of zstd used in the embedded block header, for future-proofing. The checksum of a block may not match if zstd is upgraded, since it may compress the block more.
</p></li>
<li><p>Add tests to ensure zstd compression and metadata survive ZFS replication.
</p></li>
<li><p>Resolve possible negative interactions with L2ARC and ZFS Native Encryption.
</p></li>
<li><p>Fix bug with L2ARC if the Compressed ARC feature is disabled.
</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the ZFS feature activation code, so that zstd cannot create pools that will panic older versions of ZFS.
</p>
</li></ul>
With these changes, upgraded pools can compress data with zstd
<p>or zstd-fast, across a wide range of different compression levels.
This will allow the storage administrator to select the
performance-vs-compression tradeoff that best suits their needs.
</p>
<p>Tasks remaining to be completed:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add a section to the FreeBSD Handbook ZFS chapter about zstd
</p></li>
<li><p>Create more documentation around selecting a suitable compression level
</p></li>
<li><p>Finish support for ZSTD in the FreeBSD boot loader (Warner Losh <a href="mailto:imp@freebsd.org" shape="rect">imp@freebsd.org</a>)

	</p><p>CheriBSD extends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and software
compartmentalization features supported by the CHERI instruction-set
extensions.  There are three architectural implementations of the
CHERI protection model: CHERI-MIPS, CHERI-RISC-V, and Arm's forthcoming
experimental Morello processor (due late 2021).  CheriBSD is a research
operating system with a stable baseline implementation into which
various new research features have been, or are currently being, merged:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arm Morello - We are preparing to open source our adaptation of
 CheriBSD to Arm's Morello architecture.  The Morello branch is being
 updated to the most recent CheriBSD baseline, and patches are in review
 for upstreaming to our open-source repository.  CheriBSD currently boots
 and runs statically linked CheriABI binaries on the Morello simulator,
 and dynamic linking support is in progress, with OS and toolchain bugs
 being worked on.  We aim to make a first CheriBSD/Morello snapshot
 available alongside other open-source Morello software in mid-October
 2020, however, our target for a more mature and usable implementation is
 December 2020.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kernel spatial memory safety (pure-capability kernel) - The current
 CheriBSD kernel is a hybrid C program where only pointers to userspace
 are CHERI capabilities. This ensures that the kernel follows the
 intent of the application runtime and cannot be used to defeat
 bounds on application pointers. We have developed and will soon
 merge a pure-capability kernel where all pointers in the kernel are
 appropriately bounded capabilities. This vastly reduces the opportunity
 for buffer overflows. This spatial memory safety lays the
 groundwork for future work such as device driver compartmentalization
 and kernel temporal safety.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Userspace heap temporal memory safety (Cornucopia) - CHERI
 capabilities provide the necessary features to enable
 robust and efficient revocation of freed pointers.  With <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/pdfs/2020oakland-cornucopia.pdf" shape="rect">Cornucopia</a>
 we have implemented a light-weight revocation framework providing
 protection from use-after-reallocation bugs with an average cost below
 2%.  We aim to bring these overheads down further over the next year and
 merge this functionality into the mainline CheriBSD.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have been working on updating the arm64 bhyve from Politehnica
 University of Bucharest to have it committed to FreeBSD. We have been
 upstreaming initial changes to help support this.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Baseline FreeBSD improvements - We are upstreaming (to FreeBSD) various
 bug fixes and tweaks for PCIe support, and support for the System MMU (SMMU)
 that will be present on the N1SDP and Morello SoCs.  We have upstreamed
 support for cross-building FreeBSD from macOS and Linux (with some
 limitations; see separate entry on crossbuilding).  We have also fixed
 implementation bugs in the RISC-V ABI.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>CHERI Documentation and Exercises</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>We have released <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-951.pdf" shape="rect">Capability
 Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture (Version 8)</a>.
 Notable changes include promotion of CHERI-RISC-V to non-experimental
 and discussion of Arm's Morello prototype.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have developed a set of <a href="https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheri-exercises" shape="rect">Adversarial
 CHERI Exercises and Missions</a> to introduce security
 researchers to CHERI protections.

<p>The FreeBSD/RISC-V project is providing support for running FreeBSD on the
<a href="https://riscv.org/" shape="rect">RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>This quarter saw several important bug fixes. A number of hangs in the system
were identified and addressed, and a bug in QEMU's implementation of the
Platform Level Interrupt Controller was fixed. This fix is included in the new
<code>devel/qemu50</code> and <code>devel/qemu-devel</code> ports.
</p>
<p>The end result of these fixes is that the test suite can now be reliably run to
completion in QEMU. The entire run takes several hours, so CI has been
configured to run the job once a day. There is active effort into reducing the
time it takes to run the entire test suite.
</p>
<p>A new u-boot port was created: <code>sysutils/u-boot-qemu-riscv64</code>. This variant can
be used as a secondary bootloader alongside OpenSBI to load and launch FreeBSD's
<code>loader(8)</code> from an EFI System Partition.
</p>
<p>Next quarter will likely bring further fixes to address some of the failing test
cases.

	</p><p>bhyve is the hypervisor included in FreeBSD and other operating systems
used to run virtual machines. When not using a boot ROM (i.e. UEFI), the
user must load the guest operating system for bhyve. For non-FreeBSD
guests, the loader is a version of GNU GRUB (a.k.a the GNU GRand Unified
Bootloader) modified to interface with bhyve. This work is an effort to
both update the base GRUB code to the latest version as well as improve
the usability on FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>The current <a href="https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/grub2-bhyve/" shape="rect">grub-bhyve</a>
is based on an older version of GRUB (circa 2015) and thus is missing
more recent additions such as XFS file system and
<a href="https://www.syslinux.org/" shape="rect">syslinux</a> support. With the update,
installing CentOS, for example, now does not require the extra step of
changing the default file system to something other than XFS.
</p>
<p>Internally, the code has been restructured to be its own "platform"
which should make it easier to keep in sync with upstream development.
The major improvement is the ability to automatically find and load the
GRUB configuration file from the guest disk image. With this change, it
is not necessary to create a device map file or specify which Linux
kernel or initrd image to use. More importantly, if the guest image
updates its GRUB configuration, for example after updating the kernel,
no changes are needed when invoking grub-bhyve. Note, this feature
requires a new "disk" option:
</p>
<p>    # grub-bhyve --disk=/zroot/vms/u18-mini/disk0.img --vm=u18-mini
</p>
<p>The automatic configuration file detection works with both GRUB
configuration files (e.g. CentOS, Ubuntu) as well as syslinux
configuration (e.g. Alpine). For the adventurous, there is experimental
support for Fedora's BootLoaderSpec (a.k.a. <code>blscfg</code>) on the blscfg
branch of the grub-bhyve Git repository.
</p>
<p>The code has been tested on a few Linux variants, but it would benefit
from wider testing (and bug reports!). The new version does not have a
Port but is easily built on FreeBSD. After cloning / downloading the
source, run:
</p>
<p>    $ PYTHON=python3.7 ./bootstrap
    $ MAKE=gmake ./configure --with-platform=bhyve
    $ gmake
</p>
<p>The resulting binary, <code>grub-bhyve</code>, will be in the <code>grub-core/</code>
directory. If you have success or troubles with it, please let me know.

	</p><p>The KDE on FreeBSD project aims to package all of the software
produced by the KDE Community for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma,
an IDE with the name <a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/" shape="rect">KDevelop</a>,
a PIM suite known as <a href="https://kontact.kde.org/" shape="rect">Kontact</a>
and hundreds of other applications that can be used on
any FreeBSD machine.
</p>
<p>With the continuation of the ever-so-peculiar era of
almost-only-online, the KDE community has shifted gears
and also gone for online events. The yearly conference,
<a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2020/" shape="rect">Akademy</a>,
was conducted online over video calls.
Meanwhile, software continues to be released,
so this quarter the kde@ team:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put the beta of the next version of KDE Plasma, scheduled for
  official release in October 2020, into the
  <a href="https://community.kde.org/FreeBSD/Setup/Area51" shape="rect">Area51 development</a> tree.
  Area51 is a fork of the FreeBSD ports tree where new development for
  KDE ports happens.
</p></li>
<li><p>The monthly regular updates to the KDE Plasma desktop landed on-time
  and safely.
</p></li>
<li><p>With three months in a quarter, there were also three releases of
  KDE Frameworks 5, including a new framework for handling DAV jobs.
</p></li>
<li><p>The June applications update and its .1 release landed a bit late,
  but brings with it the usual raft of updates to KDE applications and libraries,
</p></li>
<li><p>A new <a href="https://www.digikam.org/" shape="rect">Digikam</a> release, which arrived in
  the ports tree on the day of its release.
</p></li>
<li><p>A new <a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/" shape="rect">KDevelop</a> release arrived a day
  after its release. This update contains a number of crash fixes
  for refactoring support.
</p></li>
<li><p>Qt was updated to Qt 5.15, the last in the Qt5 series and an LTS
  version. Bugfix releases are expected, but the next major Qt will
  be Qt 6.
</p>
</li></ul>
On the infrastructure front, August saw some minor updates to CMake and ninja.
<p>As usual, kde@ continues to support the work of xorg@ and gnome@ in maintaining
the Free Desktop stack on FreeBSD, including XOrg, poppler, and xdg-utils.
A new <code>MAINTAINER</code> group, desktop@, has been created to provide
shared ownership of that shared stack.
</p>
<p>With Python2 deprecation looming, the build system for QtWebEngine --
itself a fork of Chromium -- is becoming a pressing issue in Q4
and will no doubt chew up a lot of time in the coming months.

	</p><p>The Doc New Generation project aims to convert the website and all
existing documentation to Hugo/AsciiDoctor. Right now almost
everything is converted as you can see in the repositories.
</p>
<p>The objective of using Hugo and AsciiDoctor is to reduce the
learning curve and let people to start quickly with our documentation
system. Other benefits of using Hugo is that we can use other
technologies aside from AsciiDoctor, like MarkDown, RST, Pandoc, etc.
</p>
<p>The remaining tasks include:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Finish the conversion of some books to AsciiDoctor.
</p></li>
<li><p>Get some tweaks in the CSS to be responsive.
</p></li>
<li><p>Add AsciiDoctor extensions to create an index of tables and figures.
</p></li>
<li><p>Make a general review.
</p>
</li></ul>
The dates for making the migration have yet to be discussed.

<p>Patches, comments and objections are always welcome.

	</p><p>pot is a jail management tool that <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03.html#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver" shape="rect">also supports orchestration through nomad</a>.
</p>
<p>Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: A repository of pot flavours and complete images for usage with pot.
</p>
<p>In the last quarter, an initial set of Nomad, Consul and Traefik images has been created that are sufficient to run a simple virtual datacenter out of the box.  <br clear="none" />
<a href="https://honeyguide.eu/posts/virtual-dc1/" shape="rect">A three-part article series explaining how to set this up</a> is also available now.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, ready-made images suitable for scheduling via Nomad and Consul in such an environment have been created, e.g. a BackupPC or a Postfix Backup MX service.
</p>
<p>Future plans include additional images and exposing more configuration options in the existing images to allow a more flexible usage.
</p>
<p>Beside general feedback and tests, additional flavours and patches are very welcome!

	</p><p>Since out last status report a few years ago, the puppet@ team regularly
updated the various Puppet ports to follow upstream releases of Puppet
4, Puppet 5 and Puppet 6.  Puppet 4 was removed when it reached EOL.
</p>
<p>More recently, an effort was made to enhance Facter 4 so that it can be
used as a drop-in replacement of Facter 3 on FreeBSD.  Facter 4 is a
Ruby rewrite of Facter 3, the C++ rewrite of Facter 2 which was
initially in Ruby.  As a consequence we have two ports for Facter:
sysutils/facter is the C++ implementation (Facter 3) and
sysutils/rubygems-facter is the Ruby implementation (updated from Facter
2 to Facter 4 a few weeks ago).  The Puppet 5 and Puppet 6 ports already
allow to choose which version of Facter to use.  Facter 4 will be the
default version of Facter with Puppet 7 which is expected to be released
soon.
</p>
<p>We are getting ready to add a port for Puppet 7 as sysutils/puppet7
when it is available, along with PuppetServer 7 (sysutils/puppetserver7),
and PuppetDB 7 (databases/puppetdb7).
</p>
<p>Regarding orchestration, most Marionette Collective ports have been
deprecated for a long time, and the last component sysutils/mcollective
is expected to be deprecated soon: Marionette Collective was not shipped
anymore with Puppet 6 and Bolt has been made available as a lightweight
replacement.
</p>
<p>Bolt is already available in the ports tree as sysutils/rubygems-bolt),
but if you are using Marionette Collective, you are invited to look into
Choria which will reach the ports tree soon as sysutils/choria.  Choria
is a direct evolution of Marionette Collective allowing a smooth
transition from MCollective.  Once Choria is available in the ports
tree, Marionette Collective will be deprecated.

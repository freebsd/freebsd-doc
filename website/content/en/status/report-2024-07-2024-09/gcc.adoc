This quarter the main news is about the new GCC releases:

* package:lang/gcc11[] has been updated to 11.5.0, which is the last GCC 11 planned released;
* package:lang/gcc12[] has been updated to 12.4.0;
* package:lang/gcc13[] has been updated to 13.3.0;
* package:lang/gcc14[] has been updated to 14.2.0.

The link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=281091[exp-run] to update GCC default version from 13 to 14 has started.
As usual, thanks to everyone involved.

If you maintain any of the affected ports or want to give a hand preparing and testing some patches, please consider trying adding `-fpermissive` to `CFLAGS` to affected ports: GCC 14 has transformed some warnings into errors, which is the cause of many of the failed builds.
The `-fpermissive` flag switches those errors back to warnings.

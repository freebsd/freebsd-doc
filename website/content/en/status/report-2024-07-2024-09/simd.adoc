The porting effort of the SIMD enhanced libc string functions from amd64 to
aarch64 has been successfully completed. There are now optimized
implementations for 16 libc string functions in addition to those with
implementations already available as part of the ARM optimized subroutines
library.
There is also a presentation regarding the general method for these
methods from EuroBSDCon 2024 available on YouTube with a short description in
the end of how the porting has been done with regards to the aarch64 architecture.

These enhancements significantly improve performance of string functions for
all FreeBSD systems on the aarch64 platform.

The code is currently undergoing acceptance testing in the form of an exp-run
building all the ports, once without and once with the patch set applied to see
if it has caused any new failures.

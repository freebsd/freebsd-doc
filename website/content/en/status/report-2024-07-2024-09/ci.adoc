In the fourth quarter of 2024, we worked with the project contributors and developers to address their testing requirements.
Concurrently, we collaborated with external projects and companies to enhance their products by testing more on FreeBSD.

Important completed tasks:

* Update main and stable/14 build environment to 14.1-RELEASE

Work in progress tasks:

* Improving the [.filename]#src/tests/ci# work to support running test suites
* Merging link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D36257[Pre-commit CI with CIRRUS-CI]
* Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing and pull/merge-request based system (to support the link:https://gitlab.com/bsdimp/freebsd-workflow[workflow working group])
  * Proof of concept system is in progress.
* Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release artifacts as release engineering does, starting with snapshot builds
* Simplifying CI/test environment setting up for contributors and developers
* Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental jobs on it
* Redesigning the hardware test lab and adding more hardware for testing

Open or queued tasks:

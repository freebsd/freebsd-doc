A new project trying to make FreeBSD usable on the Pinephone Pro has been started during August.

The current FreeBSD RELEASE images already boot on a Pinephone Pro, but no screen output or other devices are supported. The aim is to step by step support additional components so that the device one day might be usable as a highly mobile FreeBSD device.

Over the last few weeks, the groundwork has been implemented like getting used to the device, cross-compiling and booting a 15.0-CURRENT custom kernel as well as toggling the LEDs (red/green/blue in the front).

FreeBSD currently does not seem to support any of the components of the Pinephone Pro out of the box, so the next steps will be to simplify the development process also for other who might be interested to join the effort.
The first item to be worked on is supporting text output on the screen. 

Additional feedback and testers are welcome.

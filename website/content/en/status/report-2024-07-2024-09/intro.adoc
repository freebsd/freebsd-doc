Here is the third 2024 status report, with ?? entries.

Unfortunately we are late this quarter, just like last quarter.
As our readers know, many FreeBSD contributors are volunteers, so it is natural that less important deadlines like the status reports ones are not always met.
Indeed, if you are not a FreeBSD contributor yet, please consider joining us: you could help lighten someone's burden while learning new skills, working side by side with developers all over the world.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.

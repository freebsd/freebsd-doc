The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

The Team managed 13.4-RELEASE, leading to the final RELEASE build and announcement in September.
Planning has started for the upcoming 14.2-RELEASE cycle.

The Release Engineering Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the *main*, *stable/14*, and *stable/13* branches.

The project to port FreeBSD over to the Pinephone Pro is progressing. The                                             
aim of this project is to step by step support components of the Pinephone                                            
Pro in FreeBSD so that the device one day might be usable as a highly                                                 
mobile FreeBSD device.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                      
In this quarter, a new development release has been made available for flashing
and testing on a PinePhone Pro. It includes a newly added touch driver, and a
minimal desktop environment with an on-screen keyboard. You can simply flash
this build to an SD card and boot it up, provided you have the correct version
of U-boot bootloader installed (details at the repository). The image also
contains the kernel and drivers source code, along with Vim editor and build
tools, allowing for development of drivers on-device.

To facilitate testing and driver development, network access has been enabled
via the headphone jack (using the headphone-to-USB-serial adapter). It works by
using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to access the network via your PC. Details
of setting this up are in the repository README file.

Work is now under way to develop USB and WiFi drivers. As always, contributions
in the form of testing, feedback, upstreaming, driver development, or just
words of encouragement are welcome.

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work and communications.
In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

* Installed a new mirror in Sydney, Australia hosted by IX Australia
* Fixed CI cluster hardware failure
* Set up a new internal monitoring system
* Regular cluster-wide software upgrades
* Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts

Work in progress:

* Work with the PowerPC team to improve the package builders, universal, and reference machines.
* Plan Hardware refresh, and fixing misc failures in each sites
* Improve the package building infrastructure
* Review the service jails and service administrators operation
* Working with doceng@ to improve deployment of https://www.freebsd.org and https://docs.freebsd.org
* Improve the web service architecture
* Improve the cluster backup plan
* Improve the log analysis system

We are looking for an additional full mirror site (five servers) in Europe.
See link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/generic-mirror-layout[generic mirrored layout] for our needs.
Offers of additional single-server mirrors (see link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Teams/clusteradm/tiny-mirror[tiny mirror]) are always welcome too, especially in Europe.

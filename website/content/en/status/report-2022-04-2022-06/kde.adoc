The KDE on FreeBSD project packages the software from the KDE Community, along with dependencies and related software, for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@ as well, building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver graphics-based desktop machine.
The notes below describe *mostly* ports for KDE, but also include items of import to the entire desktop stack.

==== KDE Stack

KDE Gear releases happen each quarter, KDE Plasma updates once a month, and KDE Frameworks have a new release each month as well.
These (large) updates land shortly after their upstream release and are not listed separately.

* *astro/kstars* latest release 3.5.9.
* *deskutils/grantleetheme* got an entry in UPDATING because of some unusual changes to the installed structure of the port.
* *deskutils/kalendar* joined the KDE Gear releases.
* *devel/okteta* updates to the binary (and octal and hexadecimal) data viewer and editor.
* *finance/kraft* needed specific build-fixes for newer KDE Frameworks.
* *games/gcompris-qt* expanded, new releases, and now supports more image formats (needed for some activities).
* *graphics/digikam* no longer needs a SQL server during the build.
* *graphics/krita* was updated to 5.0.5, likely the last 5.0 version.
* *math/labplot* has a huge number of new features in recent releases, well worth looking at if you need any kind of data-plotting.
* *net-im/ruqola* was updated.
  This is a Qt-styled Rocket chat application.
* *www/falkon* joined the KDE Gear releases.

==== Related Applications

* *archivers/quazip* was updated.
* *deskutils/semantik* updated.
* *devel/py-qt5-pyqt* updated so that the port now pulls in DBus as well.
  DBus is needed by nearly all desktop Qt applications, including those written in Python.
* *devel/qcoro* had build issues on certain FreeBSD versions, resolved.
* *devel/qtcreator* updated with each new release.
* *devel/qt5* had its infrastructure updated in ports so it does not produce strange error messages during de-installation.
* *graphics/ksnip* and related libraries updated to recent releases.
* Matrix clients Nheko (*net-im/nheko*) and Neochat (*net-im/neochat*) were updated following releases and library bumps.
* *x11/rsibreak* updated; helps prevent injury while writing long quarterly reports.

==== Elsewhere

* *devel/appstream* update supports more application-information.
* *devel/cmake* prefers generic python3 over versioned-python3, if users have multiple python3 ports *and* lang/python3 installed.
* *devel/dbus* updated.
* *graphics/poppler* updated several times.
* *graphics/ImageMagick* (both 6 and 7) updated several times.
* *multimedia/gstreamer* updated.

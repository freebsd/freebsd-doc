OpenSSH, a suite of remote login and file transfer tools, was updated from version 8.8p1 to 9.0p1 in the FreeBSD base system.

It has not yet been merged to the stable/13 and stable/12 branches.
I anticipate doing so in July.

*NOTE*:
OpenSSH 9.0p1 switches scp(1) from using the legacy scp/rcp protocol to using the SFTP protocol by default.
The `-O` flag is available to use the previous protocol instead.

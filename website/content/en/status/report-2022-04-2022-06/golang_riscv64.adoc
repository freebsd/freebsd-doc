Work has been done to port go on FreeBSD riscv64 which builds and passes all run.bash tests, including cgo (tested under QEMU and on Unmatched).
A pull request is created upstream and the proposal has been added to the active column of the proposals project and will be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

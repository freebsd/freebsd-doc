Here is the second quarterly report of 2022, with 26 reports included.

This quarter the quarterly team managed to publish the report much faster and, hopefully, with much fewer mistakes.
If however you notice some errors, please report them so that we can correct them and also add some automatic checks in our tools to prevent them in the future and stay as efficient as possible in the publication process.

We would also like to remind you that if for any reason you need more time to submit a quarterly report, the team will wait for you, but please warn us so that we are aware that some report is still missing.

Many thanks to all those that have chosen to share their work with the FreeBSD community through the quarterly reports.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the status report team.

The overall project aims to bring support for newer chipsets to FreeBSD currently using LinuxKPI compat code backed by native net80211 and kernel code.
In addition the aim is to continue work towards supporting newer wireless standards.
During the second quarter 40 commits went into FreeBSD CURRENT.
With more users trying multiple drivers support time has also gone up.

An earlier version of the Intel iwlwifi-derived wireless driver shipped in 13.1-RELEASE bringing this work into a first FreeBSD release.
The iwlwifi driver and firmware were since updated in CURRENT and stable/13 again as part of ongoing development.
Changes in files shared with the upstream Intel Linux version of the driver are now less than 400 lines.
Lately a longer-standing problem for older chipsets was (hopefully) solved allowing iwm(4)-supported cards to work with iwlwifi(4) again after almost three months.
The main focus for the project until the end of the year will most exclusively be getting us to contemporary speeds.

On April 1st, using the same LinuxKPI infrastructure built mostly with the iwlwifi work, Realtek's rtw88(4) driver got committed into CURRENT.
Due to an issue with DMA the next weeks a workaround was developed and put into the tree so users no longer have to patch the kernel.
The driver still needs a tunable set in loader.conf for machines with more than 4GB of physical memory.
This tunable allowed the driver to be merged to stable/13 in June followed by further updates in CURRENT and stable/13.
As the USB parts for rtw88 based chipsets are prepared to be included in Linux, work has started (needing more time) to prepare FreeBSD to be able to support the USB parts as well.

During the last months Realtek's rtw89 has already been compiling and remains a work in progress to run stably and associate before it can be enabled in CURRENT.

Thanks to all the users for testing and reporting back, patiently waiting for the next update, bugfix, or just a reply from me.
It is a great pleasure to work with you!
Keep sending the bug reports to me, but remember that your thanks should go to the FreeBSD Foundation for making most of this possible.

For the latest state of the development, please follow the freebsd-wireless mailing list and check the wiki pages.

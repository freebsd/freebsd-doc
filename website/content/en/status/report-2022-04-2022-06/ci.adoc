The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the FreeBSD project.
The CI system checks the committed changes can be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the newly built results.
The artifacts from those builds are archived in the link:https://artifact.ci.FreeBSD.org[artifact server] for further testing and debugging needs.
The CI team members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.

During the second quarter of 2022, we continued working with the contributors and developers in the project to fulfill their testing needs and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies to improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important completed tasks:

* Fixed the hardware failure issue of the CI cluster

Work in progress tasks:

* Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing (to support the link:https://gitlab.com/bsdimp/freebsd-workflow[workflow working group])
* Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release artifacts as release engineering does
* Testing and merging pull requests in link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ci/pulls[the FreeBSD-ci repo]
* Simplifying CI/test environment setting up for contributors and developers
* Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental jobs on it
* Organizing the scripts in freebsd-ci repository to prepare for merging to src repository
* Updating documents on wiki

Open or queued tasks:

* Collecting and sorting link:https://hackmd.io/@FreeBSD-CI/freebsd-ci-todo[CI tasks and ideas]
* Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests
* Implementing use of bare-metal hardware to run test suites
* Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT
* Planning to run ztest tests
* Adding more external toolchain related jobs
* Improving maturity of the hardware lab and adding more hardware for testing
* Helping more software get FreeBSD support in its CI pipeline (Wiki pages: link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/3rdPartySoftwareCI[3rdPartySoftwareCI], link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/HostedCI[HostedCI])
* Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

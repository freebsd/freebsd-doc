The goal of this project is to improve FreeBSD's ability to execute unmodified Linux binaries.
Current support status of specific Linux applications is being tracked at the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/LinuxApps[Linux app status Wiki page].

Implementation of the Y2k38 Linux project is mostly finished; all '*_time64()' system calls are committed.

The state of the arm64 Linux emulation layer was brought to the state of the amd64 Linux emulation layer:
i.e., implemented the vDSO, machine dependent futexes, signals delivery.

The thread affinity system calls were modified to implement Linux semantics.

In total, over 50 bugs were fixed; glibc-2.35 tests suite reports less than 80 failed tests.

All changes in the Linux emulation layer are merged to the stable/13 branch.

Initial support for fancy Linux system call tracing has been added to libsysdecode and kdump.
There is ongoing work to make tracing more syscalls work.

The Pantheon desktop environment is designed for elementary OS.
It builds on GNOME technologies (such as Mutter, GNOME Shell, GTK 3 and 4) and it is written in Vala.

The goal is to have a new desktop for users.
Some features are not well supported, but we can have full session.

The repository contains Mk/Uses framework `elementary.mk`, official applications, and curated ports which depend of `x11-toolkits/granite` (total of 56 new ports).

I have submitted several patches, especially:

* `x11-toolkits/granite7`
* `devel/libgee` update to 0.20.5 link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=262893[bug #262893]
* `sysutils/bamf` update to 0.5.6 link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=264203[bug #264203]

==== Open tasks

* Add support of user settings (it is very Ubuntu-centric)
* Finish porting wingpanel-indicator-power (power management)

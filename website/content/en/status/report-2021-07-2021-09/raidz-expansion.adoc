==== Project

This feature allows disks to be added one at a time to a RAID-Z group, expanding its capacity incrementally.
This feature is especially useful for small pools (typically with only one RAID-Z group), where there isn't sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole new RAID-Z group (typically doubling the number of disks).

FreeBSD's ZFS implementation comes from the OpenZFS project.
This work will be integrated into the OpenZFS repo, with support for FreeBSD and Linux.

==== Status

The work is functionally complete, and a pull request has been opened.

==== Remaining Work

Remaining work includes some code cleanup, design documentation, addressing test failures.

We also need to solicit code reviewers and respond to code review feedback.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

Throughout the third quarter, several development snapshots builds were released for the *main*, *stable/13*, and *stable/12* branches.
More work had been done on various release-related tooling following the conversion from Subversion to Git.
Additionally, the team had drafted the proposed schedule for the upcoming 12.3-RELEASE.

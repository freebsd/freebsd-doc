Microchip's LAN7430 and LAN7431 are PCIe Gigabit Ethernet interface ICs, with
an integrated PHY (LAN7430) or RGMII interface (LAN7431).

In 2019 Gerald ND Aryeetey, a FreeBSD Foundation intern, developed the mgb(4)
driver for these devices.  It was added to the tree but not yet connected to
the build.  Since it was committed a number of sweeping iflib changes were made,
which included updates to mgb(4).

I have addressed some outstanding issues in the driver, and have now added the
module to the build.  It is available in -CURRENT snapshot images.  The driver
is functional, although some additional work is still needed.  In particular,
configuration of the Receive Filtering Engine, and VLAN and RX/TX checksum
offload are required.  Caveats and notes are described in the man page.

I am very interested in feedback and test results.

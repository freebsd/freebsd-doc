The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the FreeBSD project.
The CI system checks the committed changes can be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the newly built results.
The artifacts from those builds are archived in the link:https://artifact.ci.FreeBSD.org[artifact server] for further testing and debugging needs.
The CI team members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.

During the third quarter of 2021, we continued working with the contributors and developers in the project to fulfil their testing needs and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies to improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important changes:

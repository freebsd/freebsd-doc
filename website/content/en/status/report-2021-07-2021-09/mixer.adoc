This project is an attempt to improve the capabilities of the OSS sound mixer
on FreeBSD. This means a new mixer(3) library, a complete rewrite of mixer(8),
and updates to sound(4).

Development started during Google Summer of Code 2021, but will likely continue
independently.

Applied changes:

* Implement OSS mixer (un)muting ioctls in sound(4)
(link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=0f8dafb45859569aa36b63ca2bb4a1c35c970d1e[commit 0f8dafb45859]).
* Implement playback/recording mode sysctl

* Implement mixer(3) and new version of mixer(8)
(link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=903873ce15600fc02a0ea42cbf888cff232b411d[commit 903873ce1560]).

Patches, comments and discussion are all welcome.

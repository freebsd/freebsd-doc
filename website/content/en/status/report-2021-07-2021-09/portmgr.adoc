The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

There are currently 46,500 ports in the Ports Tree according to FreshPorts.
The open PR count for ports is currently 2,588, of which 608 are unassigned.
The last quarter saw 9,833 commits on the "main" branch by 148 committers and 743 commits on the quarterly branch by 54 committers.
Compared to 2021q2, activity mostly remained the same, the PR counts increased a bit but there were also more commits to the quarterly branch.

During 2021q3, we welcomed Daniel Engberg (diizzy@) and Yasuhiro Kimura (yasu@), and we said goodbye to culot@ and grog@ after their commit bits were taken in for safekeeping.

Two new uses were introduced: angr to help with testing Python-related ports and mlt to help depending on mlt, a multimedia framework for TV broadcasting.
Ruby saw minor updates for the 2.6, 2.7, and 3.0 series.

The "big" packages were also updated: pkg to 1.17.2, Firefox to 93.0, and Chromium to 92.0.4515.159.

As usual, exp-runs were performed by antoine@ but only those of July were recorded.
There were 5 exp-runs to test adding CLOCK_\*_COARSE compatibility definitions for Linux and to test ports updates.

Furthermore, rene@ gave a presentation "portmgr: behind the scenes" at EuroBSDCon 2021 about how portmgr came to be and its daily activities.

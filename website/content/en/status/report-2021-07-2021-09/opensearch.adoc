OpenSearch is a community-driven, open-source search and analytics suite derived from Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2 & Kibana 7.10.2. It consists of a search engine daemon, OpenSearch, and a visualization and user interface, OpenSearch Dashboards. OpenSearch enables people to easily ingest, secure, search, aggregate, view, and analyze data. These capabilities are popular for use cases such as application search, log analytics, and more. With OpenSearch people benefit from having an open-source product they can use, modify, extend, monetize, and resell how they want.

After the release of OpenSearch 1.0.0, a FreeBSD OpenSearch team was created to coordinate the efforts for porting it to FreeBSD.  Because ElasticSearch 7 and Kibana 7 were already in the ports tree, we could rely on these ports to get started quickly (kudos to the elastic@ team) and could focus on the parts that already changed between the previous codebase and the fork.  The ports have been committed to the FreeBSD ports tree as textproc/opensearch and textproc/opensearch-dashboards, and currently provide the latest 1.0.1 version of OpenSearch.

The ports have been thoroughly tested in our testing environments and on some production workloads, but we are actively looking for feedback from users.  Feel free to send us an email to report successes or failures.

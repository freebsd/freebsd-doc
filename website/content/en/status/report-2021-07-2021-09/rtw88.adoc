This project aims to bring in support for Realtek's rtw88 chips.

With the growing LinuxKPI compatibility code an initial port of the Realtek rtw88 driver was done.
This gives us support for a second driver after Intel and helps to validate and grow the LinuxKPI code base.
Changes and overall time needed to get the driver compiling were very little.
At the moment we are seeing DMA issues which prevent most people from loading firmware or using the driver later on.

Thanks to everyone who was brave enough to give this initial code drop a try.

While this is a leasure time project we would love to better support Realtek wireless devices and will keep working on this.

For the latest state of the development or code, please follow the referenced wiki page or the freebsd-wireless mailing list.

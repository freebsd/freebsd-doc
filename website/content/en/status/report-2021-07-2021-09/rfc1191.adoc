=== RFC1191 support in IPSEC tunnels

Contact: Wojciech Macek <wma@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team has been working on providing support for RFC1191 in IPSEC tunnels.
This allows the PMTUD algorithm to dynamically discover the maximum path MTU the tunnel
can handle and update tunnel parameters accordingly.
As a result, a better performance can be observed as there is no need for packet fragmentation.

The newly introduced rework includes:

* NEEDFRAG support for IPSEC link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=d9d59bb1af142e7575032dd6c51fc64580de84df[commit d9d59bb1af1]

The Intel Wireless driver update project aims to bring support for newer chipsets along with mac80211 LinuxKPI compat code.
The dual-licensed Intel driver code was ported in the past for the iwm(4) native driver; using the LinuxKPI compat framework allows us to use the driver directly, with only very minor modificationsi that we hope will be incorporated into the original driver.

After the initial snapshot at the end of June, another snapshot was released in early September.
Thank you to everyone testing on CURRENT and reporting back.

While we keep updating the driver and all the compat code needed for that, the focus now is on stability and adding support for newer 802.11 standards.
The driver is currently set to 11a/b/g and 11n will be next before we look at 11ac.

We are currently trying to get as much into FreeBSD as is possible and makes sense.
Full integration into FreeBSD main is waiting for a policy update.

For the latest state of the development or code, please follow the referenced wiki page or the freebsd-wireless mailing list.
We expect to release another snapshot soon and hope to also support stable/13 again with that one.

This report covers FreeBSD related projects for the period between July and September, and is the third of four planned reports for 2021, and contains 42 entries.

The third quarter of 2021 was quite active in lots of different areas, so the report covers a bunch of interesting work including but not limited to boot performance, compile-time analysis, hole-punching support, various drivers, ZFS raidz expansion, an update to the sound mixer, and many more.

Regrettably, the status report got a bit delayed, but we hope that the aphorism better late than never can apply here.

Yours, +
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, with status hat on.

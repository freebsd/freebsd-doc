The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to advancing FreeBSD through both technical and non-technical support.
Funded entirely by donations, the Foundation supports software development, infrastructure, security, and collaboration efforts; organizes events and developer summits; provides educational resources; and represents the FreeBSD Project in legal matters.

Here are some of the ways we supported FreeBSD in the second quarter of 2025.

==== Advocacy

Advocacy work in the 2nd quarter of 2025 included hosting events, launching a new series of video guides and bringing on a new Marketing Coordinator.
Florine Kamdem brings social media, branding, and IT skills.
She uses storytelling to craft digital campaigns that spark interest and build connection within the community.

* Held the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202506[June 2025 FreeBSD Developer Summit] June 11-12, 2025, co-located with link:https://www.bsdcan.org/2025[BSDCan 2025].
  Videos of the all day stream are available on the Project's https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeBSDProject[YouTube Channel], and videos of the individual talks will be available in the coming weeks.
* Finalized our Silver Sponsorship of https://2025.eurobsdcon.org/[EuroBSDcon 2025], held in Zagreb, Croatia; September 25-28, 2025.

==== OS Improvements

The Foundation continued to support two major initiatives: the Laptop Support and Usability project (in collaboration with link:https://www.ql-research.com/[Quantum Leap Research]) and an <<_infrastructure_modernization,infrastructure modernization project>> commissioned by the link:https://www.sovereign.tech/[Sovereign Tech Agency].
For background on both efforts, see the link:https://www.freebsd.org/status/report-2025-01-2025-03/#_freebsd_foundation[2025Q1 quarterly status report].

Throughout the quarter, there were 536 `src`, 64 `ports`, and 41 `doc` commits that identified the FreeBSD Foundation as a sponsor.

Here is a sampling of that work and other sponsored efforts:

* Various improvements to libvirt's support for bhyve, including:
** An initial port of the libvirt integration testing project, libvirt-tck, enabling test execution against libvirt's bhyve driver on FreeBSD.
** Enhancements to the bhyve driver to improve compatibility and testability.
** Support for virtio-rnd devices, NVRAM configuration, and extended domain usage statistics (under review).
** Initial support for man:pf[4]-based NAT networking (under review).
* Improved handling of tlsbase (thread-local storage) on amd64, making it more reliable across context switches and benefiting applications that manually manage TLS, such as Wine.
* Runtime linker improvements, including support for the -z initfirst flag.
  This addresses longstanding issues with RTLD_DEEPBIND and provides better control over symbol resolution and initialization order in dynamically linked applications.
* Enhanced ptrace usability by enabling transient PT_ATTACH behavior.
  This reduces friction for debugging tools and eliminates spurious EINTR errors that could interrupt or break tracing workflows.
* kqueue introspection support by extending man:procstat[1] to report kqueue state, improving observability into how processes use kernel event notification mechanisms
* Design and implementation of EXTERROR, a kernel-level flag mechanism that signals when extended error information is available.
  This enables applications to retrieve more detailed diagnostics beyond standard error codes.

The Foundation is managing FreeBSD's participation in the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)] program.

==== Continuous Integration and Workflow Improvement

As part of our continued support of the FreeBSD Project, the Foundation supports a full-time staff member dedicated to improving the Project's continuous integration system and test infrastructure.

==== Legal/FreeBSD IP

The Foundation owns the FreeBSD trademarks, and it is our responsibility to protect them.
We also provide legal support for the core team to investigate questions that arise.

The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to advancing FreeBSD through both technical and non-technical support.
Funded entirely by donations, the Foundation supports software development, infrastructure, security, and collaboration efforts; organizes events and developer summits; provides educational resources; and represents the FreeBSD Project in legal matters.

Here are some of the ways we supported FreeBSD in the second quarter of 2025.

==== Advocacy

Advocacy work in the 2nd quarter of 2025 included hosting events, launching a new series of video guides and bringing on a new Marketing Coordinator.
Florine Kamdem brings social media, branding, and IT skills.
She uses storytelling to craft digital campaigns that spark interest and build connection within the community.

* Held the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202506[June 2025 FreeBSD Developer Summit] June 11-12, 2025, co-located with link:https://www.bsdcan.org/2025[BSDCan 2025].
  Videos of the all day stream are available on the Project's https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeBSDProject[YouTube Channel], and videos of the individual talks will be available in the coming weeks.
* Finalized our Silver Sponsorship of https://2025.eurobsdcon.org/[EuroBSDcon 2025], held in Zagreb, Croatia; September 25-28, 2025.

==== OS Improvements

The Foundation continued to support two major initiatives: the Laptop Support and Usability project (in collaboration with link:https://www.ql-research.com/[Quantum Leap Research]) and an <<_infrastructure_modernization,infrastructure modernization project>> commissioned by the link:https://www.sovereign.tech/[Sovereign Tech Agency].
For background on both efforts, see the link:https://www.freebsd.org/status/report-2025-01-2025-03/#_freebsd_foundation[2025Q1 quarterly status report].

Throughout the quarter, there were 536 `src`, 64 `ports`, and 41 `doc` commits that identified the FreeBSD Foundation as a sponsor.

Here is a sampling of that work and other sponsored efforts:

* Various improvements to libvirt's support for bhyve, including:
** An initial port of the libvirt integration testing project, libvirt-tck, enabling test execution against libvirt's bhyve driver on FreeBSD.
** Enhancements to the bhyve driver to improve compatibility and testability.
** Support for virtio-rnd devices, NVRAM configuration, and extended domain usage statistics (under review).
** Initial support for man:pf[4]-based NAT networking (under review).
* Improved handling of tlsbase (thread-local storage) on amd64, making it more reliable across context switches and benefiting applications that manually manage TLS, such as Wine.
* Runtime linker improvements, including support for the -z initfirst flag.
  This addresses longstanding issues with RTLD_DEEPBIND and provides better control over symbol resolution and initialization order in dynamically linked applications.
* Enhanced ptrace usability by enabling transient PT_ATTACH behavior.
  This reduces friction for debugging tools and eliminates spurious EINTR errors that could interrupt or break tracing workflows.
* kqueue introspection support by extending man:procstat[1] to report kqueue state, improving observability into how processes use kernel event notification mechanisms
* Design and implementation of EXTERROR, a kernel-level flag mechanism that signals when extended error information is available.
  This enables applications to retrieve more detailed diagnostics beyond standard error codes.

==== Continuous Integration and Workflow Improvement

As part of our continued support of the FreeBSD Project, the Foundation supports a full-time staff member dedicated to <<_continuous_integration,improving the Project's continuous integration system and test infrastructure>>.

==== Legal/FreeBSD IP

The Foundation owns the FreeBSD trademarks, and it is our responsibility to protect them.
We also provide legal support for the core team to investigate questions that arise.

The link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=281091[exp-run to update GCC default version from 13 to 14] is still suspended.
As a reminder, it has been noticed that FreeBSD 13.4 lacks symbols that are used by GCC 14 for linking; please see https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=284499#c0 for a more detailed explanation.
The symbols are however already present in higher FreeBSD versions.
At the time this report is written, FreeBSD 13.4 is expected to go out of support soon (on June 30th), so it has been decided that it is preferable to suspend the exp-run until then.
Thus it will get back on track on July 1st.

Meanwhile, GCC 15 has been released.
As usual, the new port package package:lang/gcc15[] has been created, as well as package:lang/gcc16-devel[] that tracks the latest GCC development.

More bugs have been addressed.
Bug https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=285711[285711] about issues with some CPUTYPE values has been fixed with a temporary workaround.
The workaround will be needed until commit gitref:22e564c74eb20e14bd93fd9fdde20e38a29cfcf1[repository=src] is included in all supported FreeBSD releases.

A build failure has been found on aarch64 machines, see bug link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=282797[282797].
A fix has been found and is about to be submitted upstream.

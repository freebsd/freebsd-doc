The `bsd-user-4-linux` project ports BSD user-mode emulation for QEMU to Linux.
The primary goal is to enable unmodified FreeBSD binaries to run on modern Linux systems.
Additionally, the project aims to provide multi-platform container images with a functional FreeBSD environment and ready-to-use GitHub Actions templates.

News:

* Two new pull requests have been received since the initial project announcement:
  ** Diagnostic output cleanup;
  ** kqueue() support using libkqueue library on Linux.
* Latest set of changes has been pulled from the Warner's qemu-bsd-user project bringing Qemu version to 9.2.0 along with some fixes and improvements.

Current Status:

* The initial port successfully runs `make -jN buildworld`.
* Most command-line tools are working as expected (`sh`, `bash`, `find`, `grep`, `git`, `clang`, etc).
* A link:https://github.com/sobomax/qemu-bsd-user-l4b/actions[GitHub Actions pipeline] builds x86_64 emulation images for:
  ** linux/386
  ** linux/amd64
  ** linux/arm/v5
  ** linux/arm64/v8
* Pre-build Docker container with FreeBSD 14.1 binary world is created and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.

* Special pre-built "admin" container with Linux user-mode quemu binary for the FreeBSD/amd64 emulation is also published at the GHCR.

Next Steps:
* Bump FreeBSD version to 14.3;
* Rebase onto Qemu 10.0.x.

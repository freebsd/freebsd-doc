=== Source Management Team

Contact: srcmgr <srcmgr@FreeBSD.org>

The srcmgr@ team aims to make src developers more productive, and works to manage the large number of bug reports, pull requests and code reviews that we receive.
link:https://github.com/freebsd/meetings/tree/master/srcmgr[Meeting minutes] are available on GitHub.

We held a bug-busting session on 2025-05-23 with about 10 atteendees.

Members of srcmgr@ gave a link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202506?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=srcmgr+happenings.pdf[presentation] at the 2025 FreeBSD developer summit in Ottawa.

Per the discussion at the developer summit, the i386 and 32-bit powerpc targets have been disconnected from the build.

To help ensure continuity of the team, we introduced a "lurkers" program which lets src committers participate in bi-weekly srcmgr meetings, giving developers an opportunity to decide whether they are interested in officially joining srcmgr@ without taking on any specific obligations.
After soliciting interested developers, we have five lurkers who have been joining calls over the past couple of months:
- Jake Freeland <jfree@FreeBSD.org>
- Olivier Certner <olce@FreeBSD.org>
- Dag-Erling Smørgrav <des@FreeBSD.org>
- Bojan Novković <bnovkov@FreeBSD.org>
- Kyle Evans <kevans@FreeBSD.org>
Aside from participating in discussions, they have been working on src development tasks--especially in preparation for FreeBSD 15.0--and topics such as monitoring stale Phabricator reviews, performance regression tracking, and using git notes to track certain types of commit metadata.

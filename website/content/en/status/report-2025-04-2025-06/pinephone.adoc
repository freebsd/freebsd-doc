The project to port FreeBSD over to the Pinephone Pro is progressing.
The aim of this project is to step by step support components of the Pinephone Pro in FreeBSD so that the device one day might be usable as a highly mobile FreeBSD device.

In this quarter, a new development release has been made available for flashing and testing on a PinePhone Pro.
It includes a newly added touch driver, and a minimal desktop environment with an on-screen keyboard.
You can simply flash this build to an SD card and boot it up, provided you have the correct version of U-boot bootloader installed (details at the repository).
The image also contains the kernel and drivers source code, along with package:editors/vim[] editor and build tools, allowing for development of drivers on-device.

To facilitate testing and driver development, network access has been enabled via the headphone jack (using the headphone-to-USB-serial adapter).
It works by using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to access the network via your PC.
Details of setting this up are in the repository README file.

Work is now under way to develop USB and WiFi drivers.
As always, contributions in the form of testing, feedback, upstreaming, driver development, or just words of encouragement are welcome.

Linux provides a set of syscalls that allow to develop mostly
syscall-less scalable algorithms in userspace.  The mechanisms are
based on optimistic execution using CPU-local data with the assumption that
rare events like context switches or signal delivery do not occur
for the given calculation, and if they do occur, rollback and restart
is performed.  This very high-level approach is used, as I understand,
for implementation of tools like URCU, fast malloc allocators
(tcmalloc) and other userspace infrastructure projects aimed at
large partitioned machines.

For instance, sched_getcpu(2) syscall returns the CPU id of the CPU
where the current thread is currently executing.  On amd64, if
available, we use a RDTSCP or RDPID instruction to query the CPU id without
changing CPU mode, otherwise this is a light-weight syscall.  Of
course, the answer provided is obsolete the moment it is created,
even before it is returned to userspace.  But it allows seeding values
in some structures that are valid for a long time (at the
CPU speed scale) and are automatically corrected on exceptional
control flow events like context switches, and userspace can either detect
and rollback or sync and rollback with the exceptions.

There are two cornerstone syscalls that allow userspace to implement
these efficient algorithms: membarrier(2) and rseq(2).

Membarrier is a facility that helps implementing fast CPU ordering
barriers, typically used for asymmetric/biased locking.  In these lock
implementation schemes, the owner of the object often assumes that there
are contenders/parallel threads that need coordinating with.  If some
thread starts accessing the same resource, then it is its duty to
ensure correctness.  Examples of 'traps' that fast code path
utilize are reads from a dedicated page that is unmapped by contenders,
to switch the fast path to the slow one.  Or we could send a signal to all
threads that potentially have access to that object, to insert a
barrier.  Or we can use the membarrier(2) facility, which incurs
significantly less overhead than signalling all threads.

Membarrier(2) inserts a barrier, which is the typical underlying
hardware operation to ensure ordering, into the specified set of CPUs,
if these CPUs are executing the specified thread.  If these CPUs are not executing
the targeted threads, it is assumed that sequential consistency guarantees
from the context switch are enough to fulfill the requirement of
membarrier(2).  Overall, the fast path can be implemented without slow
instructions, and the slow path injects required fences into the fast path at
the cost of IPI.

The facility to detect exceptional conditions in the userspace thread
execution was developed in Linux and called rseq(2).  It is a feature
often called Restartable Atomic Sequences, which explains the acronym.
The ability to cheaply do that allows code longer than a single
instruction to execute atomically, without the need to propose and
implement unsafe operations like disabling preemption, which is not
feasible for userspace.  For instance, code might use CPU-local
resources, which otherwise does not cope well with context switches.
There cannot be an analog of critical_enter(9) in userspace.  (A
facility to cheaply block signal delivery exists in FreeBSD, see
sigfastblock(2), but correctly using it is provably too hard to
implement in general-purpose code, esp. because it requires
version-dependent coordination with rtdl and libthr.)

rseq(2) takes per-thread block of memory, where the thread writes the
current CPU id (see sched_getcpu(2)) and specifies the block of
critical code that must be unwound if an exceptional situation like a
context switch occurred while the block was executing.  The fast code
path uses per-cpu data and typically does not need any corrections,
but would a context switch occur, transfer of control to the abort
handler informs userspace about the event.  So instead of disabling
context switches, code can cheaply check for one after the calculation
and retry if needed.

An interesting rseq(2) implementation detail is that it is
impossible (and not needed) to access/update rseq structures from
kernel during the actual context switch, because we cannot access
userspace from under a spinlock.  In other words,
threads using rseq do not incur any performance cost from
system-global context switches.  Instead, if the process registered for
rseq(2), on any return to user mode we check if any exceptional
events happened while the thread was in the kernel (context switches may happen
only while the thread is in kernel mode), and if a context switch indeed
occured, we fire an ast to check whether the program counter is inside the
critical section and jump to the abort handler if it is.

The implementations of membarrier(2) and rseq(2) are clean-room: I used
Linux manual pages as the reference and public discussions of the
features for clarifying corner cases.  On Linux/glibc, there was no
stable glibc interface to the rseq facility.  One proposed integration was
committed then reverted from glibc.  It might be prudent to wait
some more for the rseq(2) interface to stabilize in glibc before providing
it in our libc or to rely on tight integration between kernel
and userspace in our base system, and use ABI tricks like symbol
versioning to evolve the interface.  There is no goal to be 100%
compatible with Linux anyway.

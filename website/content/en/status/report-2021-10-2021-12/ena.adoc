ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) is the smart NIC available in the virtualized environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The ENA driver supports multiple transmit and receive queues and can handle up to 100 Gb/s of network traffic, depending on the instance type on which it is used.

Completed since the last update:

* Add IPv6 layer 4 checksum offload support to the driver
* Add NUMA awareness to the driver when the RSS kernel option is enabled
* Rework validation of the Tx request ID
* Change lifetime of the driver's timer service
* Avoid reset triggering when the device is unresponsive

Work in progress:

* Prototype the driver port to the iflib framework
* Tests of the incoming ENA driver release (v2.5.0)

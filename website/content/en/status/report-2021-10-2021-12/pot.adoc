Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

In the last quarter, a new release link:https://github.com/pizzamig/pot/releases/tag/0.14.0[0.14.0] with a number of fixes and features like the new copy-in-flv command was made available.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

Here we again had a busy quarter. All images have been rebuilt for FreeBSD 12.3 and pot 0.13.0. +
Also the images that can be used to build a virtual data center like link:https://potluck.honeyguide.net/blog/nomad-server/[Nomad], link:https://potluck.honeyguide.net/blog/consul/[Consul] and link:https://potluck.honeyguide.net/blog/vault/[Vault] have received a lot more tender love and care and are meanwhile in pre-production use on a cluster at a fintech. +
Not all these changes have yet been committed to the github repository though, this is planned for the next quarter.
Additionally, new images like link:https://github.com/hny-gd/potluck/tree/master/openldap[multi-master OpenLDAP] have been added, too.

Potman aims to simplify building Pot images with Vagrant and VirtualBox based on the Potluck approach, e.g. as part of a DevOps workflow for software development including testing and publishing them to a repository.

Here we have not yet made a lot of headway with our plan to utilise Potman in the Potluck library build process but this is still on our TODO-list, like improving the documentation for using the Virtual DC images from the Potluck library.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project; for more information, see link:https://www.freebsd.org/internal/doceng/[FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter].

No new documentation commit bit was granted during the last quarter, and only one commit bit was safe kept.

Several tasks were completed related to the doc tree during the last quarter:

* A COPYRIGHT file was added in the root directory of the doc repository.  The license was also updated to reflect the current toolchain the project is using now.

* Cleanup of Mailman information in the doc tree.  Following mailing lists migration from Mailman to Mlmmj, very old mailing lists were removed; most of the work was made on English documents.

* Tag FreeBSD docset for 12.3-RELEASE.

* Update all ports/packages misc/freebsd-doc-*.

* Move articles/contributors/contrib-* files to the doc shared directory.

* Add option in documentation Makefile to archive/compress Documentation/HTML offline files, a necessary step before updating https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/.  This was after a discussion with clusteradm@ to update the offline assets (HTML/PDF).

* Add experimental support for EPUB output (books/articles).

* Talking with clusteradm@ to improve the performance of https://www.freebsd.org and https://docs.freebsd.org.

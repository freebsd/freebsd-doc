Here is the fourth 2025 status reports, with 28 reports.

Once more, status reports publication is almost two months late.
Since the actual schedule does not work anymore, it has been decided to change it.
Starting from next quarter, reports submission will have a unique official deadline on the 14th of the first month past the end of quarter and this deadline will be actually enforced on everyone, including committers and teams.
Then the full status report shall be pusblished as soon as assembled (most probably within the end of the month) with whatever reports have been submitted within the deadline.

Reports will not be chased anymore.
If you are late with your report, just submit a boader report next quarter.

This new strategy should help keeping fresh every news published within status reports.

Have a nice read!

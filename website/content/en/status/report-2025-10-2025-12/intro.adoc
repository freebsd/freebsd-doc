Here is the fourth 2025 status report, with 28 entries.

Since allowing late submissions leads to reports consistently coming out months late, it has been decided to change it.
Starting from next quarter, report submission will have a deadline on the 14th of the first month past the end of quarter and this deadline will be actually enforced for everyone, including committers and teams.
Then the full status report shall be published as soon as assembled (probably within the end of the month) with the entries that were submitted within the deadline.

Reports will not be chased anymore.
If you miss the deadline, just submit a broader report next quarter.

This new strategy should help each report remain fresh, relevant, and timely.

Have a nice read!

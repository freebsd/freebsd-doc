The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to advancing FreeBSD through both technical and non-technical support.
Funded entirely by donations, the Foundation supports software development, infrastructure, security, and collaboration efforts; organizes events and developer summits; provides educational resources; and represents the FreeBSD Project in legal matters.

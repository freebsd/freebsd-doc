The default JAVA_VERSION in FreeBSD ports is still OpenJDK 8.
It is time to upgrade this to a more modern version like OpenJDK 21.
We need to test and fix all ports using Java to build or run with JDK 21, or pin JAVA_VERSION in the port to the latest supported version.

The work is being tracked in PR 272855 and a Google Sheet for more details. (See the links of this report)
Already more than half of the ports that failed a test run is fixed.

If you have experience with Java and the ports system you are invited to help.
I think it is reasonable to have the ports in shape for the JAVA_VERSION=21 setting in February 2026.

* Check the last 12 ports and create a PR or commit
* Commit the PRs that are timeing out on maintainer feedback
* Ask for another exp-run
* If done, increase JAVA_VERSION

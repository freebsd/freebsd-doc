These are weekly lists of commits to the link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/[FreeBSD source tree], split into categories such as "documentation", "hardware support", "testing", and "kernel".
We also include quarterly lists of the categorized commits, for those who prefer to see three months of development at once.

Our goal is to make it easier for developers and users to keep track of changes in FreeBSD that are relevant to them, without needing to subscribe to the dev-commits-src-main mailing list and look at every single commit which lands in their mailbox.

There is a link:https://www.tarsnap.com/lists.html[freebsd-git-weekly@tarsnap.com] mailing list that provides announcements about each report.

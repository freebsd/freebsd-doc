In recent reports, the new Accessibility Handbook was announced and its reviews were published.
The handbook aims to document the assistive technologies available in FreeBSD, covering both the base system and the Ports Collection.

During this quarter:

* The book was presented at the FreeBSD Developer Summit Zagreb 2025, with slides available link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rnw5fU8KyUCGNqR6gkM5IBdyx8cVVdqigCGmrrd--a4[here].
* The book was published and is now available on the FreeBSD website under link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/[Documentation] > link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/[Books] > link:https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/accessibility/[Accessibility Handbook].

At present, the handbook describes assistive technologies related to visual disabilities.
It is part of the Vision Accessibility project sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.
The handbook is structured into two parts and six chapters:

. Help -- Covers how to request assistance effectively through appropriate FreeBSD communication channels.
. Virtual Terminal -- Documents vision-related accessibility features of the FreeBSD virtual console (man:vt[4]).
. Colors -- Explains how to configure color schemes, including high-contrast themes and adjusting screen colors for ambient lighting.
. Low Vision -- Outlines accessibility tools in graphical desktop environments for users with low vision, such as screen magnifiers, readable fonts, and scaling.
. Blindness -- Describes assistive technologies for blind users, focusing primarily on screen readers and compatible tools.
. Development -- Provides resources for developers to make their software accessible, test accessibility, and improve support for users with visual impairments.

The handbook deliberately avoids images and minimizes non-plain-text elements to enhance compatibility with assistive technologies.
Tips and new ideas are welcome.
If possible, send reports to the FreeBSD Accessibility mailing list, to share and to track discussions in a public place.

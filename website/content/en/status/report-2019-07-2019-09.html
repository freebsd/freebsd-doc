          <div id="contentwrap"><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Here is the third quarterly status report for 2019.</p><p>This quarter the reports team has been more active than usual thanks
to a better organization: calls for reports and reminders have been
sent regularly, reports have been reviewed and merged quickly (I would
like to thank debdrup@ in particular for his reviewing work).</p><p>Efficiency could still be improved with the help of our community.
In particular, the quarterly team has found that many reports have
arrived in the last days before the deadline or even after. I would
like to invite the community to follow the guidelines below that
can help us sending out the reports sooner.</p><p><ul>
<li>Send a first draft of your report when you receive the first call
for reports (1 month before the deadline).</li>
<li>Update your report, if needed, when you receive reminders: you will
normaly receive two (2 weeks and 1 week before the deadline).</li>
<li>If after the deadline you still have some more updates ask the team
(either on IRC via #freebsd-wiki or send an email at monthly@) to
wait for you if you feel that they are urgent, otherwise start
putting them in a draft for the next quarter.</li></ul></p><p>Starting from next quarter, all quarterly status reports will be
prepared the last month of the quarter itself, instead of the first
month after the quarter's end. This means that deadlines for

      <p>The FreeBSD CI team maintains continuous integration
	system and related tasks
	for the FreeBSD project. The CI system regularly checks
	the committed changes
	can be successfully built, then performs various tests and
	analysis of the
	results. The results from build jobs are archived in an
	artifact server, for
	the further testing and debugging needs. The CI team
	members examine the
	failing builds and unstable tests, and work with the
	experts in that area to
	fix the code or adjust test infrastructure. The details
	are of these efforts
	are available in the weekly CI reports.</p>

	Contact: Deb Goodkin &lt;<a href="mailto:deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org">deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org</a>&gt;
	</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
	organization dedicated to
	supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community
	worldwide.
	Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and
	is used to fund
	and manage software development projects, conferences and
	developer summits,
	and provide travel grants to FreeBSD contributors. The
	Foundation purchases
	and supports hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD
	infrastructure and
	provides resources to improve security and quality
	assurance efforts;
	publishes marketing material to promote, educate, and
	advocate for the
	FreeBSD Project; facilitates collaboration between
	commercial vendors and
	FreeBSD developers; and finally, represents the FreeBSD
	Project in executing
	contracts, license agreements, and other legal
	arrangements that require a
	recognized legal entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD
	last quarter:</p>

      <p>Partnerships and Commercial User Support
	We help facilitate collaboration between commercial users
	and FreeBSD
	developers. We also meet with companies to discuss their
	needs and bring
	that information back to the Project. In Q3, Ed Maste and
	Deb Goodkin met
	with a few commercial users in the US. It is not only
	beneficial for the
	above, but it also helps us understand some of the
	applications where
	FreeBSD is used. We were also able to meet with a good
	number of commercial
	users at vBSDCon and EuroBSDCon. These venues provide an
	excellent
	opportunity to meet with commercial and individual users
	and contributors
	to FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Fundraising Efforts
	Our work is 100% funded by your donations. We are
	continuing to work hard
	to get more commercial users to give back to help us
	continue our work
	supporting FreeBSD. More importantly, we'd like to thank
	our individual
	donors for making $10-$1,000 donations last quarter, for
	more than $16,000!</p>

      <p>Please consider
	<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/" shape="rect">making
	a donation</a> to help us
	continue and increase our support for FreeBSD!</p>

      <p>We also have the Partnership Program, to provide more
	benefits for our
	larger commercial donors. Find out more information at
	<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/" shape="rect">www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/</a>
	and share with your companies.</p>

      <p>OS Improvements</p>
      <p>The Foundation supports software development projects to
	improve the FreeBSD
	operating system through our full time technical staff,
	contractors, and
	project grant recipients. They maintain and improve
	critical kernel
	subsystems, add new features and functionality, and fix
	problems.</p>

      <p>Over the last quarter there were 345 commits to the
	FreeBSD base system
	repository sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation - this
	represents about
	one fifth of all commits during this period. Many of these
	projects have
	their own entries in this quarterly report (and are not
	repeated here).</p>

      <p>Foundation staff member Konstantin Belousov committed many
	improvements to
	multiple kernel subsystems, as well as low-level 32-bit
	and 64-bit x86
	infrastructure. These included fixes for robust mutexes,
	unionfs, the
	out of memory (OOM) handler, and per-cpu allocators.</p>

      <p>Additional work included fixes for security issues and
	introduction and
	maintenance of vulnerability mitigations, and improving
	POSIX conformance.</p>

      <p>Ed Maste committed a number of minor security bug fixes
	and improvements,
	as well as the first iteration of a tool for editing the
	mitigation control
	ELF note. Additional work included effort on build
	infrastructure and the
	tool chain.</p>

      <p>Clang's integrated assembler (IAS) is now used more
	widely, as part of the
	path to retiring the assembler from GNU binutils 2.17.50.
	The readelf tool
	now decodes some additional ELF note information.</p>

      <p>Ed also enabled the Linuxulator (Linux binary support
	layer) on arm64, and
	added a trivial implementation of the renameat2 system
	call (handling common
	options).</p>

      <p>Mark Johnston added Capsicum support to a number of ELF
	Tool Chain utilities,
	and committed a number of other Capsicum kernel and
	userland fixes.</p>

      <p>Mark worked on a number of changes related to security
	improvements, including
	integration and support of the Syzkaller automated system
	call fuzzer, and
	fixing issues identified by Syzkaller. Other changes
	included addressing
	failures caused by refcount wraparound, improvements to
	the <tt>prot_max</tt> memory
	protection. Other work included NUMA, locking, kernel
	debugging, RISC-V and
	arm64 kernel improvements.</p>

      <p>Edward Napierala continued working on Linuxulator
	improvements over the
	quarter. The primary focus continued to be tool
	improvements - strace is now
	more usable for diagnosing issues with Linux binaries
	running under the
	Linuxulator. That said, as with previous work a number of
	issues have been
	fixed along the way. These are generally minor issues with
	a large impact -
	for example, every binary linked against up-to-date glibc
	previously
	segfaulted on startup. This is now fixed.</p>

      <p>Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance
	The Foundation provides a full-time staff member who is
	working on improving
	our automated testing, continuous integration, and overall
	quality assurance
	efforts.</p>

      <p>During the third quarter of 2019, Foundation staff
	continued to improve the
	project's CI infrastructure, worked with contributors to
	fix the failing build
	and test cases, and worked with other teams in the Project
	for their testing
	needs. We added several new CI jobs and worked on getting
	the hardware
	regression testing lab ready.</p>

      <p>Li-Wen Hsu gave presentations "Testing/CI status update"
	and "How to work with
	the FreeBSD CI system" at the
	<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/201909" shape="rect">201909
	DevSummit</a>.
	Slides are available at the DevSummit page.</p>

      <p>We continue publishing the CI weekly report on the
	<a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-testing" shape="rect">freebsd-testing@</a>.
	mailing list, and an <a href="https://hackmd.io/@freebsd-ci" shape="rect">archive</a>
	is available.</p>

      <p>See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for completed
	work items and
	detailed information.</p>

      <p>Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure
	The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve
	the FreeBSD
	infrastructure. Last quarter, we continued supporting
	FreeBSD hardware
	located around the world.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD Advocacy and Education
	A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating
	for the Project.
	This includes promoting work being done by others with
	FreeBSD; producing
	advocacy literature to teach people about FreeBSD and help
	make the path to
	starting using FreeBSD or contributing to the Project
	easier; and attending
	and getting other FreeBSD contributors to volunteer to run
	FreeBSD events,
	staff FreeBSD tables, and give FreeBSD presentations.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events,
	and summits around
	the globe. These events can be BSD-related, open source,
	or technology events
	geared towards underrepresented groups. We support the
	FreeBSD-focused events
	to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to work
	together on projects,
	and to facilitate collaboration between developers and
	commercial users.
	This all helps provide a healthy ecosystem. We support the
	non-FreeBSD events
	to promote and raise awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the
	use of FreeBSD in
	different applications, and to recruit more contributors
	to the Project.</p>

      <p>Check out some of the advocacy and education work we did

	depend on xorg ports have
	been updated.
	We have switched <tt>USE_XORG</tt> and <tt>XORG_CAT</tt>
	to use the <tt>USES</tt> framework, instead
	of the old way of including <tt>bsd.xorg.mk</tt> from
	<tt>bsd.port.mk</tt>.
	This infrastructure work has been fairly substantial, and
	new ports depending on
	xorg ports should add <tt>USES=xorg</tt> to their
	makefiles.
	As part of this <tt>bsd.xorg.mk</tt> was split up, and the
	<tt>XORG_CAT</tt> part was split
	out to <tt>USES=xorg-cat</tt>.
	This is used for the xorg ports themselves, and sets up a
	common environment for
	building all xorg ports.
	In addition, framework for pulling xorg ports directly
	from freedesktop.org
	gitlab was added, which will make improve development and
	testing, since it
	makes it possible to create ports of unreleased versions.
	Further improvements in this area includes framework for
	using meson instead of
	autotools for building xorg ports.
	This is still a work in progress.</p>

      <p>We have also worked to clean up and deprecate several old
	xorg ports and
	libraries.
	Some of these ports have already been removed, and some
	are still waiting on
	removal after a sufficient deprecation period.
	Most notably amongst the deprecations are
	<tt>x11/libXp</tt>, which required to fix
	several dependencies.
	Several other old libraries have also been deprecated,
	such as <tt>x11/Xxf86misc</tt>,
	<tt>x11-fonts/libXfontcache</tt> and
	<tt>graphics/libGLw</tt>.
	Some applications and drivers have also been deprecated
	during the period.
	With the remaining removals in this area, we should be up
	to speed with
	deprecations upstream.
	We are currently investigating if there are new software
	added upstream that we
	need to port to FreeBSD.</p>

	meetings.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for
	setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project
	releases
	of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>During the third quarter of 2019, the FreeBSD Release
	Engineering team
	finished the 11.3-RELEASE cycle, with the final release
	build started on
	July 5th and the official announcement sent on July 9th.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE is the fourth release from the
	<i>stable/11</i> branch,
	building on the stability and reliability of 11.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team also started work on
	the upcoming
	12.1-RELEASE, which started September 6th. This release
	cycle is the
	first "freeze-less" release from the Subversion
	repository, and the test bed
	for eliminating the requirement of a hard code freeze on
	development branches.
	Commits to the <i>releng/12.1</i> branch still
	require explicit approval from
	the Release Engineering Team, however.</p>

      <p>At present, there have been three BETA builds, and so far,
	two RC builds, with
	the final 12.1-RELEASE build scheduled for November 4th.</p>

      <p>Additionally throughout the quarter, several development
	snapshots builds
	were released for the <i>head</i> and
	<i>stable/11</i> branches; snapshots for
	<i>stable/12</i> were released as well although
	not during the 12.1-RELEASE cycle.</p>

      <p>Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications,
	LLC (Netgate)
	and the FreeBSD Foundation.</p>

      <p>In order to streamline the process of creating install or
	virtual
	machine system images we needed FAT filesystem support in
	makefs(8).
	Makefs was originally developed in NetBSD, and FAT support
	was added
	there not much later, but after the tool was ported to
	FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Siva Mahadevan, one of the FreeBSD Foundation's interns
	from the
	University of Waterloo, worked on porting FAT support from
	NetBSD.
	I <a href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/D16438" shape="rect">rebased and

	build FAT
	filesystem images without using md(4) and without

      <p>FUSE (File system in USErspace) allows a userspace program
	to
	implement a file system. It is widely used to support
	out-of-tree file
	systems like NTFS, as well as for exotic pseudo file
	systems like
	sshfs. FreeBSD's fuse driver was added as a GSoC project
	in 2012.
	Since that time, it has been largely neglected. The FUSE
	software is

	and out-of-date. Our implementation is about 11 years
	behind.</p>

      <p>I completed this work during Q3. I fixed a few
	newly-introduced bugs, fixed a
	long-standing sendfile bug that affects FUSE

	([236466](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=236466))
	and merged
	everything to head and stable/12. Then I fixed the
	resulting Coverity CIDs.
	There have been no new FUSE-related bug reports, so I can
	only assume that
	everything is working great. Report any problems to
	asomers@FreeBSD.org.</p>

      <p><b>About -</b> With the introduction of VNET(9)
	in FreeBSD, Jails are free to
	set their IP addresses. However, this privilege may need
	to be limited by
	the host as per its need for multiple security reasons.
	This project uses mac(9) for an access control framework
	to impose
	restrictions on FreeBSD jails according to rules defined
	by the root of the
	host using sysctl(8). It involves the development of a
	dynamically loadable
	kernel module (mac_ipacl) based on The TrustedBSD MAC
	Framework to
	implement a security policy for configuring the network
	stack.
	This project allows the root of the host to define the
	policy rules to
	limit the root of a jail to a set of IP (v4 or v6)
	addresses and/or subnets
	for a set of interfaces.</p>

      <p>Features this new MAC policy module are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The host can define one or more lists of IP
	addresses/subnets
      	for the jail to choose from.</li>

	<li>The host can restrict the jail from setting certain IP
	addresses or
      	prefixes (subnets).</li>

	<li>The host can restrict this privilege to a few network
	interfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	<b>Implementation -</b> The mac_ipacl module is
	a loadable kernel module. It
	implements mac checks in netinet/in.c and netinet6/in6.c
	to check the IP
	addresses requested by jail. The idea to implement these
	checks at these
	places comes from the fact that SIOCAIFADDR (for IPv4) and
	SIOCAIFADDR_IN6 (for IPv6) ioctl handlers are defined for
	adding the IP
	addresses to an interface. This is used by ifconfig (in
	userspace) for
	setting the IP address. The MAC Framework acts as
	multiplexer between the
	netinet and the module. The requested IP and the
	credentials are checked
	with the rules in mac_ipacl and output is returned
	accordingly to netinet.
	The module can be tuned with various sysctl and similarly,
	policy rules are
	also be defined with sysctl.</p>

      <p><b>TestSuite -</b> Test scripts integrated with
	kyua and ATF are included with
	the module.</p>

      <p><b>Using the module -</b> I have written a man
	page for the module. Please
	refer to the mac_ipacl(4) for using the new MAC module and
	various examples.</p>

      <p><b>Final Deliverables -</b></p>

      <ul>
	<li>A loadable kernel module - <a href="https://github.com/shivankgarg98/freebsd/tree/shivank_MACPolicyIPAddressJail/sys/security/mac_ipacl" shape="rect">mac_ipacl

	</p>
      <p>RFC-7862 describes a new minor revision to the NFS Version
	4 protocol.
	This project implements this new minor revision.</p>

      <p>The NFS Version 4 Minor Version 2 protocol adds several
	optional
	features to NFS, such as support for SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE,
	file
	copying done on the server that avoids data transfer over
	the wire
	and support for posix_fallocate(), posix_fadvise().
	Hopefully these features can improve performance for
	certain applications.</p>

      <p>The implementation is now nearing completion and recent
	work has been
	mostly testing. A cycle of interoperability testing with
	Linux has
	just been completed. The main area that still needs
	testing is use
	of the pNFS server with NFSv4.2 and that should start
	soon.
	Once testing of pNFS is completed, I believe the code is
	ready to
	be incorporated into FreeBSD head/current.</p>

      <p>Testing by others would be appreciated. The modified
	kernel can be
	found at https://svn.freebsd.org/base/projects/nfsv42/sys
	and should
	run with a recent FreeBSD head/current system. Client
	mounts need the
	"minorversion=2" mount option to enable this protocol.</p>

      <p>See the syzkaller entry in the 2019q1 quarterly report for
	an
	introduction to syzkaller.</p>

      <p>Work has continued on fixing bugs uncovered by syzkaller.
	Over a dozen
	kernel bugs fixed in the past three months have been
	directly attributed
	to syzkaller, and a number of syzkaller reproducers have
	been
	incorporated into our test suite.</p>

      <p>backtrace.io, via Samy, has graciously provided a large
	server for
	running a dedicated syzkaller instance to fuzz FreeBSD
	under bhyve.
	Though syzbot, the public syzkaller instance run by
	Google, already
	fuzzes FreeBSD, it has proven fruitful to run multiple
	syzkaller
	instances: different instances find different bugs, and
	syzkaller.backtrace.io allows us to experiment with
	FreeBSD-specific
	extensions. In particular, this instance currently uploads
	data about
	each crash to backtrace.io, making it much easier to
	triage and analyze
	crashes. We plan to make this service generally available
	to FreeBSD
	developers in the near future.</p>

      <p>Going forward we will continue to extend syzkaller
	coverage and make it
	simpler for users and developers to run private instances,
	and
	optionally collect kernel crash information for debugging
	or for
	submission.</p>

      <p>The Compare-And-Swap (CAS) is one of the fundamental
	building blocks
	for hardware-assisted atomic read/modify/write operations.
	Some
	architectures support it directly, for instance x86 and
	sparc. Others
	provide different building blocks, usually the pair of
	Load
	Linked/Store Conditional instructions (ll/sc) which can be
	used to construct
	CAS or other atomic operations like Fetch-And-Add or any
	atomic
	arithmetic ops using plain arithmetic instructions. An
	example is the
	LDXR/STXR pair on AArch64.</p>

      <p>The ll/sc operation is performed by first using the load
	linked
	instruction to load a value from memory and simultaneously
	mark the
	cache line for exclusive access. The value is then updated
	by the
	store conditional instruction, but only if there were not
	any writes to
	the marked cache line. Any write by another CPU makes the
	store
	instruction fail. So typically atomic primitives on ll/sc
	architectures retry the whole operation if only store
	failed, because
	it just means that this CPU either lost a race, or even
	the failure
	was spurious. This is so called strong version of CAS and
	atomics.
	If primitive returns failure instead, the CAS variant is
	called weak
	by C standard.</p>

      <p>For the FreeBSD threading library lock implementation,
	when the fast path
	mode in userspace was not possible, the kernel often needs
	to do a CAS
	operation on user memory location. In addition to all
	guarantees of
	normal CAS, it also must ensure the safety and tolerance
	to paging.
	In FreeBSD, the casueword32(9) primitive provides CAS on
	usermode
	32bit words for kernel. Casueword32(9) was implemented as
	strong CAS,
	similarly to the mode of operation of hardware CAS
	instructions on
	x86.</p>

      <p>Using the strong implementation for casueword may be
	dangerous,
	since the same address is potentially accessible to other,
	potentially
	malicious, threads in the same or other processes. If
	such a thread constantly dirties the cache line used by a
	ll/sc loop, it
	could practically force the kernel-mode thread to remain
	stuck in the loop
	forever. Since the loop is tight, and it does not check
	for signals,
	the thread cannot be stopped or killed.</p>

      <p>The solution is to make the casueword implementation weak,
	which means that
	the interface of the primitive must be changed to allow
	notifying the
	caller about spurious failures. Also, it is now the
	caller's responsibility
	to retry as appropriate.</p>

      <p>The change to casueword was made for all architectures.
	Even on x86,
	the PSL.ZF value after the CMPXCHG instruction was
	returned directly
	for the new casueword. All two dozens uses of the
	primitive, all
	located in <i>kern_umtx.c</i>, were inspected
	and retry added as needed.</p>

      <p>As a somewhat related note, in-kernel
	<tt>atomic_cmpset(9)</tt> operations are
	strong, while <tt>atomic_fcmpset(9)</tt> should be weak,
	unless broken by
	a specific architecture. The general attitude seems to be
	that retry is the
	duty of the primitive's caller.</p>

	</p>
      <p>Modern CPU architectures have the ability to flag memory
	mappings as
	"no-execute" (NX), which prevents that memory from being
	executed by a
	processor. NX mappings are an important security
	mitigation since they help
	segregate code and data, blocking unintentional execution
	of memory whose
	contents is controlled by an attacker. W^X (write XOR
	execute) is a security
	policy which disallows the creation of mappings that are
	simultaneously
	writeable and executable. Under this policy, memory whose
	contents can be
	modified must be mapped with the NX flag. This policy
	makes it harder to exploit
	bugs that permit an attacker to arbitrarily overwrite
	data.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD has long made use of the NX flag for userspace
	mappings whenever
	possible, but only in the past several years has it been
	applied to kernel
	mappings. A recent project has sought to implement a
	W^X-by-default policy for
	the amd64 kernel by completing an audit of the remaining
	executable mappings in
	the kernel, and making modifications to either apply the
	NX bit to those
	mappings or to make them read-only. This work has landed
	in HEAD and will be
	available in FreeBSD 13.0 and 12.2. Similar work for other
	CPU architectures is
	also planned.</p>

      <p>To help audit kernel mapping protections, the
	vm.pmap.kernel_maps sysctl was
	added; it dumps a snapshot of the kernel's page table
	entries and their
	attributes. This way, mappings violating the W^X policy
	can easily be
	discovered and investigated, and the sysctl provides
	information useful to
	anyone interested in kernel memory layout.</p>

      <p>With a few rare exceptions, the only kernel mappings which
	require execute
	permission are those of the kernel executable itself, and
	loadable kernel
	modules. A number of other regions of memory were
	unnecessarily being mapped
	without NX, and these were identified and corrected first.
	To address the
	kernel code mappings, the amd64 kernel linker script was
	modified to pad the
	.text segment to a 2MB boundary. To improve performance,
	the kernel creates
	superpage mappings of its .text segment, but this means
	that any data cohabiting
	the final 2MB .text mapping is mapped with execute
	permissions. The padding
	allows executable code to be segregated from data which
	follows in the kernel
	image, avoiding this problem and maintaining the superpage
	optimization at the
	expense of some wasted RAM.</p>

      <p>Enforcing W^X turned out to be somewhat trickier. Unlike
	other CPU
	architectures supported by FreeBSD, amd64 kernel modules
	are linked as
	relocatable object files, i.e., .o files. (On other
	architectures, they are
	dynamically shared objects (DSOs, or .so files), as one
	might naively expect.)
	The use of .o files means that amd64 kernel modules
	contain more efficient code
	than they would if linked as DSOs, since DSOs inherently
	make use of certain
	types of indirection which allow shared libraries to be
	loaded at arbitrary
	addresses, and this indirection is useless in the kernel.
	As part of this
	project an attempt was made to switch amd64 to using DSOs
	as well, since the
	cost of this indirection can largely be mitigated with
	modern toolchains, but it
	was found that the use of DSOs would also force a change
	to the code model used
	when compiling amd64 kernel code, resulting in a further
	performance penalty.</p>

      <p>The main obstacle with the use of .o files is that
	sections are not page-aligned
	by default; the segregation of sections with differing
	mapping protection
	requirements is done by the static linker when linking a
	DSO or executable file.
	Since mapping protections are applied at the granularity
	of the page size (4KB
	on amd64), the overlap of sections within a page causes
	problems since, for
	example, the end of the read-only .text section may
	overlap with the beginning
	of the read-write .data section. One possible solution is
	to perform any
	required section reordering and padding at kernel module
	load time, but this
	approach breaks debugging tools such as dtrace(1) and kgdb
	which assume that the
	kernel linker does not modify the layout of loadable
	modules. As a result, an
	amd64 kernel module linker script is now used to insert
	padding for specific
	sections. Finally, the kernel linker was modified to
	restrict mapping
	protections based on section flags.</p>

      <p>As a result of all of this, amd64 kernels now boot without
	any writeable,
	executable mappings. Though some of the work was
	architecture-specific, much of
	it can and will be leveraged to provide the same policy
	for our other supported
	architectures.</p>

	</p>
      <p>Unix-like systems provide the <tt>mmap(2)</tt> system call
	to allocate memory or
	map files or devices into memory with specified access
	protection, and the
	<tt>mprotect(2)</tt> system call to change protections on
	mapped memory. Protection
	flags specify whether the memory may be read, written,
	and/or executed
	(<tt>PROT_READ</tt>, <tt>PROT_WRITE</tt>, <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt>
	respectively). Traditionally,
	<tt>mprotect(2)</tt> can be used to set any desired
	protections (except that a
	shared mapping of a file opened read-only cannot have
	<tt>PROT_WRITE</tt> set).</p>

      <p>A new macro <tt>PROT_MAX()</tt> adds a facility for
	specifying the maximum possible
	protection flags for <tt>mmap(2)</tt> and
	<tt>mprotect(2)</tt> calls. The program can then
	specify whether a mapping may be changed in the future to
	allow a given access
	protection. For example, a memory mapping can be set such
	that it can have
	read and write protections set, but may never be made
	executable.</p>

      <p>Maximum protection values are provided to the
	<tt>PROT_MAX()</tt> macro, and are
	OR'd with regular protection values.</p>

      <p>This change allows (e.g.) a region that must be writable
	during run-time
	linking or JIT code generation to be made permanently
	read+execute after
	writes are complete. This complements Write-XOR-Execute
	(W^X) protections
	available on other operating systems, allowing more
	precise control by the
	programmer.</p>

      <p>For example, to request memory that cannot be made
	executable:
	<ttt>
	mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE |
	PROT_MAX(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE),
	MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
	</ttt></p>

      <p>and to request memory that may have execute permission
	enabled later on, but
	is not currently executable:</p>

      <p><ttt>
	mmap(NULL, size,
	PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_MAX(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE |
	PROT_EXECUTE),
	MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
	</ttt></p>

      <p>This change alters mprotect argument checking and returns
	an error when
	unhandled protection flags are set. This differs from
	POSIX (in that POSIX
	only specifies an error if a valid permission can not be
	set), but is the
	documented behavior on Linux and more closely matches
	historical mmap behavior.</p>

      <p>In addition to explicit setting of the maximum
	permissions, an experimental
	sysctl <tt>vm.imply_prot_max</tt> causes mmap to assume
	that the initial permissions
	requested should be the maximum when the sysctl is set to
	1. This behavior is
	known to break code that uses <tt>PROT_NONE</tt>
	reservations before mapping contents
	into part of the reservation. A later version of this work
	is expected to
	provide per-binary and per-process opt-in/out options and
	this sysctl may be
	removed in its current form. As such it is undocumented.</p>

      <p>While these flags are non-portable, they can be used in
	portable code with
	simple ifdefs to expand <tt>PROT_MAX()</tt> to 0.</p>

	Contact: Konstantin Belousov &lt;<a href="mailto:kib@FreeBSD.org">kib@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p>
      <p>After the ASLR so useful addition, next in the series of
	the
	buzzword-compliant checkboxes is the stack addresses
	randomization.</p>

      <p>The main userspace thread stack on FreeBSD is
	traditionally allocated
	from the top of the user address space and grows down.
	Besides the
	initial pointer for the stack on userspace entry, this
	area also
	contains structures for program arguments and environment
	(so called
	strings), and aux vector data for ELF images.</p>

      <p>Considering the goal of randomizing the addresses of
	strings and main
	thread initial frame, moving the main stack area in the
	address space
	is not feasible. It would cause significant ABI breakage,
	invalidates
	the knowledge already coded into many introspection tools,
	and causes
	unneeded additional fragmentation of the user address
	space.</p>

      <p>Instead a typical approach of adding a gap of randomized
	size between
	top of stack and a place for strings was used. It is done
	in a way
	which preserves the stack alignment requirement. Stack gap
	is only
	enabled if ASLR is enabled (not default) and stack gap
	itself is
	enabled (default if ASLR is enabled). Stack gap is
	specified in
	percentage of the total stack size that can be used for
	maximum gap.</p>

      <p>The main drawback of the gap approach was shortly
	identified. Since
	gap is cut from the normal stack area, attempts of the
	programs to
	reduce stack size using rlimit(RLIMIT_STACK) could cut the
	active stack
	region if new limit happens to be smaller than the gap.
	E.g. on amd64
	with its default 512M main thread stack, even one percent
	of the max
	gap gives approximately 5M of unused stack, that can blow
	up the limit
	of several KBs.</p>

      <p>Typical reason for using rlimit(2) this way is for
	programs that wire
	all of its address space with mlockall(2), trying to
	reduce potential
	wired stack size to avoid exceeding RLIMIT_MEMLOCK.</p>

      <p>First victim of that issue was ntpd, which resets the
	stack limit
	after start for a really small value. Currently the wiring
	was removed
	from ntpd, because apparently it does not make the
	timekeeping better
	by any means, contrary to popular belief.</p>

      <p>My opinion is that the problem is more in the user
	interface area than
	in the gap approach itself. We should make it easy to
	specify small
	gap sizes, which cannot be done with integral percentage
	interface.
	So far I did not formulated a way to do this which I would
	like, and
	since nobody looked for a good solution because after ntpd
	was fixed,
	the severity of the issue seems very low.</p>

	Contact: Konstantin Belousov &lt;<a href="mailto:kib@FreeBSD.org">kib@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p>
      <p>By necessity, handling of page faults is separated into
	two pieces. The
	first is the architecture-dependent low-level machine
	exception handler,
	and the second is the architecture-independent
	<tt>vm_fault()</tt> function in
	<i>sys/vm/vm_fault.c</i>.</p>

      <p>Machine-dependent code for page faults typically consists
	of three
	components: a trampoline written in assembly which creates
	the C execution
	environment and gathers hardware-supplied data about page
	fault reason, a
	<tt>trap()</tt> function which is common C-level entry
	point to dispatch all
	exceptions processing, and the <tt>trap_pfault()</tt> C
	function to specifically
	handle page faults. <tt>trap_pfault()</tt> calls
	<tt>vm_fault()</tt> when help from VM is
	needed to resolve the situation.</p>

      <p>If the fault was handled either by
	<tt>trap()</tt>/<tt>trap_pfault()</tt> or
	<tt>vm_fault()</tt>,
	the faulting instruction is restarted. If fault cannot be
	handled for
	any reason, the next action depends on the mode in which
	the fault occurred.
	If it was in kernel, and the kernel installed a helper,
	then the helper is
	called instead of returning to the faulting instruction.
	Otherwise,
	a kernel-mode page fault causes a panic.</p>

      <p>If the unhandled fault occurred in usermode, then all
	Unixes send a
	signal to the thread whose execution caused the exception.
	POSIX (or
	Single Unix Specification) lists several cases where a
	signal should be
	sent, and specifies the signal number and <tt>si_code</tt>
	from siginfo that
	must be supplied with the signal.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, FreeBSD was rather non-compliant in this
	regard. A long
	time ago, to improve compliance, we changed the signal
	sent on access
	to a page with permissions incompatible with the access
	mode.
	That caused multiple problems with garbage collection
	(GC)-based runtimes
	which incorporated knowledge of the FreeBSD quirks, so the
	<tt>machdep.prot_fault_translation</tt> sysctl knob was
	added. More cases of
	incompatibility were identified recently.</p>

      <p>Part of the problem is that code to calculate the signal
	and <tt>si_code</tt> from
	the Mach error returned by <tt>vm_fault()</tt> was located
	in <tt>trap_pfault()</tt>. In
	other words, each architecture did that on its own, with a
	specific set
	of bugs and non-compliance. Sometimes code even
	mis-interpreted returned
	Mach errors as <tt>errno</tt>.</p>

      <p>A new helper function <tt>vm_fault_trap()</tt> was added,
	that does several
	things for trap handlers: it creates ktrace points for
	faults, calls
	<tt>vm_fault()</tt>, and then interprets the result in
	terms of the user-visible
	error condition, returning precalculated signal number and
	<tt>si_code</tt> to
	the caller. Now <tt>trap_pfault()</tt> only needs to
	provide signal numbers
	for truly machine-dependent errors. For amd64, an example
	of such a
	case is a protection key violation.</p>

      <p>Besides compliance and bug fixes, we also provided some
	refinements to
	userspace about the reason of the delivered signal. For
	instance, on
	SIGBUS caused by copy-on-write failure due to exceeding
	swap
	reservation limit, we provide specific <tt>si_code</tt>
	<tt>BUS_OOMERR</tt>.</p>

      <p>In September 2019, Arm announced Morello, an experimental
	multicore superscalar
	ARMv8-A CPU, SoC, and prototype board extended to
	implement the CHERI
	protection model. Morello will become available in 2021.

      <p>We have updated CheriBSD, a CHERI-adapted version of
	FreeBSD originally
	targeted at the MIPS-based SRI/Cambridge CHERI processor
	prototype, to support
	the current draft architecture. This includes full

	userspace binaries.</p>

      <p>We will continue to update CheriBSD/Morello as the ISA is
	finalised. Will also
	closely track the public CheriBSD/MIPS trunk, picking up
	new software features
	utilizing CHERI as they mature, as well as to pick up
	changes from the baseline
	FreeBSD development trunk.</p>

      <p>We currently anticipate releasing CheriBSD/Morello as open

      <p>The FreeBSD/powerpc project continues to make great
	strides. However,
	as we discovered at BSDCan 2019, we have not done a great
	job of letting
	people know.</p>

      <p>Key points:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>powerpc64 src on recent hardware has been
	production-quality for over
	a year now.</li>
	<li>powerpc64 ports has been developer-quality for over 18
	months now.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The main targeted platforms:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>powerpc64 on IBM POWER8 and POWER9 chips (the most recent
	available).
	This is the primary focus going forward. FreeBSD 12 is
	required;
	FreeBSD 13 is recommended.</li>
	<li>powerpc64 on older Apple Power Macs, on a continuing but
	secondary
	basis. Any FreeBSD version should work.</li>
	<li>powerpc64 on x5000. However, this is still developer-only
	quality.
	FreeBSD 13 is recommended.</li>
	<li>powerpcspe on Amiga A1222. However, this is still
	developer-only quality.
	FreeBSD 13 is recommended.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The software status:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>powerpc*/12 and earlier still remain on the antiquated
	gcc4.2.1 in
	base.</li>
	<li>powerpc*/13 will soon be switched to llvm90 in base. A
	great deal
	of work has been undertaken to ensure as few regressions
	as possible.
	Once that switch has occurred (see llvm-elfv2 link above),
	powerpc*/13
	support on gcc4.2.1 will no longer be a priority.</li>
	<li>FreeBSD.org package sets are available for powerpc64/12
	(quarterly)
	and powerpc64/13 (default) through the usual method.</li>
	<li>Firefox works on powerpc64 using experimental (not-yet
	committed) patches,</li>
	<li>As of the most recent package build on powerpc64/13 (still
	gcc4.2.1),
	the following statistics apply:
	<table class="tblbasic">
	<tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Queued </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Built </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Failed </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Skipped </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Ignored </th></tr>

      <p>gets is an obsolete C library routine for reading a string
	from standard
	input. It was removed from the C standard as of C11
	because there was no
	way to use it safely. Prompted by a comment during Paul
	Vixie's talk at
	vBSDCon 2017 I started investigating what it would take to
	remove gets
	from libc.</p>

      <p><a href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/D12298" shape="rect">The patch</a>
	was posted to Phabricator
	and refined several times, and the portmgr team performed
	several
	<a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/222796" shape="rect">exp-runs</a> to
	identify ports broken by
	the removal. Symbol versioning is used to preserve binary

      <p>FreshPorts consolidates commits into an easy-to-follow
	format so you can track changes to your favorite ports.
	It also processes src, doc, and www commit. FreshPorts
	parses
	incoming emails and refreshes the database with what it
	finds.</p>

      <p>In early September I started looking at how FreshPorts
	could use a git repository for processing commits. The
	result was <a href="https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/02/git-and-freshports/" shape="rect">an
	approach</a> for identifying new commits and
	for iterating through them.</p>

      <p>The next idea was <a href="https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/18/moving-towards-commit-hooks/" shape="rect">commit
	hooks</a> but the most interesting
	bit of that exercise was commit iteration.</p>

      <p>At the EuroBSDCon 2019 FreeBSD Developer summit, I wrote
	up a small requirements section and then received great
	help from two sources:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Jan-Piet MENS recommended a <a href="https://www.freshports.org/devel/py-gitpython/" shape="rect">Python
	library</a> and
	it turned out to be great</li>
	<li>Sergey Kozlov wrote Python code to create xml using
	that Python library</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	On the trip home, I was able to get the code to parse
	a git commit into XML and loaded into a FreshPorts
	database.</p>

      <p>Returning home from the conference, I created a new
	FreshPorts instance for processing git based on the above.
	The website has needed no changes related to git.</p>

      <p>The remaining tasks:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>automate the script (git pull, etc)</li>

	<li>detect new commits (for later iteration)</li>

	<li>design a light-weight git hook</li>

      <p>Over the last few quarters there has been considerable
	work in improving
	support for Java 11 and higher, with some work being
	backported to Java 8.</p>

      <p>Starting with the initial release in March on amd64, over
	the
	intervening months FreeBSD support was added for features
	such as:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Java Flight Recorder</li>

	<li>HotSpot Serviceability Agent</li>

	<li>HotSpot Debugger</li>

	<li>DTrace</li>

	<li>Javac Server</li>

	<li>Java Sound</li>

	<li>SCTP</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	In addition, support for the aarch64, i386 and powerpc64
	architectures
	was also added.</p>

      <p>With most features supported, attention turned to
	compliance, using the
	internal JDK test suite as a method of measuring this.
	Most work during
	the third quarter has focused on this, with test failures
	dropping from
	50+ failures to only 2 tier1 test failures (which don't
	appear to impact
	functionality at all). Some significant fixes include:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A stack overflow crash</li>

	<li>Errors in external process handling</li>

	<li>The unpack200 utility (on little endian systems)</li>

	<li>HotSpot Debugger functionality such as thread enumeration</li>

	<li>Networking functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Finally, this work has been forward ported to Java 12 and
	13, with FreeBSD
	gaining support for these versions on or just after the
	day of release.</p>

      <p>Note that this work has been a collaboration with many
	others. While there
	are too many contributors to list here (please take a look
	at the commit
	history of the GitHub repository), I'd like to recognise
	Kurt Miller of
	OpenBSD for his tireless work as a co-collaborator on Java
	for BSD through
	many years.</p>

      <p>I'm also grateful to the sponsorship of the FreeBSD
	Foundation, which has
	allowed me to focus on this work for Q3.</p>

      <p>The <i>KDE on FreeBSD</i> project packages the
	software produced by
	the KDE Community for FreeBSD. The software includes a
	full desktop environment, the art application
	<a href="https://kdenlive.org" shape="rect">https://kdenlive.org</a>
	and hundreds of other applications that can be used on
	any FreeBSD desktop machine.</p>

      <p>Along with KDE itself, the team maintains the Qt
	libraries, the CMake
	build system, and a handful of other C++ libraries used in
	the KDE stack.</p>

      <p>The upstream releases KDE Frameworks (libraries) on a
	monthly
	cycle, KDE Plasma (the desktop environment) quarterly and
	a collection of KDE Applications (usable everywhere) twice
	a year.
	The KDE on FreeBSD team chased a dozen updates to these
	components
	so that FreeBSD remains one of the most up-to-date systems
	with KDE software (and Qt).</p>

      <p>A large (and possibly breaking, still needs more
	investigation)
	change came with the release to KDE's Digikam 6.3.0, which
	stopped
	using its previous plugins system (the "old" plugins are
	still used
	by other KDE software).</p>

      <p>A new entry in the net-im category was added for Ruqola, a
	Rocket.chat client for rich instant-messaging.</p>

      <p>CMake was updated twice. This forces the rebuild of
	several thousand
	C++-based ports. The KDE on FreeBSD team then fixes those
	ports,
	regardless of whether the error is in the CMake update, or
	in
	the upstream code. These updates tend to take a large
	amount of effort,
	since they touch unfamiliar (and often very-very-legacy)
	code.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Ports Management Team, tasked with overseeing
	the Ports Tree and
	its committers, reports that the following events happened
	during 2019Q3:</p>

      <p>The number of ports grew to just under 38,000 during the
	last quarter. We have
	just over 2,000 open ports PRs, of which 400 are
	unassigned. In this period,
	169 committers made 7,340 commits to HEAD and 561 commits
	to the quarterly
	branch. This shows that the trend of last quarter of
	increased activity is
	continuing.</p>

      <p>During the last quarter, we welcomed Santhosh Raju (fox@)
	and Dmitri Goutnik
	(dmgk@) to the team, and said goodbye to gabor@. During
	the last quarter,
	feld@ decided to step down from the portmgr@ and
	ports-secteam@ teams. We
	would like to thank them for their past services.</p>

      <p>In the last three months, bapt@ put on his engineering hat
	and released a new
	version of pkg (1.12), added support for overlays to the
	Ports Tree, fixed
	two Make targets (deinstall-depends and reinstall), and
	cleaned up
	bsd.sites.mk.</p>

      <p>On the infrastructure side, USES=pure became obsolete and
	has therefore been
	removed, and two new USES, xorg and xorg-cat have been
	added and replace the
	old bsd.xorg.mk. Two new keywords, ldconfig and
	ldconfig-linux, were added to
	simplify formatting of package lists.</p>

      <p>A number of default versions changed: Lazarus to 2.0.4,
	Linux to CentOS 7,
	LLVM to 9.0, Perl to 5.30, PostgreSQL to 11, and Ruby to
	2.6. Of the big
	user-visible ports, Firefox got updated to 69.0.1,
	Firefox-esr to 68.1.0,
	Chromium to 76.0.3809.132, and Xfce to 4.14.</p>

      <p>During the last quarter, antoine@ ran 48 exp-runs to test
	package updates, test
	updating bsd.java.mk, test the new ldconfig and
	ldconfig-linux keywords, test
	default version updates, test the new xorg and xorg-cat
	USES, test base
	updates, and test various improvements to Go and Ruby.</p>

	</p>
      <p>On September 19th the XFCE desktop environment ports have
	been updated
	to the recently released XFCE 4.14 version.</p>

      <p>These updates include upgrades of all the main XFCE
	components to the
	latest versions which have been migrated to GTK3, with few
	exceptions.
	Base components still require and link to GTK2 in addition
	to GTK3 to
	allow older GTK2 XFCE applications, for example panel
	plugins, to keep
	working.</p>

      <p>Due to this change the gtk-xfce-engine theme is deprecated
	since it only
	supports GTK2. The XFCE metaport by default installs the
	greybird theme,
	but it is not enabled by default.</p>

      <p>This new version also includes now it's own
	xfce4-screensaver program
	which is installed by default.</p>

      <p>Finally the default Display Manager on which XFCE depends
	has been
	changed to LightDM.</p>

      <p>Some regressions were reported in bugzilla. In particular
	the one
	affecting most users is a regression in the window
	manager: on specific
	graphic display hardware the window manager fails to
	properly draw
	window decorations, which appear black and blocky on
	affected systems.</p>

      <p>This problem has also been reported in the upstream bug
	tracker and a
	solution is being sought.</p>

      <p>If anyone is experiencing this display glitch and is able
	to test,
	please contact xfce@freebsd.org to help trying to figure
	out a solution.</p>

      <h3>What is ClonOS?</h3>

      <p>ClonOS is a turnkey open-source platform based on FreeBSD
	and the CBSD
	framework. ClonOS offers a complete web UI for an easy
	control, deployment
	and management of FreeBSD jails containers and bhyve/Xen
	hypervisor virtual
	environments.</p>

      <p>ClonOS is currently the only available platforms which
	allow both Xen and bhyve
	hypervisors to coexist on the same host. Since ClonOS is a
	FreeBSD-based
	platform, it has the ability to create and manage jails
	natively, allowing
	you to run FreeBSD applications without losing
	performance.</p>

      <h3>ClonOS/CBSD 2019Q3 Status Report</h3>

      <ul>
	<li>Added support for cloud-init (Linux/BSD VMs) and
	cloudbase-init
	(Windows VMs). It gives the ability to use FreeBSD as IaaS
	platform
	for instant deployment and usage of virtual machines based
	on bhyve
	hypervisor.</li>

	<li>Project started to use own cloud images for better
	stability and
      	resiliency.</li>

	<li>New mirrors in France, US and Canada were added for
      	distributing ISO/cloud-init images in addition to Russia,
	Latvia and
	Ukraine.</li>

	<li>Now we're using Jenkins CI for testing regular ClonOS
	builds:
	<a href="https://jenkins.ircdriven.net/job/Update%20clonos%20packages./" shape="rect">Update
	clonos packages</a> (Thanks to Daniel Shafer)</li>

	<li>New pkg repository was deployed to support ClonOS
	installation
	from packages (at this moment only FreeBSD-12 packages are
	available)
	<a href="https://pkg.ircdriven.net/packages/12amd64-clonos/" shape="rect">ClonOS
	package repo</a> (Thanks to Daniel Shafer)</li></ul>

      <p>
	Open issues and tasks:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Volunteers, contributors and testers are urgently needed
	to
      	distribute ClonOS on FreeBSD environments.</li>

	<li>We'd like to expand our mirrors number geographically,
	your help and contribution will be much appriciated.</li>

	<li>We're urgently looking for hosting sponsorship for various
      developing and testing activities.</li></ul>

      <p>ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) is the smart NIC available
	in the
	virtualized environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The
	ENA
	driver supports multiple transmit and receive queues and
	can handle
	up to 100 Gb/s of network traffic, depending on the
	instance type
	on which it is used.</p>

      <p>ENAv2 has been under development for FreeBSD, similar to
	Linux
	and DPDK. Since the last update internal review and
	improvements
	of the patches were done, followed by validation on
	various AWS
	instances.</p>

      <p>Completed since the last update:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Verification and review of the NETMAP support</li>

	<li>Mapping of the memory as WC on A1 instances in order to
	enable LLQ mode</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Todo:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Upstream of NETMAP support</li>

	<li>Upstream of the fix for LLQ mode on A1 instances</li>

      <p>An experimental project has started to provide jail
	orchestration
	based on <tt>nomad</tt> and the jail framework
	<tt>pot</tt>, similarly to how
	orchestration works with docker.</p>

      <p>This model allows us to split the jail creation and the
	jail deployment.
	Jail images can be created and exported using the
	<tt>pot</tt> framework.
	The images can be deployed and orchestrated using
	<tt>nomad</tt>.
	A driver has been developed to allow <tt>nomad</tt> to
	interact with <tt>pot</tt>.</p>

      <p>One of the goals of this project is to use non-persistent
	jails as
	containers, allowing us to:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>define containers similar to Docker (but not identical,
	because
	the underlaying OS is different)</li>

	<li>identify potential missing features in FreeBSD to support
	such a computational model</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	In the next quarter, we will launch the first service
	based on this
	project.</p>

      <p>Next steps are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>provide more guides and howtos</li>

	<li>improve stability, extending the tests suite</li>

	<li>improving tooling to create/manage images</li>
      </ul>

	</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD kernel maintains a Management Information Base
	(MIB) where a
	component (object) represents a parameter of the system.
	The <i>sysctl</i> system
	call explores the MIB to find an object by its Object
	Identifier (OID) and
	calls its handler to get or set the value of the
	parameter. It is often
	necessary to find an object not to call its handler but to
	get its info
	(description, type, name, next object, etc.), so the
	kernel provides an
	undocumented interface implemented in kern_sysctl.c.</p>

      <p>sysctlinfo is a new interface to explore the sysctl MIB
	and to pass the info
	of an object to the userland. The project provides: a
	README, a manual, helper
	macros, examples, tests and converted tools.</p>

      <p>Primarily sysctlinfo provides a new set of sysctl nodes
	(corresponding to the
	kernel interface) to handle an object up to CTL_MAXNAME
	levels:
	sysctl.entryfakename, sysctl.entrydesc, sysctl.entrylabel,
	sysctl.entrykind,
	sysctl.entryfmt and sysctl.entrynextleaf. Moreover new
	features have been
	implemented: the support for the capability mode,
	sysctl.entryname,
	sysctl.entryidbyname and sysctl.entrynextnode. To get all
	the info about an
	object the kernel needs to find it many times, then the
	new
	sysctl.entryallinfo* nodes were written, they are 30%
	more efficient. Finally,
	*byname nodes were added: they search the object by its
	name avoiding to call
	sysctl.name2oid (or similar) to explore the MIB just to
	find the corresponding
	OID.</p>

      <p>sysctlinfo can be installed via <i>sysutils/sysctlinfo-kmod</i>
	or by applying the
	<i>sysctlinfo.diff</i> patch (more efficient than the module
	because uses a shared
	lock). The interface is used by <i>deskutils/sysctlview
	1.5</i>,
	<i>sysutils/nsysctl 1.2</i> and the converted version of
	sysctl(8), sysctlbyname(3),
	sysctlnametomib(3), they should be used to get the value
	of an object with 23/24
	levels or if some level-name has only the '\0' character.
	In the future a new
	<i>byname</i> node will be added to allow sysctlbyname() to
	manage a CTLTYPE_NODE with
	a no-NULL handler, example
	sysctlbyname("kern.proc.pid.\&lt;pid\&gt;").</p>

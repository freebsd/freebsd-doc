After the doc migration to Hugo/AsciiDoctor the Weblate tool it's opened again.

There are three projects on our Weblate:

* Documentation (Books and Articles) - open
* FreeBSD Doc (Archived) - former project
* Website - pending

Language teams that were using Weblate before the migration to Hugo/AsciiDoctor, please see our link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocTranslationOnWeblate#Translation_based_on_Automatic_Suggestions[Translation based on Automatic Suggestions Wiki article] for more details.

We've just started a project for converting the old method of automatically translating strings, using the Machine Translation feature, to a new system that will work for the new documentation.
This will save time for our translators.

There are still pending items: you can check the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocTranslationOnWeblate#Status[Status Page]; any help is very welcome.

The next step for the new quarter is to prepare and release the Website translations through Weblate as well.

==== What is CBSD?

CBSD is a management layer written for the FreeBSD man:jail[8] subsystem, man:bhyve[8] and man:xen[4].
CBSD allows users to manage jail/bhyve/xen environments at different levels of abstraction by providing a varied number of unified methods: vagrant-like `CBSDfiles`, `CLI` and via man:dialog[1].

==== CBSD 2021Q1 Status Report

A RestAPI service layer was added during last quarter, enabling creation of programmable cloud solutions.
In addition, work has been done to support RestAPI through a `CBSDfile`, allowing for private cloud environments deployment.
In such cases the local CBSD layer acts as a thin client.

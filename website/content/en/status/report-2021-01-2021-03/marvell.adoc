The Semihalf team is working on improving the FreeBSD support for the

Marvell Armada 7k8k and Octeon TX2 CN913x SoC families are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with high speed peripherals including 10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide range of networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Although the mentioned SoCs are mostly supported in FreeBSD HEAD, some pieces required improvements.

Applied changes:

* Add missing frequency modes in ap806_clock driver (link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=a86b0839d7bf3fc06b1ae[commit a86b0839d7bf])
* Multiple fixes in mvebu_gpio driver - in cooperation with mmel (link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=a5dce53b75d8750ba[commit a5dce53b75d8])
* Fix device tree data parsing in mv\_ap806\_gicp interrupt controller driver (link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=622d17da46eb360c3d684[commit 622d17da46eb])
* Rework the ICU interrupt controller (mv\_cp110\_icu) and its parent (mv\_ap806\_gicp), so that they no longer rely on the data provided by firmware, which fixes booting the OS from the newer U-Boot/TF-A revisions (link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D28803[D28803])
* PCIE Designware driver (pci_dw) fixes:
** Correct setting of outbound I/O ATU window.
** Allow mapping ATU windows bigger than 4GB.
* Generic improvements that enable proper user-space mapping and access of the PCI BARs

TODO:

* Upstream PCIE improvements.
* Improve and merge ICU support rework.

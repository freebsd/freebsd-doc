==== What is helloSystem?

helloSystem is FreeBSD preconfigured as a desktop operating system with a focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability.
Its design follows the “Less, but better” philosophy.

==== Q1 2021 Status

* helloSystem and some of the motivations and core ideas behind it were presented at the FOSDEM 2021 BSD Devroom in the talk link:https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/hello_bsd/["hello... again? Simplicity, elegance, and usability for the desktop"]. Video recordings of the talk and Q&A session are available link:https://video.fosdem.org/2021/D.bsd/hello_bsd.webm[WebM/VP9], link:https://video.fosdem.org/2021/D.bsd/hello_bsd.mp4[mp4]
* Version 0.4.0 of helloSystem was published. Installable Live ISO images are available.
* Work has started towards 0.5.0. We are beginning to see contributed features and bugfixes
** System menu reflects changes made in Applications immediately
** Filer file manager brings already-open windows to the front rather than opening multiple windows for the same folder
** Initial spatial mode option (each folder opens in its own window in the file manager that remembers its on-screen location)

Experimental and release builds of the Live ISO are available at https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases.

=== DOCNG on FreeBSD

Contact: Sergio Carlavilla <carlavilla@FreeBSD.org>

The Doc New Generation project is finished.
The switch-over date was Saturday, January 23rd.

But there's a list of remaining tasks:

* Convert the Python scripts to Ruby using the AsciiDoctor API
* Convert from releases from 4.4 to 9.0 to AsciiDoctor
* Use rouge in the source sections instead of the CSS hack
* Split the news page to reduce the total size of the page
* Split the books
* Improve the FDP book

If you want to reduce the TODO list, give me a ping :)

The FreeBSD Office team works on a number of office-related software suites and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

Work during this quarter was focused on providing the latest stable release of LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

Latest and quarterly ports branches got a new branch (7.1) of the LibreOffice suite and updated to 7.1.1 release.

Meanwhile, our link:https://github.org/freebsd/freebsd-ports-libreoffice[WIP repository] got back a working CI instance again, thanks to Li-Wen Hsu.

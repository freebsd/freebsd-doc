          <div id="contentwrap"><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This report will be covering FreeBSD related projects between April and June,
and covers a diverse set of topics ranging from kernel updates over userland
and ports, as well as third-party work.
</p><p>Some highlights picked with the roll of a d100 include, but are not limited to,
the ability to forcibly unmount UFS when the underlying media becomes
inaccessible, added preliminary support for Bluetooth Low Energy, a introduction to the
FreeBSD Office Hours, and a repository of software collections called potluck
to be installed with the pot utility, as well as many many more things.
</p><p>As a little treat, readers can also get a rare report from the quarterly team.
</p><p>Finally, on behalf of the quarterly team, I would like to extend my deepest
appreciation and thank you to salvadore@, who decided to take down his shingle.
His contributions to not just the quarterly reports themselves, but also the
surrounding tooling to many-fold ease the work, are immeasurable.

	Contact: Deb Goodkin &lt;<a href="mailto:deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org">deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to
supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.  Funding
comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to fund and manage
software development projects, conferences and developer summits, and provide
travel grants to FreeBSD contributors.  The Foundation purchases and supports
hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure and provides resources
to improve security, quality assurance, and release engineering efforts;
publishes marketing material to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD
Project; facilitates collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD
developers; and finally, represents the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts,
license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require a recognized
legal entity.
</p>
<p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD last quarter:
</p>
<h3>COVID-19 Impact on the Foundation</h3>

<p>Like other organizations, we put policies in place for all of our staff members
to work from home.  We also put a temporary ban on travel for staff members.
We are continuing our work supporting the community and Project, but some of
our work and responses may be delayed because of changes in some of our
priorities and the impact of limited childcare for a few of our staff members.
</p>
<h3>Partnerships and Commercial User Support</h3>

<p>We help facilitate collaboration between commercial users and FreeBSD
developers.  We also meet with companies to discuss their needs and bring that
information back to the Project.  Not surprisingly, the stay at home orders,
combined with our company ban on travel during Q2 made in-person meetings
non-existent.  However, the team was able to continue meeting with our partners
and commercial users virtually. These meetings help us understand some of the
applications where FreeBSD is used.
</p>
<h3>Fundraising Efforts</h3>

<p>Last quarter we raised $268,400!  Thank you to the individuals and organizations
that stepped in to help fund our efforts.  We&#8217;d like to thank Netflix, employees
of Nginx, Beckhoff Automation, and Mozilla Foundation for their large
contributions last quarter, which helped bring our 2020 fundraising effort to
$339k.  We hope other organizations will follow their lead and give back to help
us continue supporting FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>These are trying times, and we deeply appreciate every donation that has come in
from $5 to $150,000. We&#8217;re still here giving 110% to supporting FreeBSD!
</p>
<p>We are 100% funded by donations, and those funds go towards software development
work to improve FreeBSD, FreeBSD advocacy around the world, keeping FreeBSD
secure, continuous integration improvements, sponsoring BSD-related and
computing conferences (even the virtual events!), legal support for the Project,
and many other areas.
</p>
<p>Please consider making a
<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/." shape="rect">donation to help us continue and increase our support for FreeBSD</a>.
</p>
<p>We also have the Partnership Program, to provide more benefits for our larger
commercial donors.  Find out more information about the
<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/" shape="rect">partnership program</a>
and share with your companies!
</p>
<h3>OS Improvements</h3>

<p>A number of FreeBSD Foundation grant recipients started, continued working on,
or completed projects during the second quarter.  These include:
</p><ul>
<li><p>WiFi improvements
</p></li>
<li><p>Linuxulator application compatibility
</p></li>
<li><p>DRM / Graphics driver updates
</p></li>
<li><p>Zstd compression for OpenZFS
</p></li>
<li><p>Online RAID-Z expansion
</p></li>
<li><p>if_bridge performance improvements
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You can find more details about most of these projects in other quarterly
reports.
</p>
<p>Staff members also worked on a number of larger projects, including:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Run-Time Dynamic Linker (rtld) improvements
</p></li>
<li><p>Improved FreeBSD support on Microsoft HyperV and Azure
</p></li>
<li><p>Fine-grained locking for amd64 pmap
</p></li>
<li><p>5-level paging structures for amd64
</p></li>
<li><p>Non-transparent superpages
</p></li>
<li><p>Migration to a Git repository
</p></li>
<li><p>Tool chain modernization
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Many of these projects also have detailed entries in other quarterly report
entries.
</p>
<p>Staff members also put in significant effort in many ways other than larger,
individual projects.  These include assisting with code reviews, bug report
triage, security report triage and advisory handling, addressing syzkaller
reports, and ongoing maintenance and bug fixes in functional areas such as the
tool chain, developer tools, virtual memory kernel subsystem, low-level x86
infrastructure, sockets and protocols, and others.
</p>
<h3>University of Waterloo Co-op</h3>

<p>Foundation co-op students Colin, Tiger, and Yang completed their winter 2020
work term during the second quarter, and continued on with the next school term
in their respective programs.  Although COVID-19 presented a unique challenge
and prompted an abrupt transition to remote work just over half way through the
term, all three learned a lot and provided positive contributions to the FreeBSD
Project and to the Foundation.
</p>
<p>A few projects that were in progress or completed during the work term were
committed to the FreeBSD tree in the second quarter.
</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member who is working on improving
continuous integration, automated testing, and overall quality assurance
efforts for the FreeBSD project.
</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2020, Foundation staff continued improving the
Project's CI infrastructure, monitoring regressions and working with
contributors to fix the failing build and test cases.  The setting up of VM host
for CI jobs and staging environment is in progress.  We are also working with
other teams in the Project for their testing needs.  For example, we added jobs
for running full tests on non-x86 architectures.  We are also working with many
external projects and companies to improve their support of FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for completed work items and detailed
information.
</p>
<h3>Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve FreeBSD infrastructure.
Last quarter, we continued supporting FreeBSD hardware located around the world.
We started working on getting the new NYI Chicago colocation facility prepared
for some of the new FreeBSD hardware we are planning on purchasing.
NYI generously provides this for free to the Project.
</p>
<h3>FreeBSD Advocacy and Education</h3>

<p>A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for the Project.  This
includes promoting work being done by others with FreeBSD; producing advocacy
literature to teach people about FreeBSD and help make the path to starting
using FreeBSD or contributing to the Project easier; and attending and getting
other FreeBSD contributors to volunteer to run FreeBSD events, staff FreeBSD
tables, and give FreeBSD presentations.
</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and summits around the
globe.  These events can be BSD-related, open source, or technology events
geared towards underrepresented groups.  We support the FreeBSD-focused events
to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to work together on projects, and
to facilitate collaboration between developers and commercial users.  This all
helps provide a healthy ecosystem.  We support the non-FreeBSD events to promote
and raise awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in different
applications, and to recruit more contributors to the Project.  As is the case
for most of us in this industry, COVID-19 has put our in-person events on hold.
In addition to attending virtual events, we are continually working on new
training initiatives and updating our selection of how-to guides to facilitate
getting more folks to try out FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>Check out some of the advocacy and education work we did last quarter:

find information more easily and to make the site more efficient.  We look
forward to unveiling the refreshed site in Q3.
</p>
<h3>Foundation Board Meeting</h3>

<p>Our annual board meeting was held on Tuesday June 2, 2020.  We normally hold
this meeting the Tuesday before BSDCan, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, but with the
company travel ban, and the conference going virtual, our meeting went virtual
for the first time.  The purpose of the annual board meeting is to hold our
board director and officer elections, review work accomplished over the past
year, and put together strategic goals for the upcoming 12 months.
</p>
<p>The board generally has two all-day board meetings each year, this one, and a
more informal one in January, typically held in Berkeley.  Both meetings allow
us to connect, reevaluate and discuss new ideas, while assessing what we should
do to help the Project.
</p>
<p>Some of our longer-term goals include Growing User and Developer Communities,
Developing Training and OS Course Content, Improving desktop/laptop experience,
Promoting FreeBSD (as you can see in all the advocacy work listed above), and
Improving Testing Capabilities.
</p>
<p>Results of the director and officer elections were:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Justin Gibbs (President)
</p></li>
<li><p>Benedict Reuschling (Vice President)
</p></li>
<li><p>Kirk McKusick (Treasurer)
</p></li>
<li><p>Philip Paeps (Secretary)
</p></li>
<li><p>Deb Goodkin (Assistant Secretary)
</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Watson (Director)

<h3>Legal/FreeBSD IP</h3>

<p>The Foundation owns the FreeBSD trademarks, and it is our responsibility to
protect them.  We also provide legal support for the core team to investigate
questions that arise.
</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/" shape="rect">the FreeBSD Foundation's web site</a> to
find out how we support FreeBSD and how we can help you!
</p><hr /><h2><a name="FreeBSD-Core-Team" href="#FreeBSD-Core-Team" id="FreeBSD-Core-Team">FreeBSD Core Team</a></h2><p>
	Contact: FreeBSD Core Team &lt;<a href="mailto:core@FreeBSD.org">core@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>The Core Team held 10 meetings during the second quarter of 2020, including a
2020-05-21 joint meeting with members of the FreeBSD Foundation.  Here are some
highlights from that meeting:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deb requested guidance on how the Foundation can support the community.
    Core and Foundation members believe that more developer support is necessary
    to fill gaps in areas where commercial customers do not provide backing.
    The clearest example of such a gap is the desktop experience, including
    graphics and wireless support.  What makes this request different from past
    requests is that rather than support for one-time projects, ongoing
    positions are necessary for a consistently high-quality desktop experience.
</p>
<p>        "FreeBSD not being able to run on your laptop is the first step to
         irrelevance." Ed Maste
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both teams discussed topics for upcoming sessions of FreeBSD Office Hours,
    informal FreeBSD video conferences that anyone can attend.  Everyone agreed
    that the Office Hours have been a useful way for different parts of the
    Project to engage with each other and with the wider community.  Kudos to
    Allan Jude for initiating the Office Hours and for everyone who has helped
    make them a success by hosting or attending sessions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both teams agreed that they should meet once per quarter.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The second annual community survey closed on 2020-06-16.  The purpose of the
survey is to collect data from the public to help guide the Project's efforts
and priorities.  As an example, last year's survey results helped initiate the
Project's conversion to Git.  Thank you to all who took the time to respond. The
results will be released soon.
</p>
<p>The Core-initiated Git Working Group continued to make progress, but there are
still some remaining issues to be worked out with the translation from
Subversion.  Hopefully the new Git src repository will be ready for use this
summer.  A <a href="https://cgit-beta.freebsd.org/" shape="rect">beta version</a> has been published for
people to test and a preliminary version of a <code>Using Git for FreeBSD
Development</code> primer will soon be ready to share.  Core, the Git Working Group,
and Release Engineering are working towards the goal of releasing 12.2 from the
new Git repository.
</p>
<p>Following the results of a Core-initiated developer survey, The FreeBSD Project
has adopted a new LLVM-derived [code of
conduct](https://www.freebsd.org/internal/code-of-conduct.html).
</p>
<p>The eleventh FreeBSD Core Team was elected by active developers.  From a pool of
23, the 9 successful candidates for core.11 are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sean Chittenden (seanc, incumbent)
</p></li>
<li><p>Baptiste Daroussin (bapt)
</p></li>
<li><p>Kyle Evans (kevans)
</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Johnston (markj)
</p></li>
<li><p>Scott Long (scottl)
</p></li>
<li><p>Warner Losh (imp, incumbent)
</p></li>
<li><p>Ed Maste (emaste)
</p></li>
<li><p>George V. Neville-Neil (gnn)
</p></li>
<li><p>Hiroki Sato (hrs, incumbent)
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A new Core Team secretary, Muhammad Moinur Rahman (bofh), was unanimously
approved by core.11.  The outgoing core team met three times with the new core
team to help with the transition.  Core.10 wishes core.11 a successful term.

	</p><p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code slushes, and maintaining the respective
branches, among other things.
</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2020, the Release Engineering Team started
work on the 11.4-RELEASE cycle, the fifth release from the stable/11
branch.  The release cycle went quite smoothly, with both BETA3 and RC3
removed from the schedule.  This allowed the final release to occur one
week earlier than originally scheduled, which was announced June 16.
FreeBSD 11.4-RELEASE is expected to be the final 11.x release.
</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team would like to thank everyone involved
in this cycle for their hard work.
</p>
<p>Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the <i>head</i>, <i>stable/12</i>, and <i>stable/11</i> branches.
</p>
<p>Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (netgate.com)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.

<p>The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system
for the FreeBSD project.  The CI system firstly checks the committed changes
can be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results.
The artifacts from the build jobs are archived in the artifact server for
further testing and debugging needs.  The CI team members examine the
failing builds and unstable tests and work with the experts in that area to
fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.  The details of these efforts
are available in the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@FreeBSD-CI" shape="rect">weekly CI reports</a>.
</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2020, we continue working with the contributors and developers in the project for their testing needs and also keep working with external projects and companies to improve their support of FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>Important changes:
</p><ul>
<li><p>All -test jobs will run tests under <code>/usr/tests</code>, previously only x86 architectures were doing this. See the Continuous Integration on !x86 section in this report for more information.
</p></li>
<li><p>Compression algorithm of disk images on the <a href="https://artifacts.ci.freebsd.org" shape="rect">artifact server</a> has been changed to zstd to speed up compression and decompression.
</p></li>
<li><p>The build and test results will be sent to the <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/dev-ci" shape="rect">dev-ci mailing list</a> soon. Feedback and help with analysis is very appreciated!
</p>

	</p><p>The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the
overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and
personnel matters.  Below is what happened in the last quarter.
</p>
<p>There are currently 2,373 open ports PRs of which 526 are
unassigned, for a total of 39,628 ports.  In the last quarter
there were 10,315 commits to HEAD and 476 to the quarterly
branch by respectively 178 and 65 committers.  Compared to the
quarter before, this means a significant increase in commits and
also a slight decrease in open PRs.
</p>
<p>During the last quarter, we welcomed Hiroki Tagato (tagattie@).
We said goodbye to seanc@, zleslie@, gnn@ and salvadore@.
</p>
<p>A few default versions got bumped:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Java (new) at 8
</p></li>
<li><p>Lazarus to 2.0.8
</p>
</li></ul>
It is now possible to write pkg scripts in Lua instead of sh.
<p>They have two advantages over their sh versions:
</p><ul>
<li><p>they run in a Capsicum sandbox
</p></li>
<li><p>they respect rootdir, the directory which pkg will use as
    the starting point to install all packages under.
</p>
</li></ul>
Some user-facing packages were also updated:
<ul>
<li><p>pkg to 1.14.6
</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox to 78.0.1
</p></li>
<li><p>Thunderbird to 68.10.0
</p></li>
<li><p>Chromium to 83.0.4103.116
</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby to 2.5.8, 2.6.6, and 2.7.1
</p></li>
<li><p>Qt5 to 5.14.2
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>During the last quarter, antoine@ ran 55 exp-runs to test port
version updates, make liblzma use libmd, flavor devel/scons and
Lua ports, add and update library functions in the base system,
make malloc.h usable again, remove as(1) from the base system, and
augment sed(1) with -f.

	</p><p>Starting on the first of April 2020, the FreeBSD project has started
hosting regular video streams to foster greater communication within
the wider FreeBSD community. The first of these sessions took the form
of a public question and answer session, which drew over 60 participants.
A second session was held two weeks later at a time more appropriate for
those in Asia, but only drew 20 participants. With the help of the FreeBSD
Foundation, we ran a poll to discover what times worked best for the
greatest number of people.
</p>
<p>On May 13th the FreeBSD Foundation hosted a session where the community
could ask questions of or about the foundation. On May 27th many of the
candidates for the new FreeBSD Core Team joined an office hours session to
answer questions from the community. Finally on June 24th another general
question and answer office hours was held.
</p>
<p>Each office hours session consists of a video meeting of some FreeBSD
developers or other subject matter experts, live streamed along with an IRC
chat room for viewers to pose questions to the panel. The stream is recorded
and posted to the official FreeBSD youtube channel.

	</p><p>The Quarterly Status Reports Team collects and publishes the reports that you are
reading right now.
</p>
<p>Many improvements have been done recently and thus we believe it is useful that
the Quarterly Status Reports Team submits a report. Not all the changes below
are specific to the last quarter, but we list them here anyway since we did not
write an entry for earlier reports.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reports are now built using Makefiles. Among the many advantages, this allows
  us to easily sort reports logically. Indeed, starting with 2019Q4, all reports
  are sorted logically, while before they were sorted alphabetically within each
  category.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The conversion from markdown to docbook was performed using a python script,
  with some known bugs. Salvadore has rewritten the script using perl fixing
  most of the bugs. Some features are missing and many improvements are
  possible, but the script is very unlikely to receive any change since it will
  become obsolete as soon as the conversion to Hugo/AsciiDoctor is completed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another perl script to ease the preparation of the mail version of the
  reports was written.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>One more perl script has been written to allow the quarterly team to send
  quarterly calls automatically using a cron job. We used it this quarter for
  the first time.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you might have noticed, last quarterly calls have been sent to
  freebsd-quarterly-calls@: this is a new mailing list to which you can
  <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-quarterly-calls" shape="rect">subscribe</a>
  to receive calls for quarterly reports. Please note this is a moderated list,
  with very low traffic and a high signal to noise ratio.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you read carefully the last quarterly calls, you should have noticed that
  we now ask you to send reports to quarterly-submissions@ instead of
  quarterly@. This was done to help the quarterly team distinguishing internal
  discussions from submissions. Please keep in mind however that the quarterly
  team prefers receiving pull requests, as they ease the administrative work.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>We would like to thank philip@, from the postmaster team, for having created the
freebsd-quarterly-calls@ mailing list and the quarterly-submissions@ address for
us.

	</p><p>Work continues on FreeBSD's migration from Subversion to Git.  Ulrich has
iterated on updates to svn2git in order to improve the fidelity of the
conversion, particularly in regards to vendor (contrib) code updates.
We believe the conversion is now at an acceptable state, but may make minor
adjustments if additional issues are found.  We expect to push modifications
to the converter every two weeks (first and third Sunday of the month).  This
means that commit hashes in the beta repo will remain stable for at least two
weeks at a time, to allow others to test and experiment with the beta repo.
</p>
<p>We are now working on updating FreeBSD processes and documentation.
This includes:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Writing a Git Primer, akin to the existing Subversion primer
</p></li>
<li><p>Updates to the Security Team's tools and processes
</p></li>
<li><p>Release engineering updates
</p></li>
<li><p>Ports and packages process updates
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Those with an interest in the migration to Git are encouraged to subscribe
to the
<a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-git" shape="rect">FreeBSD-git mailing list</a>
and test out the beta src, ports, and/or doc repositories.
</p>
<p>You are also welcome to check out the wiki, issues, README and other documentation at the
<a href="https://github.com/freebsd/git_conv" shape="rect">Git conversion tooling repo</a>.
</p>
<p>We expect to be ready for the migration in the next quarter.

	</p><p>Lua is a small, efficient scripting language that FreeBSD imported before
FreeBSD 12.0 for use in the bootloader.  Since then, several projects
outside of the bootloader have gained some amount of traction with Lua usage:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>/usr/libexec/flua is now installed for internal usage
</p></li>
<li><p>makesyscalls.sh was rewritten in Lua
</p></li>
<li><p>pkg has gained support for lua scripts
</p></li>
<li><p>lldb in the base system now supports lua scripting
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>FreeBSD Lua ("flua") is a version of the lua interpreter that has several
modules built-in for convenient usage within the base system.  flua is
installed with a non-standard name and in a location not included in $PATH
so that it is not accidentally found by third-party software or configure
scripts.  The FreeBSD project makes no guarantees about upgrade cadence or
module stability.  That said, it is available for use by downstream projects
and FreeBSD users aware of those limitations.
</p>
<p>Previous work with flua includes, for example, adding libucl support and
future work includes libifconfig support for scripting usage.
</p>
<p>People interested in working with Lua in FreeBSD are welcome to get in
contact to discuss other project ideas.  To name a couple of potential
projects, some interesting modules that have not been started but could
prove useful (listed in no particular order):
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>libcrypt
</p></li>
<li><p>libexpat

	Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala &lt;<a href="mailto:trasz@FreeBSD.org">trasz@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>Earlier Linuxulator work focused on code cleanups and improving
diagnostic tools.
Work has now shifted from cleanups to fixing actual applications.
Current status is being tracked at
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LinuxApps" shape="rect">Linux app status Wiki page</a>.
Initial focus is on applications that don't involve X11, mostly
because they tend to be easier to test and debug, and the bug fixes
are not application-specific.
</p>
<p>Example problems fixed include buggy madvise(2) handling, which could
break applications linked against jemalloc; uname(2) returning wrong
results for 32 bit apps, which caused problems for Steam; recvmsg(2)

	Contact: Rick Macklem &lt;<a href="mailto:rmacklem@freebsd.org">rmacklem@freebsd.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>In an effort to improve NFS security, an internet draft
which I expect will become an RFC soon specifies the
use of TLS 1.3 to encrypt all data traffic on a Sun RPC
connection used for NFS.
</p>
<p>Although NFS has been able to use sec=krb5p to encrypt data
on the wire, this requires a Kerberos environment and, as
such, has not been widely adopted. It also required that
encryption/decryption be done in software, since only the
RPC message NFS arguments are encrypted.
Since Kernel TLS is capable of using hardware assist to
improve performance and does not require Kerberos, NFS
over TLS may be more widely adopted, once implementations
are available.
</p>
<p>The project to implement this has largely been completed.
The code will slowly be merged into head/current and at least
the kernel portion should be in FreeBSD-13.
</p>
<p>To support clients such as laptops, the daemons that perform the TLS
handshake may optionally handle client X.509 certificates from a
site local CA. There are now exports(5) options to require client(s) to
provide a valid X.509 certificate.
</p>
<p>The code is now available for testing. See:
https://people.freebsd.org/~rmacklem/nfs-over-tls-setup.txt
Setting up system(s) for testing is still a little awkward, as explained
by the above rough document.
</p>
<p>The main limitation in the current implementation is that it uses TLS1.2
and not TLS1.3. This should change once the KERN_TLS rx patch includes
TLS1.3 support.
Also, testing of pNFS configurations has not yet been done, but will
be tested soon.
</p>
<p>Third party testing would be appreciated.

	</p><p>Commit -r361491 on May 25, 2020 enables a UFS file system to do a
forcible unmount when the underlying media fails or becomes
inaccessible. For example when a USB flash memory card hosting a
UFS file system is unplugged.
</p>
<p>The rest of this report describes in more detail how forcible
unmounts are done. Surprisingly, less than 500 lines of file
system code were added or changed.
</p>
<p>The strategy for handling disk I/O errors when soft updates are
enabled is to stop writing to the disk of the affected file system
but continue to accept I/O requests and report that all future
writes by the file system to that disk actually succeed. Then
initiate an asynchronous forced unmount of the affected file system.
</p>
<p>There are two cases for disk I/O errors:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ENXIO, which means that this disk is gone and the lower layers
     of the storage stack already guarantee that no future I/O to
     this disk will succeed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>EIO (or most other errors), which means that this particular
     I/O request has failed but subsequent I/O requests to this
     disk might still succeed.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For ENXIO, we can just clear the error and continue, because we
know that the file system cannot affect the on-disk state after we
see this error. For EIO or other errors, we arrange for the geom_vfs
layer to reject all future I/O requests with ENXIO just like is
done when the geom_vfs is orphaned. In both cases, the file system
code can just clear the error and proceed with the forcible unmount.
</p>
<p>This new treatment of I/O errors is needed for writes of any buffer
that is involved in a dependency. Most dependencies are described
by a structure attached to the buffer's b_dep field, but some are
created and processed as a result of the completion of the dependencies
attached to the buffer.
</p>
<p>Clearing of some dependencies require a read. For example if there
is a dependency that requires an inode to be written, the disk block
containing that inode must be read, the updated inode copied into
place in that buffer, and the buffer then written back to disk.
</p>
<p>Often the needed buffer is already in memory and can be used. But
if it needs to be read from the disk, the read will fail, so we
fabricate a buffer full of zeroes and pretend that the read succeeded.
This zero'ed buffer can be updated and "written" back to disk.
</p>
<p>The only case where a buffer full of zeros causes the code to do
the wrong thing is when reading an inode buffer containing an inode
that still has an inode dependency in memory that will reinitialize
the effective link count (i_effnlink) based on the actual link count
(i_nlink) that we read. To handle this case we now store the i_nlink
value that we wrote in the inode dependency so that it can be
restored into the zero'ed buffer thus keeping the tracking of the
inode link count consistent.
</p>
<p>Because applications depend on knowing when an attempt to write
their data to stable storage has failed, the fsync(2) and msync(2)
system calls need to return errors if data fails to be written to
stable storage. So these operations return ENXIO for every call
made on files in a file system where we have otherwise been ignoring
I/O errors.

	</p><p>The Intel Wireless cards are one of the most commonly used
and asked for in FreeBSD notebooks.
</p>
<p>This project has three main goals:
</p><ul>
<li><p>newer Intel Wireless device support,
</p></li>
<li><p>newer WiFi standards support for Intel Wireless,
</p></li>
<li><p>integration of 802.11ac client support and infrastructure in FreeBSD.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The first one is needed as iwm(4) currently does not support
the latest generations of Intel Wireless cards at all.
The second is needed as in FreeBSD iwm(4) does not even support
802.11n.
The third one we want to catch up and use the improvements the
new Wifi standard offers, e.g., speed.
</p>
<p>One of the decisions made was: rather than improving iwm(4)
this work uses the dual-licensed native Linux driver under BSD license
and the linuxkpi framework to stay as close to upstream as possible as
a first step.
This will give us several advantages, such as, the full support for all
cards, quick support for new chipsets, vendor bug fixes, but also the
ability to contribute back.
</p>
<p>At this point the lower level hardware attachments and the firmware
loading and initialisation works.
I plan to release a patchset for testing before mid-July, you can see if
your currently supported or unsupported hardware will be detected.
This first cut will not support any wireless operation yet, which will follow
later in the year.

	</p><p>Since its introduction, x86 Long Mode (AKA 64bit execution mode, amd64
in FreeBSD terminology) uses 4-level paging structures, which provides
48 bits of virtual address space (LA48).  FreeBSD evenly divides the
space between userspace and kernel, giving both 47 virtual address
bits.
</p>
<p>In near future Intel CPUs will start providing 5-level paging
structures, i.e. giving 57 bits for virtual addresses (LA57).  This
means, with preservation of the existing divide between KVA and UVA,
56 bit for UVA, or 2^9 = 512 times more virtual memory.
</p>
<p>The amd64 pmap was modified to support both LA48 and LA57, defaulting
to LA57 if hardware supports it.  The tunable is provided to force
using LA48 even if hardware can do LA57.
</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the patch is the switch from boot paging
mode to LA57.  Loaders, either legacy or UEFI, pass control to the
kernel in Long Mode, which implies that the paging is turned on.  This
necessarily means that it is LA48 mode.  SDM states that paging mode
cannot be switched while Long Mode is active, so kernel has to create
new page table structures, turn Long Mode off, then load new %cr3 and
finally re-enable Long Mode.
</p>
<p>I decided to only provide the larger virtual address space to usermode
for the initial step, leaving KVA layout intact. The main motivation
is that changing KVA arrangements requires changing the auto-tuning
settings, which deserve separate work.  Another argument for it is
that most of the kernel memory is non-swappable, so cannot be
over-commited.  We have 2:1 ratio of useful KVA to physical memory
(due to direct map), and until machines get more physical address
lines, increasing KVA is not useful.
</p>
<p>After this was decided, creating a 5-level paging structure for kernel
pmap from existing 4-level one is quite straightforward; we need to
add one page for top level, create one PML5 entry to point to existing
PML4 page, and create the famous self-referential entry for
vtopte()/vtopde().
</p>
<p>Care was taken to provide binary compatible layout of UVA for binaries
that cannot be executed correctly with larger address space.  For
instance, programs could have knowledge about used bits in the
addresses and used upper bits for other data, or implemented
compressed pointers.  Even if system runs in LA57 mode, specific
binary can request LA48-compatible UVA by procctl(2) or by the flag in
the FreeBSD features ELF note.
</p>
<p>Since I do not have access to a machine with LA57, development was
done using QEMU.  It would be interesting to try it on the real
hardware.

	</p><p>FreeBSD already provides excellent support for superpages, in a
manner completely transparent to applications.  It tries to
proactively prevent fragmentation, reserves contiguous runs of the
physical pages for linear allocations in managed objects, and
auto-promote runs of small pages when they form complete superpage.
</p>
<p>The shortcomings of this approach directly follows from its strength:
some applications want to get guaranteed superpage mappings, typically
because the underlying physical memory is also offloaded into a
hardware which also has memory mapping unit.  For instance, Infiniband
RMDA adapters do memory registration and remapping, which is more
efficient with large pages.  In such cases transparent
(non-guaranteed) support cannot be used.
</p>
<p>The extension was developed for POSIX shared memory subsystem to allow
the creator request that the shared memory object was backed by
physically contiguous pages, with runs of specified size.  The mmap(2)
syscall is aware of such objects, and if the requested mapping is
properly aligned, it will be served by superpages.
</p>
<p>The new type of the shared memory objects are backed by a modified
physical pager, which only allocates contiguous physical memory.  The
VM ensures that mappings of the objects are never split (clipped) on a
non-superpage boundary.  The fault handler is specially optimized to
be very fast by quickly installing the superpage PTE, and to avoid
touching all small pages constituing it.
</p>
<p>Currently the required pmap support is provided for amd64 with 2M and
1G superpage sizes.

	</p><p>FreeBSD kernel Virtual Memory subsystem handles 'normal' application
memory, i.e. anonymous or file-backed shared and private mappings,
with so called managed pages.  Managed page is fully controlled by VM,
which tracks it status.  In particular, managed page can be made
read-only for write-back to the file, or unmapped for reuse (paging).
</p>
<p>The machine-dependent VM layer, pmap, must support managed pages, for
instance it must provide operations such as pmap_remove_write() to
downgrade all mappings to read-only, or pmap_remove_all() to unmap
the page from all address spaces.  To implement this kind of
operations, while not causing the overhead of scanning all page
tables, pmap must track existing mappings of the page.  The
tracking is done by allocating a small data structure 'pv entry'
per mapping, and linking all pv entries for the given page into pv
list.
</p>
<p>Since pv entries come from context of different address spaces, pmap
must provide synchronization to guarantee correctness of the list
structures.  Current pmap allocates one mutex per one 2M physical
superpage in NUMA configurations, and MAXCPU == 256 locks hashed by
the page physical address for non-NUMA.  The end result is often
undeserved lock aliasing causing pv list locks contention, since all
4k pages in the 2M superpage share the same lock, and reservations
typically cause adjusted pages to come from the same superpage.
</p>
<p>The proposed patch creates a new kernel synchronization primitive
called one byte mutex, which is embedded into the currently unused
padding in machine-dependent portion of the struct vm_page.  This way
each page gets dedicated pv list lock without using any more memory.
In the ever-important buildkernel benchmark on non-NUMA config, this
change provides 2x reduction of the system time.
</p>
<p>One complication is that old locking distribution scheme made a
natural fit for superpages promotion and demotion, since all embedded
small pages shared the same pv list lock, and the operations basically
fold/unfold corresponding pv entries.  Now the promotion and demotion
operations require taking all locks for constituent small pages, which
provides small but measurable impact on them.  It is possible to
optimize it further by providing the 'superlock' on the first page
from the superpage run, but the affected operations are relatively
rare so that it is not even obvious that implementing the optimization
would not slow down other pathes.
</p>
<p>Another important nuance of the pv entries handling is that sometimes
pv entries allocator must not fail.  Typically this is required when
kernel makes a call to pmap_enter() which must establish new mapping,
and for managed page this includes allocating the pv entry if existing
cannot be reused.  If allocator cannot get a fresh page from the
vm_page_alloc(9), it opts to destroy some other managed mapping to
either get a reusable pv entry from current pmap, or destroy enough
managed mappings from some other pmap to free whole page.
</p>
<p>To do the reclamation, currently all pages from which with pv entries
are allocated, are linked in the global pv chunk list, which is
protected by global (per-NUMA domain) mutex.  Any allocation or free
of pv entry has to lock the mutex, which is apparently a contention
point for large machines.
</p>
<p>Patch removes the global list of chunks, instead linking all pmaps in
the global list like it is done on i386 (but for different reason).
Now the global lock is only taken for pmap creation and free, which
corresponds to fork/exec and exit of a process, and when pv allocator
starts reclaiming from other pmaps (which is normally does not
happen).

	</p>
<p>The primary goal of this work is to bring scalable routing multipath implementation,  enabled by default. Another goal is enabling high-performance routing lookups.
</p>
<p>Multipath will close long-standing feature gap that modern networking OS must have.
Lockless routing lookups will remove lookup bottlenecks, improve both dataplane and control plane performance for the setups with large number of routes.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The initial routing kpi was introduced back in 1980. It was a nice generic approach back then, as no one knew how the protocols would evolve. It has been enormously successful as it was able to survive for 20+ years.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kpi does not try to protect subsystem internals from the outside users, resulting in tight coupling with other subsystems. As a result, making changes is hard, leading to compromises and piling technical debt.
</p>
<h3>Implementation overview</h3>

<p>Most changes are based on introduction of the concept of nexthops. Nexthops are separate datastructures, containing all necessary information to perform packet forwarding such as gateway, interface and mtu. They are shared among the routes, providing more pre-computed cache-efficient data while requiring less memory.
Interested reader can find more detailed description in <a href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/D24141" shape="rect">D24141</a>. Another overview can be found in Nexthop object <a href="https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/434/attachments/251/436/nexthop-objects-talk.pdf" shape="rect">talk</a> describing Linux implementation.
</p>
<p>Multipath implementation extends nexthop concept further by introducing nexthop groups.
</p>
<p>Each route has a pointer to either nexthops or a nexthop group, decoupling lookup algorithm from the routing stack internals. Both nexthops and nexthop groups are immutable and use epoch(9)-backed reclamation.
</p>
<p>A pre-requisite for lockless routing lookup is the introduction of modular lookup framework, allowing to attach any longest-prefix-match algorithm implementation to any IPv4/IPv6 fib.
</p>
<p>Currently there are plans to use modified DIR-24-8 algorithm from DPDK for both IPv4 and IPv6 families as an example of base lockless implementation.

	</p><p>Zstandard (ZSTD) is a modern high-performance compression
algorithm designed to provide the compression ratios of gzip

</p>
<p>Integrating ZSTD into ZFS will further extend the transparent

ZSTD offers compression levels ranging from 1 (low compression)

	</p><p>CheriBSD extends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and software
compartmentalization features supported by the CHERI instruction set
extensions.
</p>
<p>Support for CHERI-RISC-V in CheriBSD has continued to mature this
quarter in tandem with refinements to the CHERI-RISC-V architecture.
We have recently made CheriBSD's "pure capability" (CheriABI) process
environment the default ABI rather than a compatibility layer. It has
grown support for:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dynamically linked binaries (previously only statically-linked binaries were supported)
</p></li>
<li><p>C++ including exceptions
</p></li>
<li><p>sealed return address and function pointer capabilities ("sentries") which provide additional CFI protection
</p></li>
<li><p>initial MMU protections for loading and storing tags
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>At this point, CHERI-RISC-V support in CheriBSD is generally on par with
support for CHERI-MIPS.
</p>
<p>Much of this effort has been focused on preparing CheriBSD on
CHERI-RISC-V for inclusion as a demonstrator system in DARPA's Finding
Exploits to Thwart Tampering (<a href="https://fett.darpa.mil" shape="rect">FETT</a>) Bug Bounty
program.
</p>
<p>In addition, work has begun this quarter on porting CheriBSD to Arm's
Morello SoC.  Morello is a prototype demonstrator board which adds CHERI
extensions to ARMv8-A.
</p>
<p>We've recently switched to a dev-branch model where active work takes
place on the <code>dev</code> branch and we periodically merge to <code>master</code> with
synchronization between CheriBSD and dependencies like CHERI-LLVM.
</p>
<p>For those interested in what it's like to program for CHERI, we've
recently released a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf" shape="rect">CHERI C/C++ Programming

	</p><p>For quite a while the <a href="https://ci.FreeBSD.org" shape="rect">FreeBSD CI infrastructure</a>
has been running FreeBSD builds and regression tests, making it easy to
spot regressions.  While CI was building images for all architectures,
the regression tests were only run on amd64 and i386, which means they
couldn't detect architecture-specific runtime breakage on non-x86
architectures.  This poses a problem not only for FreeBSD itself,
but also for people working on FreeBSD forks for !x86, such as the CHERI
project at University of Cambridge and SRI International.
</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to run regression tests on the remaining
architectures supported by FreeBSD: ARM, ARM64, MIPS, POWER, and RISC-V.
The tests are being run using common, mostly machine-independent scripts.
Those required some changes to make it possible to use QEMU in addition
to Bhyve, the hypervisor used for x86 tests.  The <code>sysutils/u-boot-qemu-arm</code>
and <code>sysutils/u-boot-qemu-arm64</code> ports were added to the Ports Collection.
Finally, each of the architectures required some tweaks, to account for
different configuration requirements - for example the MIPS kernel
doesn't support VirtIO disks, or even AHCI, whereas on ARM64 the U-Boot
gets confused with more than one VirtIO disk.
</p>
<p>On ARM, we're currently at 52 failures and 590 skipped tests, of 5925
tests ran
(https://ci.freebsd.org/job/FreeBSD-head-armv7-test/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/).
On ARM64 it's 19 failures and 160 skipped
(https://ci.freebsd.org/job/FreeBSD-head-aarch64-test/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/).
On MIPS it's 172 failures and 734 skipped
(https://ci.freebsd.org/job/FreeBSD-head-mips64-test/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/).
For POWER, and RISC-V the results are not available yet.
</p>
<p>Remaining work:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Failing regression tests need to be fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The tests are quite slow on QEMU, for example the ARM64 run takes about
   five hours.  Running them automatically after each commit would quickly
   overload the CI cluster.  A solution would be to e.g. run them daily.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of the jobs still fail to produce results: powerpc64 deadlocks at
   the end of regression test suite due to an unkillable process, riscv64
   panics randomly, and on mips64 kyua(1) often crashes on jemalloc assertion.
   Those might be fixed by an upcoming QEMU port update.

<p>The <i>FreeBSD/RISC-V</i> project is providing support for running FreeBSD on the
<a href="https://riscv.org/" shape="rect">RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture</a>. Since RISC-V is still
a young and evolving platform, one of our goals is to have FreeBSD be a
well-supported option for users as RISC-V hardware increases in availability.
</p>
<p>This quarter saw a number of improvements to the boot process.
</p>
<p>The <code>physmem</code> interface used by arm and arm64 to enumerate physical memory
resources was moved to machine-independent code and adopted on RISC-V. As a
result, the kernel is now able to detect and exclude physical memory reserved by
devices or firmware. A bug that prevented the kernel from using physical memory
below its load address was fixed. This typically did not manifest in much waste,
as the kernel is loaded 2MB after the start of physical memory by default. In
future boot configurations, the impact would have been much larger.
</p>
<p>Our port for OpenSBI was updated to v0.8, bringing several new features and
fixes. In particular, it brought the Hardware State Management (HSM) extension,
which can be used to start and stop CPUs. FreeBSD will now use this extension
whenever it detects that it is available.
</p>
<p>There has also been a lot of work done to port FreeBSD's standard bootloader,
<code>loader(8)</code>, to RISC-V. This has big advantages in terms of boot flexibility,
and brings us closer to what's needed to produce official FreeBSD/RISC-V release
images. By leveraging UEFI support from
<a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/" shape="rect">u-boot</a>, <code>loader.efi</code> can be used in a manner
similar to arm and arm64. Next quarter will likely bring u-boot ports for RISC-V
targets, pending the v2020.07 release. Booting the kernel directly via SBI
firmware will continue to be supported.

An import into 12-STABLE is planned before the end of July, but it
will not be enabled by default (will require "WITH_GH_BC=yes" to
be set in /etc/src.conf).
</p>
<p>This version has been developed by Gavin D. Howard with the goal
to provide a highly portable and POSIX compatible implementation.
It offers GNU bc compatibility and should be a drop-in replacement
for the bc in FreeBSD, except for standard-violating behavior of
the bc currently in FreeBSD (e.g., the modulo operator).
</p>
<p>Additional features:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High performance (up to more than a factor of 100 faster than
  the current FreeBSD implementation in some tests)
</p></li>
<li><p>support of message catalogs with a large number of languages
  supported in the current release (contributions of further
  translations are welcome).
</p></li>
<li><p>Extra built-in functions and operators.
</p></li>
<li><p>Extended library of advanced math functions
</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed man-page explaining standard conformant and extended
  features
</p></li>
<li><p>One shared binary for bc and dc (bc is not just a pre-processor
  that relies on dc for the actual computations)
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The only dc feature not supported by the dc is the execution of
sub-processes, since the author considers it a security hazard
for a calculator to have.

licensed toolchain for quite some time.  In the last quarter we retired two
obsolete GNU bintuils: objdump, and as.
</p>
<p>Many uses of objdump can be replaced with readelf, and llvm-objdump is also
available in the base system.  Ports that depend on objdump have been updated
to rely on the GNU binutils port or package.
</p>
<p>The GNU as utility was used by both the base system and by ports.  As with objdump, ports
that require GNU as have generally been updated to depend on binutils.  One
file in the base system (skein_block_asm.s) proved troublesome during earlier
attempts to migrate to using Clang's integrated assembler (IAS).  However,
after the update to Clang 10 (and with some trivial modifications to the
source) IAS can assemble the file.
</p>
<p>Both GNU as and objdump have been removed from FreeBSD-CURRENT and will be

	Contact: Konstantin Belousov &lt;<a href="mailto:kib@FreeBSD.org">kib@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;
	</p><p>Rtld gets some number of small bug fixes and improvements.
</p>
<p>RTLD_DEEPBIND dlopen(3) flag was implemented, despite being a strange
and even unsafe idea, for compatibility with glibc.
</p>
<p>Several improvements to the direct execution mode were made.  Most
interesting are perhaps the '-v' switch to report some configuration
parameters for rtld, the ability to specify argv0 different from the
executed binary name, and fixes to properly set osrel/ABI for the
directly executed binary.
</p>
<p>The link_map structure that is used by tools that need to know the
list of loaded shared objects (like gdb and wine) was made more
compatible with glibc, while keeping existing FreeBSD ABI intact.
</p>
<p>In the course of the link_map work, it become apparent that rtld sometimes
needs to report presence of features that cannot be deduced by just a
runtime test for symbol presence or for function behavior.  For that,
a scheme of reporting features with uniformingly named symbols was
designed - see the rtld(1) man-page (in CURRENT) for an explanation.
</p>
<p>Position-independent (PIE) binaries on FreeBSD are now marked with the
DF_1_PIE DT_FLAG1 flag.  Otherwise, such binaries are just ET_DYN
objects and it is quite hard to distinguish proper dynamically shared
object (DSO) from PIE binary.  The problem is that for binaries, the static
linker strips some information which is required for proper loading as a
DSO, and additonally, binaries contains relocations like copy-relocations
that cannot be handled for non-main binaries at all.
</p>
<p>With the flag addition, rtld properly detects binaries and refuses to
load them with dlopen() or as DT_NEEDED dependency. ldd(1) also
misdetected PIE vs. DSO, and required a fix to parse dynamic segments
to not try to dlopen() them.

a PIM suite <a href="https://kontact.kde.org/" shape="rect">Kontact</a>
and hundreds of other applications that can be used on
any FreeBSD desktop machine.
</p>
<p>This quarter has been an ever-so-peculiar one. While we are used
to working remotely, collaborating over the internet to update the ports
tree, it's <i>qualitatively</i> different when
the whole world locks down. Meanwhile, software continues to be released,
so this quarter the kde@ team:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restored a patch that closes down a remote TCP held by X11 applications
  that use the ICE library. Thanks to Colin Percival for reporting it.
  It went missing in one of the port updates. To prevent this in the future,
  the patch has been upstreamed. PR 229772.
</p></li>
<li><p>Chased KDE-adjacent software like CMake, Cutelyst, Latte-dock and Nheko
  through new releases. In particular CMake takes a lot of effort every
  time because it is a build-time dependency of over 2000 ports.
</p></li>
<li><p>graphics/poppler was updated to the latest upstream release. This
  is a low-level dependency for many document-viewing applications,
  and like CMake requires chasing a lot of other software.
  Poppler is one of the components shared between various
  software stacks (and "desktop environments") under the desktop@
  group, in which kde@ participates.
</p></li>
<li><p>KDE Frameworks release like clockwork, reaching KDE Frameworks 5.70 mid-may.
</p></li>
<li><p>KDE Applications -- the KDE release service, really, which delivers
  libraries, applications, and add-ons -- had one large release,
  with <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelog-releases.php?version=20.04.1" shape="rect">20.04.1</a>
  landing in the ports tree also mid-may and its monthly update
  20.04.2 in mid-june.
</p></li>
<li><p>Some new Wayland support for KDE Plasma -- we have not tested this on FreeBSD --
  has appeared and has been duly packaged.
</p></li>
<li><p>A great deal of preparation has gone into Qt 5.15. Many ports have been
  pre-emptively patched for this new -- and last -- LTS release of Qt 5.
  The update itself has not yet landed, pending a few last bits of fallout.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The kde@ team would like to thank Antoine for many exp-runs, mikael@ for useful tips,
swills@ for patience and kai@ for dealing with WebEngine.
</p>
<p>The next big round of updates for the KDE stack is slated:
CMake 3.18, Qt 5.15 LTS, and KDE Frameworks 5.71.

	</p><p>Haskell is a general-purpose strictly-typed pure functional language.
The Haskell on FreeBSD projects strives to provide the up-to-date
Haskell toolchain as well as various application written in this language.
</p>
<p>This quarter brought the long-awaited GHC update, which is now at
version 8.8.3. Along the compiler, the Haskell build system frontend,
cabal-install, was also upgraded to 3.0.2.0. During this update, numerous
Haskell ports were updated too.
</p>
<p>All existing ports of Haskell applications were migrated to USES=cabal,
which implements Go-style build proccess - all dependencies are compiled as
part of the build. As a consequence, ports for Haskell libraries have been
deprecated and removed.
</p>
<p>Upgrading GHC became a tedious task for a single person, so a new GitHub
repository was created under the FreeBSD organization -
<a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports-haskell" shape="rect">freebsd-ports-haskell</a>.
Right now, work is being done on preparing another GHC upgrade in the <code>ghc-upgrade-810</code>
branch. Any contributions are welcome.

<p>FreshPorts, and its sister site, FreshSource, have reported
upon FreeBSD commits for 20 years. They cover all commits,
not just ports.
</p>
<p>FreshPorts tracks the commits and extracts data from the
port Makefiles to create a database of information useful
to both port developers and port users.
</p>
<p>For example, https://www.freshports.org/security/acme.sh/ shows
the history of this port, back to its creation in May 2017.
</p>
<h3>git</h3>

<p>Work on git started <a href="https://news.freshports.org/?s=git&amp;searchsubmit=" shape="rect">back in September</a>.
It was ignored for a while and started back in mid-June with
the creation of new git-specific jails for commit ingress (commit
processing gitdev) and for the website.
</p>
<p>Serhii (Sergey) Kozlov <a href="https://github.com/FreshPorts/git_proc_commit/blob/master/git-to-freshports/git-to-freshports.py" shape="rect">created a script</a>
to transform GIT commit entries into XML digestible by FreshPorts.
This was a huge step foward for the effort.
</p>
<p>The next step include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incorporate a that script the automated processes of FreshPorts
</p></li>
<li><p>migrate to new test &amp; stage versions of FreshPorts
</p></li>
<li><p>test
</p></li>
<li><p>get ready for prod

<h4>Help wanted</h4>

<p>git is not far away now. I could use helpers to
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>review code
</p></li>
<li><p>watch the commits on the devgit websites
</p></li>
<li><p>catch missing stuff
</p>
</li></ul>
Thank you

<h3>Packages</h3>

<p>FreshPorts now displays the packages version available from the
repo sources. This covers all primary tiers (e.g. FreeBSD:12:amd64)
and all secondary tiers (e.g. FreeBSD:13:powerpc64). This helps
uses know what versions they can expect and when then repo was last
built.
</p>
<h3>Dependency lines</h3>

<p>Some things are easiest done via copy/paste. If you are working on a port
Makefile and need to add a new dependency, FreshPorts shows the dependency
line for that port.  For example:
</p>
<p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code>
acme.sh&gt;0:security/acme.sh
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Libraries are also covered by this feature.
</p>
<p>Python ports were recently adjusted to display
</p>
<p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code>
 ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}virtualenv&gt;0:devel/py-virtualenv
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>instead of
</p>
<p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code>
py37-virtualenv&gt;0:devel/py-virtualenv
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>You can read more about this change in [issue
#73](https://github.com/FreshPorts/freshports/issues/73).
</p>

<h3>Watch ports I maintain</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.freshports.org/search.php" shape="rect">search page</a> has long had
the "Ports I Maintain" button (if you are logged in). This feature recently
branched out to a new automated watch list option: <code>Watch ports I maintain</code>.
</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.freshports.org/report-subscriptions.php" shape="rect">report subscription</a>
will notify you of any commits to the ports you maintain. Your email
address on FreshPorts must match the value in the MAINTAINER field of the port.
This is always a daily report.
</p>
<p>From time to time, an infrastructure change will occur which touches your
port. This feature ensures you know about that change.
</p>
<h3>Repology links</h3>

<p>Repology links were requested. This allows you to see what versions of that
port are in the repositories of other systems. A link to repology.org
appears on every port page.
</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>

<p>Based upon <a href="https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/03/things-you-didnt-know-freshports-can-do/" shape="rect">things you didn&#8217;t know FreshPorts can do</a>
</p>

<p>There are many things FreshPorts can do, including search Makefile's and
<code>pkg-plist</code>. This is from a recent blog post:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>provides example dependency line. e.g. p5-XML-RSS&gt;0:textproc/p5-XML-RSS
</p></li>
<li><p>list of dependencies for a port
</p></li>
<li><p>list of ports depending upon this port
</p></li>
<li><p>see default configuration options
</p></li>
<li><p>what packages install a given file (e.g. bin/unzip)
</p></li>
<li><p>find out what ports a person maintains
</p></li>
<li><p>find Makefiles which contain references to bunzip
</p></li>
<li><p>search results can be plain-text consisting of a list of foo/bar ports
</p></li>
<li><p>the Maximum Effort checkbox on the search page does nothing
</p></li>
<li><p>committers can be notified of sanity test failures after the commit
</p></li>
<li><p>find a commit, any commit, based on SVN revision number, e.g. : https://www.freshports.org/commit.php?revision=352332
</p>

</li></ul>
<h3>Javascript help wanted</h3>

<p>bhyve(8) is a hypervisor that supports running a variety of guest
operating systems in virtual machines. bhyve(8) includes support for PCI
devices passthru, a technique to pass host PCI devices to a virtual
machine for its exclusive control and use.
</p>
<p>For some years, PCI passthrough (ppt) in bhyve was not working on some
Intel systems and for OpenBSD guests due to two bugs. The first one was
crashing FreeBSD host when bhyve was started with ppt on Intel
processors with two VT-d translation units (IOMMU), included in most
Skylake and newer Intel processors.
</p>
<p>The second bug was preventing correct interrupts handling for OpenBSD
guests. As a result, OpenBSD guests running on bhyve were not able to
use any PCI devices passed through to them from the host.
</p>
<p>During the last 2 months the second bug was identified and fixed and
they both were backported to 12.1-RELEASE (p7). So now it's possible to
fully take advantage of PCI passthrough (ppt) with bhyve in a
production-ready RELEASE version.
</p>
<p>The most typical case for ppt is to pass to the guest network adapters
for its complete control, but you can also pass through USB devices
(including external HDDs). Note though, passthrough of VGA and GPU
devices is not supported yet (for more details see the 3rd link).
</p>
<p>A particularly interesting case for ppt is to use OpenBSD guest as a
firewall and a router for a FreeBSD server.
</p>
<p>With ppt you can achieve this all inside a single server. You could pass
to the OpenBSD guest a network adapter connected to the internet and it
would take a complete control of it. After filtering the traffic, it
could pass good packets via virtual network interfaces to other guests
or to the host.
</p>
<p>Once a network adapter is passed through, a FreeBSD host not only
doesn't see it and hence doesn't handle the network traffic, it doesn't
even have to initialize the adapter (e.g. in case of a WiFi card, it's
the guest that loads the firmware).
</p>
<p>In simple terms the host only passes the device interrupts to the guest
as they come from the hardware. Everything related to the device
management happens inside the guest so there's no danger that some
network traffic exploits some issue in the host's network stack and
causes the host to crash or misbehave in other ways.

	</p><p>SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed
under the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more.
Thanks to SageMath it is possible to access their combined power through a
common, Python-based language or directly via interfaces or wrappers.
</p>
<p>The goal is creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab.
</p>
<p>This is a complex port, with a lot of dependencies, and it has been
broken for some time. Upstream is working on easing its packaging, and
many previously bundled applications can now be replaced by external
packages.
</p>
<p>If you are interested, it would be nice to create a team of maintainers
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to maintain some of the dependencies;
</p></li>
<li><p>to maintain SageMath itself and prepare the next release (9.2 is coming!).

	</p><p>chaifi is a TUI (text UI) utility aimed at simplifying the process of joining
public WiFi networks in places like coffee shops or libraries. It replaces the
process of scanning and manually editing wpa_supplicant.conf with an
interactive dialog. The utility is in no way a replacement for full-featured
network managers in major desktop environments. Still, if you're working from a
console or using a tiling window manager, it may save you some seconds (or in
worst case minutes) of your time.

sound system. It can show the current Sound Driver configuration and select an
audio device: to get its information, to change the volume or to set it as
default, the last feature allows to switch easily audio from/to laptop and hdmi,
headphones and speakers, and so on.<br clear="none" />
MixerTUI can be installed via the audio/mixertui port.

	</p><p>pot is a jail management tool that <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03.html#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver" shape="rect">also supports orchestration through nomad</a>.
</p>
<p>Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: A repository of pot flavours and complete images for usage with pot.
</p>
<p>This should simplify setting up complex software with many packages and ports in comparison to manual configuration: Potluck aims to provide a content library as an additional layer of abstraction, on top of existing infrastructure like pkg, that pot has to offer.
</p>
<p>Pot "flavour" files are provided on [Github]((https://github.com/hny-gd/potluck)) and fed into a Jenkins instance. On the <a href="https://potluck.honeyguide.net/" shape="rect">Potluck Repository</a>, for each flavour, detailed descriptions as well as ready-made images to be imported by pot are provided.
</p>
<p>The initial project has been set up, and three simple flavours, along with <a href="https://potluck.honeyguide.net/blog/jitsi-meet-nomad/" shape="rect">a complete Jitsi Meet instance in a jail</a> has been created as a Proof of Concept that should allow running a fully-fledged video conference system with just a few easy commands within a few minutes.
</p>
<p>As only the initial versions have been set up and implemented so far, general feedback, tests, as well as additional, useful flavours are very welcome!

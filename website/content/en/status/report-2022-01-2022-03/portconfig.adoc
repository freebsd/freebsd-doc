FreeBSD provides the Ports Collection to give users and administrators a simple way to install applications.
It is possible to configure a port before the building and installation.
PortConfig is an utility for setting the port options via a Text User Interface.

As each terminal has different properties PortConfig can be customized via environment variables to set up the User Interface, for example: menu size, theme, borders, and so on; each feature is documented inside the manual.
Further, if a port has a specific 'pkg-help' file, PortConfig will show a Help button to open a "popup" with help information.

FreeBSD provides thousands of ports therefore it is not feasible to test PortConfig for each use; please report any problem.

Alfonso would like to thank Baptiste Daroussin for the port, suggestions, help, and testing for this utility and its library.

Over the past several months, I've started putting together tools and resources to help make the FreeBSD ecosystem (more) accessible to people with disabilities:

* a link:https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-accessibility[mailing list]
* a link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Accessibility[set of wiki pages] including link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Accessibility/Resources[resources] and a link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Accessibility/Wishlist[categorized wish list]
* tooling including a link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?keywords=accessibility&list_id=471790&resolution=---[searchable accessibility Bugzilla keyword] and an link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/project/profile/87/[accessibility Phabricator group]

I need all the help I can get with:

* specifying, designing, implementing, and testing the items on the wishlist
* adding to the wishlist in areas were have little or no experience or for things I missed
* moving beyond software and documentation to processes and culture

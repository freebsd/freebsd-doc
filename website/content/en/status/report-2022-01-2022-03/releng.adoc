The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the first quarter of 2022, the Release Engineering Team completed work on, and submitted to the developers the 13.1-RELEASE schedule.  This will be the second point release from the stable/13 branch.
As of this writing, three BETA builds have been run, with at least two RC builds before the final release, currently scheduled for April 21, 2022.

We look forward to another consistently stable release at the end of this cycle, as well as many more to come for other branches moving forward.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds were released for the *main*, *stable/13*, and *stable/12* branches.

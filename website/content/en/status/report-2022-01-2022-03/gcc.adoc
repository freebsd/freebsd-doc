After about two decades of maintaining FreeBSD's lang/gcc* ports, the time came to hand over the baton and mostly step back.
Alas the baton essentially dropped to the floor, despite multiple calls for help.

Here are a few specific tasks looking for help:

 * Upgrade GCC_DEFAULT in Mk/bsd.default-versions.mk from 10 to 11,
   including fixing the (luckily minor) fall out of an -exp run:

 * Three changes to work through with upstream GCC (requires src
   expertise, not ports):

     ** upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-gets-no-more
     ** upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-arm-unwind-cxx-support
     ** link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256874[https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256874]

 * We have removed the unmaintained lang/gcc9-devel and lang/gcc10-devel
   ports, alas kept lang/gcc11-devel and lang/gcc12-devel which would be
   good to see if not weekly, then somewhat regular updates.

The FreeBSD Office team works on a number of office-related software suites and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

Work during this quarter was focused on providing the latest stable release of LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

During the 2022Q1 period we pushed maintenance patches for the LibreOffice 7.2 port to the quarterly branch and brought the latest, 7.3, releases and all companion libraries such as MDDS, libIxion and more to the ports tree.

Also we are still working on the link:https://github.com/fluffykhv/freebsd-ports-boost[Boost WIP repository] to bring the latest Boost library to the ports.

We are looking for people to help with the open tasks:

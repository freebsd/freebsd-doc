The Pantheon desktop environment is designed for elementary OS.
It builds on GNOME technologies (such as Mutter, GTK 3 and 4) and it is written in Vala.
The goal is to have a new desktop for users.

*13.1-RELEASE or higher is required*, because several core components depend on package:deskutils/xdg-desktop-portal[].

The repository contains Mk/Uses framework `elementary.mk`, official applications, and curated ports which depend on package:x11-toolkits/granite[].

Since the previous report, we have been updating its related ports, especially:

* package:deskutils/elementary-calendar[] https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267797[update to 6.1.2]
* package:deskutils/iconbrowser[]
* package:graphics/elementary-photos[]
* package:math/elementary-calculator[]
* package:multimedia/elementary-videos[]
* package:x11/elementary-terminal[]
* package:x11-themes/gnome-icons-elementary[]
* package:x11-toolkits/granite7[].

Power manager plugins for top panel (wingpanel) and control center (switchboard) are finished.

A new switchboard plugin is also available, package:net/switchboard-plug-sharing[].
Ported *Rygel*, GNOME UPnP/DLNA services.

Submitted other patches for low level libraries such as:

* package:print/cups-pk-helper[] https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=266067[update to 0.2.7] required by package:print/switchboard-plus-printers[]
* package:devel/libgee[] https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=266585[update to 0.20.6] heavily used by the desktop
* package:sysutils/polkit[] update to 122 (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37137[D37137])
* package:sysutils/accountsservice[] update to 22.08.8 (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37679[D37679]).

==== Open tasks

* Improve documentation.
* Continue to work on user settings.

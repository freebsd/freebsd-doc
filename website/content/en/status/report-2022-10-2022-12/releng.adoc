The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among other things.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Release Engineering Team completed work on the 12.4-RELEASE cycle.
This is the final release from the stable/12 branch.
During the release cycle, only one BETA build and two RC (release candidate) builds were needed; overall the release cycle went very smoothly and the release took place on December 5th.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Release Engineering Team continued providing weekly development snapshot builds for the *main*, *stable/13*, and *stable/12* branches.

In the first quarter of 2023, the Release Engineering Team will start work on the upcoming 13.2-RELEASE.

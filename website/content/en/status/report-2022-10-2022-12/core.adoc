==== Items

===== Core Team Charter

A delegation of the current core team is working together with some members of the previous Core Team to draft a core team charter.
There was a face-to-face meeting in the US on December 3 - 4 to discuss the new charter.
The delegation will present to the rest of the core team and discuss the details in the first quarter of 2023.
The same delegation also had a meeting with the FreeBSD Foundation board on December 5th to discuss the collaboration details.

===== Experimental Matrix IM solution

The core team is working on evaluating Matrix as an instant messaging tool for the project.
This will make the project's communication channels less dependant on third parties.
The service will be made available to the FreeBSD community to test and evaluate its validity at a later date.

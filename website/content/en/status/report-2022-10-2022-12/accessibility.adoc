This project aims at providing a very basic screen reader usable in console mode (without a GUI) for FreeBSD.
This is an important first step for system administrators using speech to access computers, who previously would have needed a second computer running a terminal emulator to install or configure a FreeBSD server or character-based desktop computer.

The third and fourth quarters of 2022 saw basic design and some feature testing which looks promising, and a link:https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-accessibility/2022-October/000014.html[detailed call for testing with installation procedure] posted.

This project needs help with the following:

* Code reviewing
* Usability testing
* Integrating with the FreeBSD installer.

Sponsor: NVIDIA Networking (for the kernel development part)

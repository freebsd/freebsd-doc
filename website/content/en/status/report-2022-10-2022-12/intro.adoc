The New Year has started and here is the last status report of 2022, including 34 reports.
You will also notice that for the first time a new category has been introduced: the Cloud category.
As FreeBSD keeps up to date with the latest technologies in IT, projects dealing with the cloud make steady improvements, and thus it has been judged that they deserve their own category in the status reports.

The new category is not the only change about status reports.
Indeed, the status team is revisiting its own workflow to become more efficient.
If you are a report submitter, please ensure to read carefully the report authored by the status team as well as the next Call for Reports emails to keep up with the most recent changes.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the status team.

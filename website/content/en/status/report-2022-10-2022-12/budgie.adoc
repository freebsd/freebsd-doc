Budgie initially developed as the default desktop environment for the former Evolve OS.
Since the 10.6.x releases, improvements have been made to be "agnostic".

It is built on top of GNOME technologies such as GTK >= 3, GLib, Mutter, libpeas.

The goal is to have a new desktop for end users.
I have submitted 2 reviews (link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37224[D37224] and link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37286[D37286] for The FreeBSD Porter's Handbook) so committers can import it.

These reviews include:

* Mk/Uses framework `budgie.mk`
* new virtual category (*budgie*)
* 6 applications
* icon theme `x11-themes/tela-icon-theme`.

During this quarter, I have also submitted several patches (related to this desktop) especially:

* `x11/gnome-terminal` update to 3.44.2 link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267928[bug #267928]
* `x11-wm/mutter` update to 42.6 link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267899[bug #267899]
* `x11-toolkits/libwnck3` update to 40.1 link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267898[bug #267898].

These bugs are also still open:

* `devel/libpeas` link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267420[bug #267420]
* `sysutils/gnome-settings-daemon` link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=265107[bug #265107].

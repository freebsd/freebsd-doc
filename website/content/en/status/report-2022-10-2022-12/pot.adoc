Pot is a jail management tool that link:https://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2020-01-2020-03/#pot-and-the-nomad-pot-driver[also supports orchestration through Nomad].

During the last quarter, link:https://github.com/bsdpot/pot/releases/tag/0.15.4[pot 0.15.4] was released.
It again contains a number of improvements like signing pot images as well as many bug fixes.
Also, we welcome two new pot contributors: link:https://github.com/zilti[@zilti] and link:https://github.com/reezer[@reezer].

Additionally, there is a new link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/zilti/pot[Ansible pot collection] available.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

As you can see, we link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/commits/master[had a busy quarter again], this time including improvements to the link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/nextcloud-nginx-nomad[Nextcloud] as well as link:https://github.com/bsdpot/potluck/tree/master/jitsi-meet[Jitsi] images.

Furthermore, we landed pot-based FreeBSD support for sccache-dist server (the server component for distributed compilation of rust and C++ using sccache) and it will be part of the upcoming sccache 0.4.0, see link:https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/pull/1184[mozilla/sccache#1184].
Once released, this will become available through devel/sccache.

This means one can build rust projects on FreeBSD targeting a cluster of machines, something that could potentially be integrated into poudriere as well.

Last but not least, link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0IB0mc2KTE[Luca's EuroBSDCon 2022 talk] is now available on YouTube.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.

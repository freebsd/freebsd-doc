==== Goals of the new workflow

This quarter the status team has been discussing with doceng@ some improvements to its workflow.
In particular, the team is attempting to merge its GitHub repository into the FreeBSD doc/ repository.

Here are the reasons for such a change:

* having two independent repositories requires spending some time to make sure that both are in sync, which is being done manually.
See for example commits such as link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly/commit/4b8255e604dd0513e841aa8f3dce7741e78b999c[https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly/commit/4b8255e604dd0513e841aa8f3dce7741e78b999c], which are not immediately clear in their commit messages about what is being done unless more time is invested to copy commit messages properly;

* the FreeBSD doc/ repository is self-hosted, while the status repository is hosted on GitHub.
Since the contents of the self-hosted repository are mirrored, nothing is being lost in visibility with the repository merging.

Some inconsistencies about the name of the team have also been found: the team has been referred to as "quarterly", "quarterly status team", "status", "status team", "monthly" etc.
So this issue is also being addressed.

Please note that we are still working on these changes and that they might not be completed within the next quarter.
The status team will take care to keep all information about report submissions up to date so that you always know how to submit your reports.

==== Team naming

Since "quarterly" might refer to quarterly reports but also to quarterly branches, using "quarterly" only could cause some confusion in some contexts.
"quarterly-status" is likely a bad idea as well, as the frequency of reports publication might need to change in the future.
Thus just "status" has been chosen: this is correct as quarterly status reports contain information about the status of the development of FreeBSD, it is frequency-agnostic and consistent with link:https://www.freebsd.org/status/[its FreeBSD website section].

The following link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267813[email addresses have been created]:

* the main contact address for the status team is now <status@FreeBSD.org>.
Mails sent to `quarterly@FreeBSD.org` will still reach the team, but you are encouraged to use the new address;
* the email address for the status report submissions is now <status-submissions@FreeBSD.org>.
Mails sent to `quarterly-submissions@FreeBSD.org` will still reach the team, but you are encouraged to use the new address;
* the `quarterly-calls` mailing list has been renamed to link:https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-status-calls[status-calls].
If you were already subscribed to `quarterly-calls`, you do not need to resubscribe.

==== Report submission

Three different ways to submit reports will be provided:

* submitting a review on Phabricator.
A new link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/project/profile/88/[Phabricator group] called "status" link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267812[has been created].
If you would like to give a hand to the team by reviewing reports we suggest you add yourself to the group 'watchers';

* submitting a pull request at link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/pulls[https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/pulls];

* sending an email to `status-submissions@FreeBSD.org`.

Reviewing processes will proceed as they usually do on each of these channels.

==== Other changes

* The repository merging will require reworking some of the existing tools to better integrate with the existent structure of the FreeBSD doc/ repository.

* The link:https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly[status reports GitHub repository] will be archived once the new workflow implementation is completed.

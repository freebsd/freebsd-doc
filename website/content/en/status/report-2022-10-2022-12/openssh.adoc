OpenSSH, a suite of remote login and file transfer tools, was updated from version 9.0p1 to 9.1p1 in the FreeBSD base system.

It has been merged to the stable branches, is available in FreeBSD 12.4, and will be in the upcoming FreeBSD 13.2.

A number of bug fixes and minor improvements have been submitted upstream to OpenSSH, and this process will continue with subsequent updates.

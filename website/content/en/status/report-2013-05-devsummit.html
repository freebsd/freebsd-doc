      <p>Buildworld is the target for building the base system in the
	venerable FreeBSD build system.  This session aimed to investigate
	the current limitations, discuss recent improvements, and
	propose future directions for this process.</p>

      <p>Over recent years, FreeBSD has been used increasingly in embedded
	systems and so cross development has become a lot more
	important.  One of the changes recently committed by Brooks
	Davis now permits building the entire base system and creating a
	disk image without root privileges.  This makes embedded
	development easier, as a number of users can now share an
	expensive development box, capable of performing builds
	quickly, without having to give all of them root.</p>

      <p>This session also discussed the bmake import, which brings in
	NetBSD's make along with some improvements from Juniper, which
	should allow much more accurate dependency tracking and faster
	parallel and incremental builds.  This should have some
	additional benefits to the rest of the project, for example by
	making our tinderbox infrastructure, which notifies developers if
	the have broken the build, able to report failures much more
	quickly.</p>

      <p>One frequently requested capability, which is now being
	investigated by Marcel Moolenar, is the ability to build FreeBSD
	from other platforms.  Currently, developing a FreeBSD-based
	embedded system requires a FreeBSD host system for building, which
	is a barrier to entry that we would like to avoid.</p>

      <p>There are a number of changes to our toolchain planned for the
	10.x and 11.x timescales, including replacing GNU binutils with
	LLVM-based tools and importing MCLinker.  These are unlikely to
	be the default in 10.0, but we hope to be able to provide a
	GPL-free base system as a functional option this year.</p>

      <p>The documentation working group met during the main sessions
	and also had several productive evenings improving the state of
	FreeBSD documentation.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Handbook has undergone some significant updates
	recently and there is work underway to create a snapshot that
	will be available as a professionally published print edition.
	There are still some sections in need of updates before this can
	happen and the documentation team is working on engaging the
	relevant developers to review this content.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD web site redesign was discussed.  Currently, many of
	the most commonly accessed pages are difficult to navigate to.
	Its visual design is also somewhat dated.  The documentation
	team is working to design an improved structure and has several
	offers of assistance with the appearance.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Project is international and many of the contributors
	do not have English as their first language.  To encourage more
	participation from the rest of the world, it is important to
	have high-quality translations of the documentation.  PC-BSD
	uses pootle (available from the FreeBSD ports tree) to assist with
	keeping translations consistent and up to date and we are
	evaluating doing the same for FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD has traditionally been a platform with support for very
	high performance networking.  This is one of the main reasons
	why it was selected for the Netflix streaming appliance, which
	is currently responsible for over 20% of the Internet traffic in
	the USA.  The goal of this session was to discuss current
	bottlenecks at the receiving end of connections.</p>

      <p>Modern network cards support multiple receive queues and can
	deliver packets into them depending on various criteria.  The
	design of a good API for accessing this functionality is very
	important, as it shortens the path between a packet arriving in
	the card and it being delivered into a userspace process.  In an
	extreme case, for example with cluster applications or virtual
	machines, the receive queue may be accessed directly from a
	process bypassing the kernel.  In a more conventional setting,
	the packets should be delivered to a kernel thread on the same
	CPU as the receiving process, so that the copy to userspace is
	cheap.</p>

      <p>The group examined a number of different proposals, including
	some patches, and discussed the requirements for a general API.
	This work is ongoing.</p>

      <p>The working group on ports and packages discussed the fallout
	from the security incident and the lessons learned.  Old-style
	binary package building is now online and the infrastructure for
	building them is in a much more maintainable state.  Building
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> (new-style) packages should be possible
	soon.</p>

      <p>Bryan Drewery presented a short talk on the status of
	Poudriere, the new package builder.  This is usable for building
	package sets for local deployment and for the official FreeBSD
	packages.  When the original package building infrastructure was
	designed, it took most of a day to build a large port like
	Mozilla on a high-end machine.  Now, we have single machines in
	the FreeBSD cluster that can build the entire ports tree in a day.
	Poudriere is designed for this model and does not rely on ports
	supporting parallel builds internally.  Instead, it builds each
	port in a separate jail, with ports that do not depend on each
	other being built in parallel when there are spare CPUs.</p>

      <p>Moving forward, the project plans to decouple package releases
	from base system releases.  Each base system release is intended
	to be backwards compatible within that release series and so any
	packages for N.x should work on N.x+1.  The project will build
	weekly package sets for each branch that will be retained for
	two weeks, with no QA, and monthly sets that will undergo QA and
	will be available for 12 months.</p>

      <p>Stacy Son and Brooks Davis talked about packages for less
	common architectures.  Stacy has worked to bring QEMU usermode
	support to FreeBSD.  This means that MIPS or ARM FreeBSD binaries can
	run on an x86 FreeBSD system.  The kernel will detect the foreign
	binary and launch it in the emulator.  Stacy has been using this
	to create jails containing a cross compiler and shell for the
	host architecture, but native libraries for the target.  This
	allows ports that are not cross-build aware to run configure
	scripts that do things like compile executables and run them,
	but still has the most processor-intensive part of the build
	(compiling and linking) running outside of emulation.  With this
	approach, we are easily able to build weekly package sets for
	MIPS and ARM on a single x86 box.  For installing onto embedded
	systems, there are still some open problems.  The
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> infrastructure can install many packages onto a
	disk image, but will not be able to run complex post-install
	scripts without the target system booting.</p>

      <p>UEFI is the new boot firmware standard pushed by Intel.  It
	comes with a number of challenges, including the SecureBoot
	restriction, that prevents the firmware from booting unsigned
	kernels and bootloaders.  This is not currently a problem, as
	most systems either do not enable this restriction by default,
	or make it easy to disable, but it will be more important in the
	future.</p>

      <p>The goal for UEFI support in FreeBSD is to merge the bootloader
	that is currently in the projects branch, which will perform
	signature verification and then hand off to the more
	conventional FreeBSD bootloader.  This loader will be very simple
	and so will need changing (and re-signing) fairly infrequently.
	The FreeBSD Foundation will be responsible for ensuring that the
	bootloader is signed and so will work with SecureBoot.</p>

      <p>There are a number of restructuring and refactoring tasks that
	will need to be done over the next few months to ensure that the
	FreeBSD boot process works cleanly with UEFI.  These include
	removing some code duplication between various platforms that
	use UEFI, removing some legacy support from the i386 kernel, and
	restructuring how some of the bootloader code is built.
	Interaction with UEFI will be simplified once clang supports the
	MS Windows calling convention (used by UEFI) when generating
	UNIX binaries.  Benno Rice has been working on this, with some
	assistence from David Chisnall, and this support should appear
	soon.</p>

      <p>Virtualization is an increasingly important topic, with large
	providers like Amazon deploying huge numbers of VMs and many
	users deploying VMs on desktop systems for testing and backwards
	compatibility.  Today, FreeBSD supports a wide variety of
	virtualization options.  This working group discussed the
	current status and future directions of several of them.</p>

      <p>Xen is the de-facto standard for large-scale virtualization and
	FreeBSD has supported running as a guest for some time.
	SpectraLogic has funded recent work on improving this, with two
	overlapping goals.  The first is to allow FreeBSD to run as the
	Domain 0 operating system.  This is the operating system that
	runs with elevated privilege and is allowed to talk directly to
	the hardware and which must provide the virtualized devices to
	the guests.  This requires full paravirtualization support.
	Related to this is the ability to use more paravirtualized
	hardware when booting as a hardware virtualized guest.  This
	includes support for the new PVH mode, which uses hardware
	support for memory operations but paravirtualized drivers for
	everything else, giving the best performance possible with
	Xen.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD VirtualBox port is progressing well, with preliminary
	support for 3D accleration in guests.  The patches for
	Microsoft's HyperV, provided by Microsoft, are currently being
	tested with a view to incorporating them into FreeBSD 10.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD also includes its own virtualization infrastructure, bhyve
	(pronounced beehive), which is designed to support
	hardware-assisted virtualization.  This has made significant
	progress over the past year, including now supporting AMD's
	virtualization extensions as well as those from Intel.  With so
	many options, FreeBSD is now very well placed in terms of
	virtualization, both as a host and a guest.</p>

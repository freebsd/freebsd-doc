Syzkaller is an operating system kernel fuzzer that can look for vulnerabilities in the kernel.

This project aims to improve the support of Syzkaller on FreeBSD.
Based on the existing WiFi fuzzer designed for Linux, we drafted a WiFi fuzzer for FreeBSD.
We planned to use man:wtap[4], a virtual wifi driver for testing, in order to support WiFi fuzzing.

Some of the design details include:

* Introduce a new netlink command to wtap in order to realize frame injection, which is essential for WiFi fuzzing.
* Initialize wtap devices in Syzkaller before WiFi fuzzing.

We are developing some prototypes and discussing the feasible design plan with some experts.
There is not much progress yet.
We hope to have more progress on this project in the next few months.

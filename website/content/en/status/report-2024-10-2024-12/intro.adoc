Here is the fourth and last 2024 status report, with 44 entries.

It shows: 2024 has been a tremendously successful and busy year.
Usually, one would expect the final months in a year to be less busy, with people leaving for holidays and New Years celebration.
We still managed to deliver and see great progress on so many things!

Collecting and compiling this report took longer than planned, but it was worth the wait.

Thank you to the whole community for your amazing work and an especially big thanks to those who contributed updates to this report!

Enjoy the read!

Chris Moerz, on behalf of the Status Team.

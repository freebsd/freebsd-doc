The OpenStack on FreeBSD project aims to merge the capabilities of the OpenStack cloud infrastructure with the robust features of FreeBSD.
Our objective is to harness FreeBSD's unique features while ensuring compatibility with OpenStack's operations.

In the fourth quarter, our primary goal was to finalize the tasks promised under milestone 1 by establishing a new environment for a demonstrable Proof of Concept (POC) site.
However, the simultaneous aim to set up another deployment based on FreeBSD Jail within the same environment led us to spend considerable time on network design and tuning.
Fortunately, we successfully established external network connectivity for guest VMs by the end of this period.
The remaining challenge now is to enable guest VMs to automatically acquire IP addresses through cloud-init.

On another note, we attempted to obtain the domain XML of VMs from the Linux-based OpenStack to compare with the XML used for bhyve VMs.
These domain XMLs are utilized by Libvirt, defining each virtual machine's configuration and operational parameters.
Comparing the differences between the two will aid in developing the "bhyve serial console over TCP" work.

In the first quarter of the upcoming year, we will continue to conclude the tasks related to milestone 1 of our project.
Additionally, we will persist in developing FreeBSD Ports for OpenStack components, further integrating and enhancing the systemâ€™s capabilities.

This work is to create FreeBSD UVC (USB Video Class) kernel driver and follow v4l2 APIs, so that most of the Linux camera applications can be easily ported to FreeBSD.

The code is still cleaning up and will be submitted to official review system after completing.

The Dell ThinOS team is currently working on MIPI Webcam support, including intel XPU.

The aim of this project is to improve support for Java in FreeBSD, by working with the upstream OpenJDK community, as well as the FreeBSD community in getting the changes and additions needed for fully supporting FreeBSD accepted upstream.

As this is a new project, there is not much to report yet, but here's what has been achieved so far:

* The Java Test Regression harness (jtreg) now link:https://github.com/snake66/jtreg/tree/freebsd-port[builds and runs] on FreeBSD, and the process of link:https://github.com/openjdk/jtreg/pull/237[upstreaming the changes] has started.

* OpenJDK 23 builds and runs on FreeBSD, and work on adding it to the ports collection has started; this is still considered experimental. link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48194[]

* Work on porting the next OpenJDK (version 24) has started. link:https://github.com/snake66/jdk/tree/jdk24-freebsd[]

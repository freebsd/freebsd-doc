LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt technologies.
It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and an intuitive interface.
Unlike most desktop environments, LXQt also works fine with less powerful machines.

During this quarter, the package:x11-wm/lxqt[] metaport was updated to 2.1.0.
This update adds initial link:https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/ConfigWaylandSettings/[Wayland support] to the LXQt desktop.
You can link:https://lxqt-project.org/release/2024/11/05/release-lxqt-2-1-0/[read some release highlights here].

Anyone interested in helping with the project is welcome.

Current version: 2.1.0

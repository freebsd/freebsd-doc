=== New srcmgr team

Contact: srcmgr <srcmgr@FreeBSD.org>

A new link:https://www.freebsd.org/administration/#t-srcmgr[source management team] has been ratified by core@ to handle management of the FreeBSD src tree, akin to portmgr@ and doceng@ for the ports and docs trees, respectively.
The initial members are Ed Maste, Mark Johnston, John Baldwin, and Warner Losh.
srcmgr@ is currently focused on finding ways to make src developers more productive, and to try and manage the large numbers of bug reports and pull requests that we receive.
The team meets every two weeks to discuss src-related issues and spend time triaging bug reports and pull requests.
link:https://github.com/freebsd/meetings/tree/master/srcmgr[Meeting minutes] are available on GitHub.
The srcmgr@ team has a link:https://www.freebsd.org/srcmgr/charter/[charter] and is working on developing and documenting policies to help manage the src tree.

In December, srcmgr@ ran an online bug-busting session, attended by 15 developers.
We spent time going through recent bug reports, plus a list of older ones with patches.
The team plans to host monthly sessions of this type, and aims to open them to a wider audience in the future.

The team plans to develop a lurker program similar to portmgr@'s in the first half of 2025.

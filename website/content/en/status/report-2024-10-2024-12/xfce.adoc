The FreeBSD Xfce team (xfce@) works to ensure the Xfce desktop environment is maintained and fully functional on FreeBSD.

This quarter the Xfce team members are pleased to welcome Xfce 4.20 to the FreeBSD ports tree!

This new release adds many stability improvements and some new functionality.

Upstream work for this release was focused on getting the code base ready for Wayland support.

This release brings experimental Wayland support, although not all components have been migrated, so it may not work for you.

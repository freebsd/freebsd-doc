The `bsd-user-4-linux` project ports BSD user-mode emulation for QEMU to Linux.
The primary goal is to enable unmodified FreeBSD binaries to run on modern Linux systems.
Additionally, the project aims to provide multi-platform container images with a functional FreeBSD environment and ready-to-use GitHub Actions templates.

Current Status:
* The initial port successfully runs `make -jN buildworld`.
* Most command-line tools are working as expected (`sh`, `bash`, `find`, `grep`, `git`, `clang`, etc).
* A link:https://github.com/sobomax/qemu-bsd-user-l4b/actions[GitHub Actions pipeline] builds x86_64 emulation images for:
  ** linux/386
  ** linux/amd64
  ** linux/arm/v5
  ** linux/arm64/v8

Next Steps:
* Implement container integration.

How You Can Help:
* Test with your preferred toolchain, report issues, or contribute fixes.
* Build and test non-x86_64 emulation images (e.g., FreeBSD/arm64 on Linux/x86_64). The code works on BSD but needs testing on Linux.

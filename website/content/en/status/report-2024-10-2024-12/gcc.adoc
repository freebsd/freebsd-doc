The link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=281091[exp-run to update GCC default version from 13 to 14] is getting forward.
As usual, thanks to everyone involved.

If you maintain any of the affected ports or want to give a hand preparing and testing some patches, you can consider trying adding `-fpermissive` to `CFLAGS` in affected ports as a temporary solution: GCC 14 has transformed some warnings into errors, which is the cause of many of the failed builds.
The `-fpermissive` flag switches those errors back to warnings.
However, it is preferable that upstream updates its code to remove those warnings completely so that `-fpermissive` is not necessary, possibly with FreeBSD ports maintainers support.
If the code is not maintained upstream anymore, the time might have come to deprecate the port.

Work has been done on some bugs too, mainly upstream:

- link:https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=117210[] has been fixed: a recent change in the FreeBSD headers caused a regression in the GCC 15 development version;
- link:https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=115008[] has been fixed: this was an issue with posix_fallocate failing on FreeBSD on a ZFS filesystem;
- an attempt to fix bug link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=282797[] specific to aarch64 for -devel ports has failed.
If you are able to give a hand on this, it would be very much appreciated.

Thanks to everyone who has helped with these issues.

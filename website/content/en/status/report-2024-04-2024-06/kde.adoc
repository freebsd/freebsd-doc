The KDE on FreeBSD project packages CMake, Qt, and software from the KDE Community, for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.
The mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[KDE team] is part of mailto:desktop@FreeBSD.org[desktop@], building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily driver graphical desktop workstation.

We missed a quarter, while the broader KDE community celebrated the KDE Megarelease of KDE Frameworks 6, KDE Plasma 6 and KDE Gear.
The latest software is still not available on FreeBSD, pending more testing and some integration work.

==== Infrastructure

CMake was updated several times and is now version 3.29.6, the latest upstream release.
CMake in the ports framework now supports setting parallel-build for tests.

Qt5 is now on long-term support and updates only rarely.
An update to 5.15.14 and WebEngine to 5.15.17 was landed in May.

Qt6 and the Python bindings for Qt, Pyside, were updated to version 6.7.2.

==== KDE Stack

KDE Gear, Plasma and Frameworks release happen very regularly.
These updates arrive in the FreeBSD ports tree only piecemeal, due to lagging work on compatibility and testing.

* KDE Frameworks reached version 6.3.0
* KDE Plasma 6 Desktop was updated to version 6.0.4
* KDE Gear 6 has not yet arrived in the ports tree

==== Related Ports

The KDE ecosystem includes a wide range of ports -- most maintained by mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[kde@], all building on a shared base of Qt and KDE Frameworks.
The mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[KDE team] updates them all as needed.
This quarter the KDE team would like to thank mailto:tcberner@FreeBSD.org[Tobias C. Berner], mailto:arrowd@FreeBSD.org[Gleb Popov] and mailto:jhale@FreebSD.org[Jason E. Hale] again for keeping things up-to-date.

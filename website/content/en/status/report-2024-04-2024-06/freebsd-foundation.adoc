Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org>

The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and worldwide community, and helping to advance the state of FreeBSD.
We do this in both technical and non-technical ways.
We are 100% supported by donations from individuals and corporations and those investments help us fund the:

* Software development projects to implement features and functionality in FreeBSD
* Sponsor and organize conferences and developer summits to provide collaborative opportunities and promote FreeBSD
* Purchase and support of hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure
* Resources to improve security, quality assurance, and continuous integration efforts
* Materials and staff needed to promote, educate, and advocate for FreeBSD
* Collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD developers
* Representation of the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require a recognized legal entity

Last quarter we helped FreeBSD celebrate its 31st anniversary!
This community sure loves to celebrate milestones like this one.
We not only saw more users sharing their stories on social media, but many commercial users stepped in to promote their use cases and love for FreeBSD.
It is exciting to see the growth of this project through the improvements made to FreeBSD, as well as the increase in users and contributors.

Over the past few quarters, we have built up our technology, advocacy, and partnership teams to accelerate our work in improving the operating system, increasing the adoption and visibility of FreeBSD, and increasing the number of partners who help fund our work.

Below you will find updates from each team to see the work we have accomplished to support you, the community and the operating system we all love.
But, first I want to share a fundraising update.
Last quarter we raised $41,154 towards our goal of raising over $2,000,000.
You can see our 2024 budget to understand how we are spending your donations here: link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Budget2024-Approved-Public.pdf[].

Over half the budget goes directly into improving and securing FreeBSD.
If there is a security vulnerability out there, we have software developers on staff who can quickly step in, evaluate the situation, and put in a change or workaround if needed.
We have a full-time developer who leads the continuous integration efforts and investigates ways to improve the tools to test code, improve test coverage, and help developers be more efficient.
We have also allocated more funding towards our advocacy efforts.
This includes creating content to highlight FreeBSD's strengths and differentiators, talking to commercial users and documenting their use cases, and promoting the work you are doing.

Please consider funding our efforts to help keep FreeBSD innovative, secure, and stable by making a donation here: link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/donate/[].

If you are a corporate user, please consider becoming a partner!

==== OS Improvements
During the second quarter of 2024, 204 src, 50 ports, and 11 doc tree commits identified The FreeBSD Foundation as a sponsor.

The Foundation is sponsoring 13 projects.

* mailto:christos@FreeBSD.org[Christos Margiolis] continued to improve FreeBSD's audio stack and provide audio developers with useful tools and frameworks to facilitate sound development on FreeBSD.
Refer to the <<_audio_stack_improvements,Audio Stack Improvements>> entry for details.

* mailto:pjd@FreeBSD.org[Pawel Dawidek] is in the final stages of a project to add hierarchical rate limits to OpenZFS.
For details, refer to the <<_hierarchical_rate_limits_for_openzfs,Hierarchical rate limits for OpenZFS>> report entry and the link:https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/16205[pull request in the OpenZFS repository].

* Long-term contractor mailto:olce@FreeBSD.org[Olivier Certner] was active in a few different parts of the tree:
** man:rtprio[2]: Updating the number of queues per runqueue from 64 to 256
** UnionFS: reviewed work from mailto:jah@FreeBSD.org[Jason A. Harmening].
   Jason's work fixes many locking problems (wild accesses without locks, deadlocks, etc.), particularly in unionfs_rename() and improves locking logic.
** Vnode recycling/ZFS ARC reclaim: Reviewed a fix for link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=275594[bug #275594], liaised with upstream to obtain and test a backport, had an EN issued and applied as 13.3-RELEASE-p2, and started longer-term work to improve the vnode reclaiming mechanisms and have ZFS pass the right information
** ULE scheduler: Updated to work on a single runqueue instead of 3 for POSIX compliance with respect to the number of distinct SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR priority levels
** Miscellaneous: Many (26) reviews, ports updates, and investigated DRM problems
** Published a link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/eurobsdcon-2023/[EuroBSDCon 2023 conference report in the FreeBSD Journal].

* mailto:pierre@freebsdfoundation.org[Pierre Pronchery] continued work on a security-focused project with the Foundation that included:
** working on a conversion tool from link:https://vuxml.freebsd.org/freebsd/index.html[VuXML] to link:https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/[OSV]
** automating the generation of VuXML reports across all ports with link:https://www.freshports.org/security/osv-scanner/[security/osv-scanner]
** running Coverity Scan reports around bhyve and assisting in rectifying the reported defects

* Work continued on a joint project between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and The FreeBSD Foundation to develop a complete FreeBSD AMD IOMMU driver.
  This work will allow FreeBSD to fully support greater than 256 cores with features such as CPU mapping and will also include bhyve integration.
  mailto:kib@FreeBSD.org[Konstantin Belousov] has been working on various parts of the project, including driver attachment, register definitions, an ACPI table parser, and utility functions.
  Two key components that need to be completed are context handling, which is mostly a generalization of Intel DMAR code, and page table creation.
  After this, the AMD driver's enable bit can be turned on for testing.
  To follow all of Konstantin's work, look for src commits tagged with Sponsored by fields for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and The FreeBSD Foundation.

* The Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is an open-source, high-performance user space networking stack that provides fast packet processing suitable for software-defined networking and network function virtualization applications.
  mailto:thj@FreeBSD.org[Tom Jones] is wrapping up his part on a project to port VPP to FreeBSD.
  The code has been shared with RG Nets, a co-sponsor of the work, for extensive testing.

* mailto:bz@FreeBSD.org[Björn Zeeb] continued to improve wireless networking on FreeBSD.
  As with last quarter, the focus was mainly on bug fixes and stability improvements.
  Most of Bjoern's 30+ src commits were to LinuxKPI and net80211 code.

* mailto:philip@FreeBSD.org[Philip Paeps] is working on a 20-hour-per-month, six-month contract to continue modernizing the FreeBSD cluster.
This work includes moving more servers to our newest cluster site at NYI in Chicago.

* mailto:bofh@FreeBSD.org[Moin Rahman] is under two contracts.
Moin is nearing completion of a Center for Internet Security (CIS) hardening guide and continues work to establish pre-commit CI.

* mailto:freebsd@igalic.co[Mina Galić] continues efforts to put FreeBSD cloud-init support on par with Linux support.

* mailto:mhorne@FreeBSD.org[Mitchell Horne] presented his RISC-V work at the FreeBSD developer summit.
You can read about the latest developments in the <<_freebsd_riscv64,FreeBSD/riscv64>> report entry.

* Refer to mailto:starbops@hey.com[Chih-Hsin Chang]'s <<_openstack_on_freebsd,OpenStack on FreeBSD>> report entry for the latest updates on the project to port OpenStack components so that OpenStack can be run on FreeBSD hosts.

Other members of the Foundation's technology team contributed to FreeBSD development efforts.
For example, Mark Johnston, along with Andrew Turner, authored basic routines to build a Flattened Device Tree (FDT) for arm64 bhyve guests.
The FDT describes various hardware components like CPUs, memory, UART, PCIe controller, interrupt controller, and platform timer, which the guest OS needs to know about.
Ed Maste committed a variety of src contributions, including modernization of man:tzsetup[8] and correcting an issue with man:diff[1] options.
Balancing their regular responsibilities, Li-Wen Hsu and Joe Mingrone contributed updates and fixes to various ports, including addressing pressing security issues.

==== Continuous Integration and Workflow Improvement
As part of our continued support of the FreeBSD Project, the Foundation supports a full-time staff member dedicated to improving the Project's continuous integration system and test infrastructure.

==== Partnerships and Research

In the Second Quarter, Greg Wallace, the Foundation Partnerships lead, attended the Open Source Summit event in Seattle.
There he joined Doug Rabson who gave a talk on the work of the FreeBSD OCI Runtime Extension working Group.
link:https://youtu.be/pggcc6fi-ow?si=0veLZJ5J4rXCWAHY[You can check it out here].
Greg also used the event to connect with a number of key tech companies to advance major joint technology initiatives.
link:[Greg's write up on the event is here].

Work continues on other highly-requested features.
RG Nets and others have been making great strides to bring CUDA and related AI stack components to FreeBSD.
The Foundation is seeking ways to coordinate across users of FreeBSD to get support for a variety of AI technologies on FreeBSD.
One idea is to launch a FreeBSD AI lab that would pool money from supporters to get CUDA fully supported on FreeBSD and to round out DPU driver support.
mailto:partnerships@freebsdfoundation.org[Please contact us if you would like to support such an initiative].

Work continues to leverage the heroic work from the FreeBSD Community to get .NET supported on FreeBSD so that downstream dependencies can in turn better support FreeBSD.
More to come on this front soon.

Thanks to the generous grant from Alpha-Omega, the FreeBSD Foundation has undertaken two code audits of important subsystems carried out by Synactiv.
Alpha-Omega is an open source project with a mission to protect society by catalyzing sustainable security improvements to the most critical open source software projects and ecosystems.
link:https://github.com/khorben/alpha-omega/blob/freebsd/alpha/engagements/2024/FreeBSD/update-2024-06.md[Our most recent monthly update can be found here].
The code audits will conclude in July and then we will then undertake a process audit and will also run a 2FA pilot.

In Q1 and Q2, Greg participated in several meetings about various government regulations.
In March, he represented FreeBSD at the link:https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-announces-new-efforts-help-secure-open-source-ecosystem[CISA two-day Open Source Software (OSS) Security Summit] alongside other link:https://opensource.org/programs/open-policy-alliance[Open Policy Alliance members].
Previously, Greg collaborated with OPA to submit comments to CISA's RFC on how the US Government can support the security and sustainability of Open Source.
And in June, The FreeBSD Foundation joined the link:https://outreach.eclipse.foundation/open-regulatory-compliance[Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group] at the Eclipse Foundation.
This group aims to accelerate the development of cohesive cybersecurity processes required for regulatory compliance while offering a neutral environment for hosting technical discussions with the open source community at large.

We are thrilled to welcome Alice Sowerby as a part time, contract Partnerships Program Manager.
Alice is an experienced, multi-skilled leader, currently active in a number of open source domains.
She is the co-host of the CHAOSS podcast and chair of the TODO group review team for the OSPO Book.
Alice is providing program and project management for partnership initiatives, like Alpha-Omega, OCI FreeBSD Runtime Extension WG, and the Enterprise Working Group.

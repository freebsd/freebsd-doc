The OpenStack on FreeBSD project aims to integrate OpenStack cloud infrastructure with the FreeBSD operating system, utilizing FreeBSD's unique features while maintaining compatibility with OpenStack standards.

In the second quarter of 2024, we continued to advance the project significantly.
One of our key activities was attending BSDCan 2024, where we presented on link:https://youtu.be/TUHfTw6OX-8?si=2ramynfxOwa9MgYe["Towards a Robust FreeBSD-based Cloud: Porting OpenStack Components"].
This presentation helped increase the project's visibility and attracted interest from potential contributors.

We expanded the current single-node proof-of-concept (POC) site to a three-node setup.
This involved detailed environment setup and network planning.
Additionally, we began migrating the base to FreeBSD 15.0-CURRENT to ensure our project stays aligned with the latest advancements in FreeBSD.

We also started working on adapting the manual installation steps and code patches into FreeBSD ports, aiming to streamline the installation process for future users.
Another major milestone was initiating work on making bare-metal provisioning function on both FreeBSD instances and service hosts for OpenStack Ironic.

Looking forward to the next quarter, our focus will be on refining these advancements and further enhancing the project's robustness and ease of use.
Specifically, we aim to upgrade our OpenStack components from the Xena version to a more recent release, as Xena has entered the "unmaintained" phase and will soon reach EOL.
We welcome any suggestions and contributions from the community to help us achieve our goals.

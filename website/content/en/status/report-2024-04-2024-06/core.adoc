==== 2024 Core Team Election

Core.12 appointed Muhammad Moinur Rahman (bofh@) and Allan Jude (allanjude@) as the managers of the 2024 Core Team election.
After Allan decided to run for Core, Moin continued to handle all the election tasks independently.

The result was announced on June 12th, with 8 members:

* Allan Jude (allanjude@)
* Dave Cottlehuber (dch@)
* Gleb Smirnoff (glebius@)
* Hiroki Sato (hrs@)
* Li-Wen Hsu (lwhsu@)
* Mathieu Arnold (mat@)
* Olivier Cochard (olivier@)
* Tobias C. Berner (tcberner@)

Mike Karels has run for the 2024 Core Team election, and was in the top nine candidates in the result.
After a discussion, core.13 came to the conclusion that the eight members will serve as the new team.

Core.13 takes office on June 12th, and hold the handover meeting with core.12 on June 21st.

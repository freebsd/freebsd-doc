The FreeBSD Project has been trying an experiment to accept contributions via GitHub pull requests.
We have learned a lot in the last year that we've been doing this.
We have created a number of rules relating to the pull requests.
In general, pull requests should only be for things that are user-visible, add value to the project and are ready to go, modulo final review.

Current status:

 * We are able to keep up with the pull requests doing everything by hand, but only if we do it at least weekly.
 * We have discovered the by-hand process is tedious and error-prone.
 * We can stage multiple pull requests in a testing branch so we can batch-up testing.
 * We can automatically land the result so merged pull requests show up as merged in GitHub infrastructure.

We need help with automating the process:

 * Add automated testing that's context specific (for example, run igor over man pages).
 * Add build/install tests that test-boot the resulting image.
 * Automate common tasks, like man page corrections, into staging process.
 * Add simple smoke testing for the staging branch for tier 1 architectures.
 * Investigate optionally integrating Jenkins testing to scale up the size of changes we can accept.
 * Integrate with Bugzilla problem reports and Phabricator reviews.
 * Improve the submitter experience on GitHub by automating common feedback to mistakes in the pull requests.
 * Create checklists for submitters to reduce errors.
 * Create better reporting about pull requests, especially the frequent contributors of good pull requests.

We are coordinating on FreeBSD's Discord in the #github-hacking channel.
Join us there to pitch in, or just chat about the project.

Once things are fine-tuned, we want to publicity to steer contributors, at least the base system, to GitHub pull requests.
We need more developers looking at the FreeBSD GitHub pull requests.
We will also need more developers to review and land pull requests once it is automated and the automation has matured.
We sincerely hope that we can improve the FreeBSD contribution experience with this, as well as gain useful fixes from the community.

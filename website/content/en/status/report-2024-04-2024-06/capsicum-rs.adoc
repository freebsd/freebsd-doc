Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework implementing a
hybrid capability system model.

I've adopted the library providing Rust bindings for Capsicum, and extended it
with support for man:libcasper[3] and man:cap_net[3].
It's already being used by package:net-mgmt/nfs-exporter[] and by a TLS-enabled
FTP server (the FTP server is closed-source, but all of the interesting bits
reside in an open source library, and an example server can be found at
link:https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/tree/master/crates/unftp-sbe-fs/examples[]).

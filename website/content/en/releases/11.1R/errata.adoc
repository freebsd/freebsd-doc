[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.1-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[.note]
*Note*: +
This advisory addresses the most significant issues for FreeBSD 11.1 on amd64 CPUs. We expect to update this advisory to include 10.x for amd64 CPUs. Future FreeBSD releases will address this issue on i386 and other CPUs.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* FreeBSD/i386 installed on ZFS may crash during boot when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified `GENERIC` kernel.
+
A system tunable has been added as of revision `r286584` to make the `kern.kstack_pages` tunable configurable without recompiling the kernel.
+
To mitigate system crashes with such configurations, choose `Escape to loader prompt` in the boot menu and enter the following lines from https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=loader&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[loader(8)] prompt, after an `OK`:
+
[.screen]
----
set kern.kstack_pages=4
boot
----
+
Add this line to `/boot/loader.conf` for the change to persist across reboots:
+
[.programlisting]
----
kern.kstack_pages=4
----
* [2017-07-21] Due to a bug in earlier versions of https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&sektion=1&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[clang(1)] that is difficult to work around in the upgrade process, to upgrade the system from sources via buildworld to -CURRENT or 11.1-RELEASE, it is necessary to upgrade machines running 9.x to at least revision r286035, or machines running 10.x to revision r286033. Source-based upgrades from 10.3-RELEASE are not affected. This differs from the historical situation where one could generally upgrade from anywhere on earlier stable branches, so caution should be exercised.
* [2017-07-25] FreeBSD/arm64 currently lacks EFI real-time clock (RTC) support, which may cause the system to boot with the wrong time set.
+
As a workaround, either enable https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ntpdate&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[ntpdate(8)] or include `ntpd_sync_on_start="YES"` in https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&sektion=5&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[rc.conf(5)].
* [2017-07-25] A late issue was discovered with FreeBSD/arm64 and "root on ZFS" installations where the root ZFS pool would fail to be located.
+
There currently is no workaround.
* [2017-07-26] Note for those upgrading from 11.1-RC2 in VirtualBox:
+
If system panics were experienced when upgrading from 11.1-RC1 to 11.1-RC2, and the `emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions{,-nox11}` port was built locally as a resolution, the port will either need to be rebuilt when upgrading from 11.1-RC2 to 11.1-RELEASE, or reinstall the package from the pkg(8) mirrors using either:
+
[.screen]
----
 # pkg install -f virtualbox-ose-additions
----
+
or
+
[.screen]
----
 # pkg install -f virtualbox-ose-additions-nox11
----
+
To ensure the system does not panic after rebooting into the updated kernel, it is recommended to disable the `vboxguest` service in https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&sektion=5&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[rc.conf(5)] prior to rebooting the system if possible, or use https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[pkg(8)] to forcefully reinstall the package.
+
Systems being upgraded from 11.1-RC1 and earlier and 11.1-RC3 to 11.1-RELEASE should be unaffected.
* [2017-07-27] The release notes erroneously state revision `r315330` was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate), when in fact this work was done by Hiroki Mori independently.
* [2017-08-09] The release notes stated the https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ruptime&sektion=1&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[ruptime(1)], https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rwho&sektion=1&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[rwho(1)], and https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rwhod&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[rwhod(8)] utilities have been marked "deprecated", however this change was reversed in 12.0-CURRENT.
+
The other utilities mentioned in the entry in the release notes, however, are unchanged.
* [2017-11-06] An issue with FreeBSD virtual machines with vagrant was discovered that affects the VirtualBox where the virtual machine will not start on the initial boot invoked with `vagrant up`.
+
The issue is due to the virtual machine MAC being unset, as FreeBSD does not provide a default `Vagrantfile`.
+
It has been observed, however, that a subsequent invocation of `vagrant up` will allow the virtual machine to successfully boot, allowing access via `vagrant ssh`.

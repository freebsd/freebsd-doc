= FreeBSD 4.0 Announcement

*Date:* Tue, 14 Mar 2000 22:29:43 -0800 (PST) +
*From:* "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@zippy.cdrom.com> +
*To:* announce@FreeBSD.org +
*Subject:* 4.0-RELEASE is now available

Well, it's a bit late and hopefully all the better for it, but here it is. It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE. This is our first release along the 4.x-stable (RELENG_4) branch and contains a number of significant advancements over FreeBSD 3.4. Please see the release notes for further information as the list of new features is too long to list here.

FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE is available from ftp.FreeBSD.org and various FTP mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.freebsdmall.com/[The FreeBSD Mall], from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set. There will also be two such sets available for 4.0, one containing installation bits for the x86 architecture (as well a lot of other material of general interest to programmers and end-users alike) and another for DEC Alpha architecture machines.

As usual, disc #1 from Walnut Creek CDROM's official distribution (for both architectures) will also be available via anonymous FTP as soon as it's been compiled in its final form. Please monitor the master FTP site for details. We also can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry this rather large (660MB) installation image, but it will at least be available (once ready) from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso +
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso

These files allow one to install the base system and all of its most important add-ons from a single bootable image, one which can be written as a raw ISO 9660 image by most CD creator software.

Even though we make our installation CDs freely available, we also hope that you'll continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing one of its official CD releases from the FreeBSD mall. A portion of each sale goes to support FreeBSD's development and general infrastructure and is thus highly appreciated.

The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Or via the WEB pages at:

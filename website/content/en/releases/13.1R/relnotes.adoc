== Abstract

[.abstract-title]
The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution. It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/] or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}/mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD appendix] to the link:{handbook}/[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since {releasePrev}. In general, changes described here are unique to the {releaseBranch} branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release notes: 

* include recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades
* may also include changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. 

Release note documents such as this do not list every change between releases. This document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in [.filename]#/usr/src/UPDATING#.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.

[[userland]]
== Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications, contributed software, and system utilities.

[[userland-config]]
=== Userland Configuration Changes

// SAMPLE ENTRY:
// A new man:rc.conf[5] variable has been added, `linux_mounts_enable`, which controls if Linux(R)-specific filesystems are mounted in [.filename]#/compat/linux# if `linux_enable` is set to `YES`. {{< revision "364883" >}} _(Sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation)_

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other storage subsystems, both local and networked.

[[boot]]
== Boot Loader Changes

This section covers the boot loader, boot menu, and other boot-related changes.

[[boot-loader]]
=== Boot Loader Changes

UEFI boot is improved for amd64. The loader detects whether the loaded kernel can handle the in-place staging area (non-copying mode). The default is `copy_staging auto`. Auto-detection can be overridden, for example: with `copy_staging enable`, the loader will unconditionally copy the staging area to 2M, regardless of kernel capabilities. Also, the code to grow the staging area is more robust; for growth to occur, it's no longer necessary to hand-tune and recompile the loader. _(Sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation)_

[[future-releases-cputype]]
=== Default `CPUTYPE` Change

With FreeBSD-13.0, the default `CPUTYPE` for the i386 architecture changed from `486` to `686`.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland. Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` option in the kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This also aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default `CPUTYPE` in i386.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This change does not affect the FreeBSD 12.x series of releases.

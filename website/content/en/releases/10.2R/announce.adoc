= FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE Announcement

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE. This is the third release of the stable/{{% param thisBranch %}} branch, which improves on the stability of FreeBSD {{% param lastRelease %}}-RELEASE and introduces some new features.

Some of the highlights:

* The `resolvconf(8)` utility has been updated to version 3.7.0, with improvements to protect DNS privacy.
* The ntp suite has been updated to version 4.2.8p3.
* A new `rc(8)` script, `growfs`, has been added, which will resize the root filesystem on boot if the `/firstboot` file exists.
* The Linux(R) compatibility version has been updated to support Centos(TM) 6 ports.
* The drm code has been updated to match Linux(R) version 3.8.13, allowing running multiple X servers simultaneously.
* Several enhancements and updates for improved FreeBSD/arm support.
* Several ZFS performance and reliability improvements.
* GNOME has been updated to version 3.14.2.
* KDE has been updated to version 4.14.3.
* And much more...

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the online release notes and errata list, available at:

* `https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{{% param thisRelease %}}r/relnotes/`

== Availability

FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, powerpc64, sparc64, and armv6 architectures.

FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded via FTP as described in the section below. While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures, they will all generally contain the more common ones such as amd64 and i386.

SHA256 and MD5 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and SD card images are included at the bottom of this message.

PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available at:

* https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{{% param thisRelease %}}r/signatures/

A PGP-signed version of this announcement is available at:

* https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{{% param thisRelease %}}r/announce.asc

Additional UEFI-capable images are available for the amd64 (x86_64) architecture.

The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:

*dvd1*: +
This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD operating system, the documentation, and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.

*disc1*: +
This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.

*bootonly*: +
This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not contain the installation distribution sets for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network based install (e.g., from an FTP server) after booting from the CD.

*memstick*: +
This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.

As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:

....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=10240 conv=sync
....

Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

*mini-memstick*: +
This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to boot a machine, but does not contain the installation distribution sets on the medium itself, similar to the bootonly image. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.

As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:

....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....

Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

*FreeBSD/arm SD card images*: +
These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the supported arm system. The SD card image contains the full FreeBSD installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as small as 512Mb.

For convenience for those without console access to the system, a `freebsd` user with a password of `freebsd`is available by default for `ssh(1)` access. Additionally, the `root` user password is set to `root`, which it is strongly recommended to change the password for both users after gaining access to the system.

To write the FreeBSD/arm image to an SD card, use the `dd(1)` utility, replacing _KERNEL_ with the appropriate kernel configuration name for the system.

....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE-arm-armv6-KERNEL.img of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....

Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM or DVD from several vendors. One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-based products is:

* FreeBSD Mall, Inc.` https://www.freebsdmall.com`

Pre-installed virtual machine images are also available for the amd64 (x86_64) and i386 (x86_32) architectures in `QCOW2`, `VHD`, and `VMDK` disk image formats, as well as raw (unformatted) images.

FreeBSD {{% param thisRelease %}}-RELEASE amd64 is also available on these cloud hosting platforms:

* Amazon(R) EC2(TM): +
AMIs are available in the following regions:
+
....
us-east-1 region: ami-f709a29c
us-west-1 region: ami-bbc43aff
us-west-2 region: ami-2b88821b

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 10.2-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* FreeBSD/i386 10.2-RELEASE running as a guest operating system on VirtualBox# can have a problem with disk I/O access. It depends on some specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a specific version of VirtualBox or host operating system.
+
It has been reported that instability may be present on virtual machines running on other hypervisors, such as Xen or KVM.
+
It causes various errors and makes FreeBSD quite unstable. Although the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O works as a workaround. To disable it, choose `Escape to loader prompt` in the boot menu and enter the following lines from http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=loader&sektion=8[loader(8)] prompt, after an `OK`:
+
[.screen]
----
set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
boot
----
+
Note that the following line has to be added to `/boot/loader.conf` after a boot. It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:
+
[source,programlisting]
----
vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
----
* FreeBSD/i386 10.2-RELEASE installed on ZFS may crash during boot when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified `GENERIC` kernel.
+
As described in `/usr/src/UPDATING` entry `20121223`, rebuilding the kernel with `options KSTACK_PAGES=4` has been observed to resolve the boot-time crash. This, however, is not an ideal solution for inclusion in the `GENERIC` kernel configuration, as increasing `KSTACK_PAGES` implicitly decreases available usermode threads in an environment that is already resource-starved.
+
Taking into account the heavy resource requirements of ZFS, in addition to the i386-specific tuning requirements for general workloads, using ZFS with the FreeBSD/i386 `GENERIC` kernel is strongly discouraged.
+
If installing FreeBSD/i386 on ZFS, it is possible to configure the system after installation to increase the `KSTACK_PAGES`.
+
When prompted by http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdinstall&sektion=8[bsdinstall(8)] to perform additional post-installation configuration to the system, select [.guibutton]#[ YES ]#.
+
This procedure requires the system sources available locally. If the `System source code` distribution was not selected during installation, it can be obtained using svnlite:
+
[.screen]
----
# mkdir -p /usr/src
# svnlite co svn://svn.freebsd.org/base/releng/10.2 /usr/src
----
+
Build the `kernel-toolchain` required to rebuild the kernel:
+
[.screen]
----
# make -C /usr/src kernel-toolchain
----
+
Next, create a kernel configuration file to increase the `KSTACK_PAGES` option:
+
[.screen]
----
# printf "include GENERIC\noptions KSTACK_PAGES=4\n" > /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/ZFS
----
+
Then build and install the _`ZFS`_ kernel:
+
[.screen]
----
# make -C /usr/src buildkernel KERNCONF=ZFS
# make -C /usr/src installkernel KERNCONF=ZFS
----
+

[.warning]
*Warning*: +
It is extremely important to take note that, by default, http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] will install the `GENERIC` kernel configuration, and as such, http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] consumers are strongly encouraged to avoid FreeBSD-provided kernel binary upgrades with such configurations.

* Due to an incompatibility between http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdconfig&sektion=8[bsdconfig(8)] and http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8[pkg(8)], packages included on the FreeBSD dvd installer will not be recognized by http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdconfig&sektion=8[bsdconfig(8)].
+
To install packages from the `dvd1.iso` installer, create the `/dist` target directory, and manually mount the `dvd1.iso` ISO:
+
[.screen]
----
# mkdir -p /dist
# mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /dist
----
+
[.note]
*Note*: +
Be sure to use the correct `/dev` device path for the `dvd1.iso` ISO installer.
+
Next, set `REPOS_DIR` to the path of the `repos/` directory within the installer so http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8[pkg(8)] will use the correct repository metadata.
+
If using http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sh&sektion=1[sh(1)]:
+
[.screen]
----
# export REPOS_DIR=/dist/packages/repos
----
+
If using http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=csh&sektion=1[csh(1)]:
+
[.screen]
----
# setenv REPOS_DIR /dist/packages/repos
----
+
[.note]
*Note*: +
Keep in mind that `REPOS_DIR` will need to be set again after the current shell session is terminated, if continuing to use the packages provided on the `dvd1.iso` installer.
+
Finally, bootstrap http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8[pkg(8)] from the ISO, and install required packages:
+
[.screen]
----
# pkg bootstrap
# pkg install xorg-server xorg gnome3 [...]
----
* An issue was discovered where the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=netstat&sektion=1[netstat(1)] `-s` option will cause a segmentation fault on systems with `IPSEC` compiled into the kernel. The issue was resolved in the `stable/10` branch, and an Errata Notice is planned after 10.2-RELEASE is released.
+
[2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:12.
* An issue was discovered that causes http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=make&sektion=1[make(1)] to generate noisy output when doing source-based upgrades from FreeBSD 9.3 and earlier. The issue was reported in PR 202277, and after investigation and determining the issue does not cause source-based upgrades to fail, a post-release Errata Notice is planned.
+
[2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:11.
* An issue with FreeBSD virtual machines with vagrant was discovered that affects the VirtualBox where the virtual machine will not start on the initial boot invoked with `vagrant up`.
+
The issue is due to the virtual machine MAC being unset, as FreeBSD does not provide a default `Vagrantfile`.
+
It has been observed, however, that a subsequent invocation of `vagrant up` will allow the virtual machine to successfully boot, allowing access via `vagrant ssh`.
* [2015-08-16] An error was discovered in the release notes for FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE regarding the `drm` device driver. The entry for r282199 states the driver was updated to match the version Linux(R) 3.8.13 version, however the entry should have noted the change affects device-independent code, and does not bring the `drm` driver fully in line with the stated Linux(R) version.

= FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} Release Notes

== Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

== Table of Contents

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD RELEASE.CURRENT. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The RELEASE.TYPE distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the RELEASE.BRANCH development branch since RELEASE.BRANCH was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary RELEASE.TYPE distributions along this branch can be found at .

The RELEASE.TYPE distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the RELEASE.BRANCH development branch between RELEASE.PREV and the future RELEASE.NEXT. Information regarding pre-built, binary RELEASE.TYPE distributions along this branch can be found at .

This distribution of FreeBSD RELEASE.CURRENT is a RELEASE.TYPE distribution. It can be found at or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) RELEASE.TYPE distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}#mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix] to the link:{handbook}[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD RELEASE.CURRENT can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since RELEASE.PREV. In general, changes described here are unique to the RELEASE.BRANCH branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after RELEASE.PREV, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8">}} utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8">}} utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in `/usr/src/UPDATING`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.

[[future-releases]]
== General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

[[future-releases-cputype]]
=== Default `CPUTYPE` Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default `CPUTYPE` for the i386 architecture will change from `486` to `686`.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland. Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` option in the kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This also aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default `CPUTYPE` in i386.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This change does not affect the FreeBSD 12.x series of releases.

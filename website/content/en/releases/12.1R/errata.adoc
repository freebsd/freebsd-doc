[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD {release} Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD {releaseBranch} also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

== Open Issues

[2019-11-04] A late issue was discovered where systems using the graphics/drm-kmod port built on FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE will crash during boot. It is advised to remove the port prior to upgrading, and build the port instead of using the upstream binary package.

== Late-Breaking News

[2019-11-22] The FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE announcement includes mention of FreeBSD/amd64 Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). Though it also included mention of FreeBSD/aarch64 being available in various regions, it had not passed third-party validation for inclusion in the Amazon(R) Marketplace.

FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE aarch64 Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMIs are now available in the Marketplace https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B081NF7BY7[here].

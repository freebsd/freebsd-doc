= FreeBSD 2.2.5 Announcement

*Date:* 22 Oct 1997 14:09:08 -0500 +
*From:* "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@time.cdrom.com> +
*Subject:* 2.2.5 RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org (and some mirrors)

It is my great pleasure, as always, to announce the release of FreeBSD 2.2.5, our next release on the 2.2-stable branch. Those folks who are still running 2.1.x and wish to upgrade to 2.2 technology are now encouraged to do so as 2.2.5 has reached an equivalent level of stability in all of our tests. A number of annoying problems with 2.2.2 have also been fixed (see the link:../notes/[release notes] for more information on this).

FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE is available on ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD[ftp.freebsd.org] and various https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html[FTP mirror sites] throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.cdrom.com/[Walnut Creek CDROM], from where it will be shipping shortly as a new 4 CD set containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to programmers and general users alike.

since ftp.freebsd.org is itself rather overloaded at the present time (Id software and Slackware Linux chose the same time to release their latest products :).

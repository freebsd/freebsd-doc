= FreeBSD {release} Errata

== Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD {release}, containing significant information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD {release} will be maintained until the release of FreeBSD {releaseNext}.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD {release} Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD {releaseBranch} also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* [2018-12-11] Some Intel(R) J1900 systems may hang on boot in UEFI mode. An observed workaround is to set `kern.vty=sc` at the {{< manpage "loader" "8">}} prompt. To have the setting persist after {{< manpage "reboot" "8">}}, add `kern.vty=sc` to {{< manpage "loader" "5">}}.
+
See PR https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=230172[230172] for more information.

* [2018-12-11] OpenSSL version 1.1.1 disables use of hardware cryptography accelerator cards provided by {{< manpage "crypto" "4">}} by default. Systems that have cryptography devices such as {{< manpage "hifn" "4">}}, {{< manpage "padlock" "4">}}, {{< manpage "safe" "4">}}, and {{< manpage "ubsec" "4">}} currently will not take advantage of hardware cryptography offloading.
+
It is currently unclear if an Errata Notice will be issued to re-enable use of {{< manpage "crypto" "4">}}.

* [2018-12-13] Due to the size of the base system of FreeBSD 12.0, the disc1.iso images for amd64 and i386 do not fit onto a 700 MB CD-ROM. As of FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE, however, disc1.iso for these architectures can be written to a flash drive, or to a DVD.
+
See PR https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=233989[233989] for more information.

* [2018-12-13] Some users have reported FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE boot messages do not report CPUs other than `CPU0`. This is expected behavior introduced in `r333334`, and results in boot-time reduction.

* [2018-12-13] The FreeBSD 12.0 release notes mention use of [.filename]`graphics/drm-stable-kmod` and [.filename]`graphics/drm-legacy-kmod` for modern graphics cards. These ports have been changed to a "meta port" in the Ports Collection, and will be renamed in the `2019Q1` quarterly branch, after which [.filename]`graphics/drm-kmod` should be used instead.

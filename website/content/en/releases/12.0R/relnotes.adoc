[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution. It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}#mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix] to the link:{handbook}[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since {releasePrev}. In general, changes described here are unique to the {releaseBranch} branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8">}} utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8">}} utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in `/usr/src/UPDATING`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.

[[hardware]]
== Hardware Support

This section covers general hardware support for physical machines, hypervisors, and virtualization environments, as well as hardware changes and updates that do not otherwise fit in other sections of this document.

[[hardware-support]]
=== Hardware Support

Support for powernv POWER9 MMU initialization has been added. {{< revision "333273" >}}

[[hardware-graphics]]
=== Graphics Support

FreeBSD has changed the way graphics drivers are handled on amd64 and i386. Graphics drivers for modern ATI/AMD(R) and Intel(R) graphics cards are now available in the Ports Collection. The base drivers are still available and will be installed by default, but they lack support for current generation laptop and desktop systems.

In most cases it is enough to install `graphics/drm-kmod` from ports or packages to install a driver appropriate for the system, then adding the appropriate driver to `kld_list` in {{< manpage "rc.conf" "5">}}.

For Intel(R) (i915) systems after Broadwell(TM), the {{< manpage "rc.conf" "5">}} entry is:

....
kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko"
....

Systems with ATI/AMD(R) graphics cards have two options. Modern systems starting with the HD7000 series GPU should use:

....
kld_list="/boot/modules/amdgpu.ko"
....

Systems with cards released before the HD7000 GPU use:

....
kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko"
....

[.note]
*Note*: +
Users must be added to the `video` GID after installing `graphics/drm-kmod` in order for X to start properly.

[.note]
*Note*: +
There are known issues with the `xserver` driver provided by `x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati` when using graphics drivers from the base system; `x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati-legacy` should be used instead.

[.note]
*Note*: +
There is a known issue where booting with UEFI and using the ATI/AMD(R) graphics driver may cause the screen to be garbled before the appropriate driver is loaded.
For additional information regarding graphics support on FreeBSD, please see the https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics[Graphics Wiki Page].

[[hardware-virtualization]]
=== Virtualization Support

Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMI instances now have `sysutils/amazon-ssm-agent` installed by default, though the service is not enabled by default in {{< manpage "rc.conf" "5">}}. To enable the service, add: {{< revision "325254" >}}

[.programlisting]
....
  >>/etc/rc.conf
    amazon_ssm_agent_enable="YES"
....

to the EC2(TM) user-data.

Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMI instances now disable `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` in {{< manpage "sshd_config" "5">}} by default. {{< revision "326564" >}}

Amazon(R) EC2(TM) AMI instances now use the Amazon(R) internal NTP service by default. {{< revision "326565" >}}

The {{< manpage "bhyve" "8">}} utility has been updated to allow controlling CPU topology from userland. {{< revision "332298" >}}

The {{< manpage "bhyve" "8">}} utility has been updated to add {{< manpage "virtio_scsi" "4">}} storage support. {{< revision "334940" >}} {{< sponsored "iXsystems" >}}

The {{< manpage "bhyve" "8">}} utility has been updated to add NVMe device emulation. {{< revision "335974" >}} {{< sponsored "iXsystems" >}}

A new {{< manpage "sysctl" "8">}}, `security.jail.vmm_allowed`, has been added, which when set to `1` allows {{< manpage "bhyve" "8">}} use within a {{< manpage "jail" "8">}}. {{< revision "337023" >}} {{< sponsored "HardenedBSD, G2, Inc." >}}

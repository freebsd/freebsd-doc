The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD {thisRelease}-RELEASE. This is the {which} release of the stable/{thisBranch} branch.

Some of the highlights:

* Updates to the wireless networking stack and various drivers have been introduced to provide better 802.11n and 802.11ac support.
* The `ice(4)` driver has been added, supporting Intel(R) 100Gb ethernet cards.
* The `jail(8)` utility has been updated to allow running Linux(R) in a jailed environment.
* OpenSSL has been updated to version 1.1.1h.
* OpenSSH has been updated to version 7.9p1.
* The `clang`, `llvm`, `lld`, `lldb`, `compiler-rt` utilities and `libc++` have been updated to version 10.0.1.
* And much more...

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the online release notes and errata list, available at:

* `https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{thisRelease}R/relnotes.html`

== Availability

FreeBSD {thisRelease}-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64, sparc64, armv6, and aarch64 architectures.

FreeBSD {thisRelease}-RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded as described in the section below.

SHA512 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and SD card images are included at the bottom of this message.

PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available at:

* https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{thisRelease}R/signatures.html

A PGP-signed version of this announcement is available at:

* https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/{thisRelease}R/announce.asc

The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:

dvd1::
This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD operating system, the documentation, debugging distribution sets, and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.
+
Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.
+
As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.
disc1::
This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.
bootonly::
This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not contain the installation distribution sets for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network based install (e.g., from an HTTP or FTP server) after booting from the CD.
+
Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.
memstick::
This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.
mini-memstick::
This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to boot a machine, but does not contain the installation distribution sets on the medium itself, similar to the bootonly image. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.
FreeBSD/arm SD card images::
These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the supported arm system. The SD card image contains the full FreeBSD installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as small as 512Mb.
+
For convenience for those without console access to the system, a `freebsd` user with a password of `freebsd` is available by default for `ssh(1)` access. Additionally, the `root` user password is set to `root`, which it is strongly recommended to change the password for both users after gaining access to the system.
+
To write the FreeBSD/arm image to an SD card, use the `dd(1)` utility, replacing _KERNEL_ with the appropriate kernel configuration name for the system.
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-{thisRelease}-RELEASE-arm-armv6-KERNEL.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

FreeBSD {thisRelease}-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM or DVD from several vendors. One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD {thisRelease}-based products is:

* FreeBSD Mall, Inc.` https://www.freebsdmall.com`

Pre-installed virtual machine images are also available for the amd64 (x86_64), i386 (x86_32), and AArch64 (arm64) architectures in `QCOW2`, `VHD`, and `VMDK` disk image formats, as well as raw (unformatted) images.

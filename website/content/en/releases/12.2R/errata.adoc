= FreeBSD {release} Errata

== Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD {release}, containing significant information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD {release} will be maintained until the release of FreeBSD {releaseNext}.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD {release} Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD {releaseBranch} also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

[2020-10-27] A regression in man:ipfw[8] was discovered where packets are not properly forwarded with multiple IP addresses bound to the same interface.

This issue had been corrected in link:https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-20:21.ipfw.asc[FreeBSD-EN-20:21.ipfw].

See link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=250434[PR 250434] for additional details.

[2020-10-27] A regression with man:zfs[8] send/recv was discovered where ZFS snapshots are not properly deleted under certain conditions.

An Errata Notice is planned for 12.2-RELEASE.

See link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=249438[PR 249438] for additional details.

[2020-10-27] A regression was discovered with the FreeBSD/armv7 BEAGLEBONE images where SD card I/O takes an excessive amount of time. As such, there are no BEAGLEBONE images for this release.

[[late-news]]
== Late-Breaking News

[2020-10-27] A very late issue was discovered with the [.filename]#x11/gdm# package included on the amd64 and i386 DVD installer which causes GDM to fail to start properly.

Those installing GNOME as a new installation from the DVD should upgrade [.filename]#x11/gdm# from the upstream man:pkg[8] mirrors after installation.

Those installing GNOME on a new installation from the upstream man:pkg[8] mirrors, or upgrading from a previous FreeBSD release should not experience any issues.

[2020-11-11] Due to slight changes to the ABI and KBI between FreeBSD 12.1 and FreeBSD 12.2, it is important to note that certain third-party kernel modules may need to be rebuilt locally, until FreeBSD 12.1 reaches end of life.

Of note, this includes, but is not limited to, [.filename]#graphics/\*-kmod#, [.filename]#net/*-kmod#, and possibly others that are too extensive to list.

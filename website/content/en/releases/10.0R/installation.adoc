= FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Installation Instructions

== Abstract

This article gives some brief instructions on installing FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE and upgrading the systems running earlier releases.

== Table of Contents

* <<install,Installing FreeBSD>>
* <<upgrade,Upgrading FreeBSD>>

[[install]]
== Installing FreeBSD

The `Installing FreeBSD` chapter of the `FreeBSD Handbook` provides more in-depth information about the installation program itself, including a guided walk-through with screenshots.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading FreeBSD

If you are upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, please read `upgrading section in the Release Notes` for notable incompatibilities carefully.

[[idp61907152]]
== Upgrading from Source

The procedure for doing a source code based update is described in `Synchronizing Source` and `Rebuilding world`.

For SVN use the `releng/10.0` branch which will be where any upcoming Security Advisories or Errata Notices will be applied.

== Upgrading Using "FreeBSD Update"

The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running `7.[34]-RELEASE`, `8.[1234]-RELEASE`, `9.[012]-RELEASE`, `10.0-RC[123]` can upgrade as follows:

----
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
----

Now the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] utility can fetch bits belonging to 10.0-RELEASE. During this process http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] will ask for help in merging configuration files.

----
# freebsd-update upgrade -r 10.0-RELEASE
----

Due to changes in the way that FreeBSD is packaged on the release media, two complications may arise in this process if upgrading from FreeBSD 8.x or 9.x:

[arabic]
. The FreeBSD, which previously could appear in either [.filename]`/boot/kernel` or [.filename]`/boot/GENERIC`, now only appears as [.filename]`/boot/kernel`. As a result, any kernel appearing in [.filename]`/boot/GENERIC` will be deleted. Please carefully read the output printed by http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] and confirm that an updated kernel will be placed into [.filename]`/boot/kernel` before proceeding beyond this point.
. The FreeBSD source tree in [.filename]`/usr/src` (if present) will be deleted. (Normally the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] utility will update a source tree, but in this case the changes in release packaging result in the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] utility not recognizing that the source tree from the old release and the source tree from the new release correspond to the same part of FreeBSD.)

# freebsd-update install

The system must now be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before the non-kernel components are updated.

[.screen]
----
# shutdown -r now
----

After rebooting, http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] needs to be run again to install the new userland components:

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update install
----

At this point, users of systems being upgraded from FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE or earlier will be prompted by http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] to rebuild all third-party applications (e.g., ports installed from the ports tree) due to updates in system libraries.

After updating installed third-party applications (and again, only if http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] printed a message indicating that this was necessary), run http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] again so that it can delete the old (no longer used) system libraries:

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update install
----

Finally, reboot into 10.0-RELEASE

[.screen]
----
# shutdown -r now
----

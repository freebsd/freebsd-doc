= FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Announcement

Date: {thisDate}

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE. This is the first release of the stable/10 branch.

Some of the highlights:

* GCC is no longer installed by default on architectures where clang(1) is the default compiler.
* Unbound has been imported to the base system as the local caching DNS resolver.
* BIND has been removed from the base system.
* make(1) has been replaced with bmake(1), obtained from the NetBSD Project.
* pkg(7) is now the default package management utility.
* pkg_add(1), pkg_delete(1), and related tools have been removed.
* Major enhancements in virtualization, including the addition of bhyve(8), virtio(4), and native paravirtualized drivers providing support for FreeBSD as a guest operating system on Microsoft Hyper-V.
* TRIM support for Solid State Drives has been added to ZFS.
* Support for the high-performance LZ4 compression algorithm has been added to ZFS.

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the online release notes and errata list, available at:

* `http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/10.0R/relnotes/`
* `http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/10.0R/errata/`

== Availability

FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, powerpc64, and sparc64 architectures.

FreeBSD 10.0 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded via FTP as described in the section below. While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures, they will all generally contain the more common ones such as amd64 and i386.

SHA256 and MD5 hashes for the release ISO and memory stick images are included at the bottom of this message.

The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:

*dvd1*: +
This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD operating system, the documentation, and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.

*disc1*: +
This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.

*bootonly*: +
This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not contain the support for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network based install (e.g. from an FTP server) after booting from the CD.

*memstick*: +
This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.

As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:

....
# dd if=FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=10240 conv=sync
....

Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM or DVD from several vendors. One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 10.0-based products is:

* FreeBSD Mall, Inc.`http://www.freebsdmall.com`

== FTP

FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE may be downloaded via ftp from the following site:

* `ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/10.0/`

However before trying this site, please check your regional mirror(s) first by going to:

* `ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD`

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at:

* `link:{handbook}#mirrors-ftp[http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html]`

For instructions on installing FreeBSD or updating an existing machine to 10.0-RELEASE please see:

* `http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/10.0R/installation/`

*Important note to freebsd-update(8) users:* Please be sure to follow the instructions in the following FreeBSD Errata Notices before upgrading the system to 10.0-RELEASE:

== Other Projects Based on FreeBSD

There are many "third party" Projects based on FreeBSD. The Projects range from re-packaging FreeBSD into a more "novice friendly" distribution to making FreeBSD available on Amazon's EC2 infrastructure. For more information about these Third Party Projects see:

* `http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/3rdPartyProjects`

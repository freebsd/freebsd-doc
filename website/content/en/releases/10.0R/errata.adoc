= FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Errata

== Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE, containing significant information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

== Open Issues

* FreeBSD/i386 10.0-RELEASE running as a guest operating system on VirtualBox can have a problem with disk I/O access. It depends on some specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a specific version of VirtualBox or host operating system.
+
It causes various errors and makes FreeBSD quite unstable. Although the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O works as a workaround. To disable it, choose `Escape to loader prompt` in the boot menu and enter the following lines from http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=loader&sektion=8[loader(8)] prompt, after an `OK`:
+
[.screen]
----
set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
boot
----
+
Note that the following line has to be added to `/boot/loader.conf` after a boot. It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:
+
[.programlisting]
----
vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
----
+
[2014-04-03 update] It has been reported that instability may be present on virtual machines running on other hypervisors, such as Xen or KVM.
* A bug in Heimdal (an implementation of Kerberos authentication in FreeBSD base system) has been fixed. It could cause an interoperability issue between Heimdal and the other implementations including MIT Kerberos. However, due to this fix, Heimdal and some applications which depend on it in the previous FreeBSD releases do not work with one in 10.0-RELEASE in certain cases. Errata Notice for the supported releases to fix it will be released.
* A bug in http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=killall&sektion=1[killall(1)] has been discovered. It makes *`killall -INT`* to deliver `SIGTERM` rather than the desired `SIGINT`, and may cause blocking behavior for scripts that uses it, as `-I` means "interactive". A workaround of this would be to use `-SIGINT` instead. This bug has been fixed on FreeBSD-CURRENT and will be fixed in FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.
* The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bxe&sektion=4[bxe(4)] driver can cause packet corruption when TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) feature is enabled. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by using a `-tso` parameter of http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&sektion=8[ifconfig(8)]. It can be specified in http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&sektion=5[rc.conf(5)] like the following:
+
[.programlisting]
----
ifconfig_bxe0="DHCP -tso"
----
+
This bug has been fixed on FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

* Due to a minor incompatibility with http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=7[pkg(7)] version `1.2.x`, http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdconfig&sektion=8[bsdconfig(8)] will duplicate the list of available packages for installation. This is due to the `PACKAGESITE` environment variable being set for backwards compatibility with older versions of http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=7[pkg(7)]. This affects generation of the available package list only, and does not affect the behavior when processing packages for installation.

* A regression in http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pw&sektion=8[pw(8)] does not remove a user from groups not specified in the provided group list when the `-G` flag is used. This is expected to be corrected in FreeBSD-CURRENT and FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

* http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8[ipfw(8)] `fwd` action can send packets to the correct interface with a wrong link-layer address when the route is updated. This bug has been fixed on FreeBSD-CURRENT and will be fixed in FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

* The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_udf&sektion=8[mount_udf(8)] utility has a bug which prevents it from mounting any UDF file system. This has been fixed in FreeBSD-CURRENT and FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

* Updating LSI firmware on http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mps&sektion=4[mps(4)] controllers with the sas2flash utility may cause the system to hang, or may cause the system to panic. This is fixed in the `stable/10` branch with revisions `r262553` and `r262575`, and will be included in FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.

= FreeBSD 2.1.7 Announcement

FreeBSD 2.1.7 is now available in:

____
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.7-RELEASE
____

And shortly from its various mirror sites, a list of which may be obtained from: http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html

This is a security release to FreeBSD 2.1.6, fixing at least several security holes and addressing a number of outstanding problem reports in that release.

FreeBSD 2.1.7 will also be available on CDROM from http://www.cdrom.com/[Walnut Creek CDROM], hopefully shipping within the next 3-4 weeks. If you are a customer of Walnut Creek CDROM and you purchased the 2.1.6 release (either by subscription or by retail) then you are also entitled to a *free upgrade*. All you need to do is send mail to orders@cdrom.com or call 1-800 786-9907 / +1 510 674-0783 Intl, indicate that you would like the free 2.1.7 upgrade and provide your name and address information so that a replacement can be shipped. Walnut Creek CDROM customers will also receive a letter explaining these details.

Those puzzled by the near-simultaneous release of 2.1.7 and 2.2 should also look at http://www.FreeBSD.org/ for the reasons behind this release schedule. CDROM subscription customers should see this page for information on Walnut Creek CDROM's plans for these releases.

If you are a commercial user of FreeBSD who would like to take advantage of recent bug fixes without making the jump to our more ambitious 2.2 release (or delay that jump until 2.2 has had more time to mature), or if you're simply looking for the lowest-impact upgrade from 2.1.5, then 2.1.7-RELEASE is for you.

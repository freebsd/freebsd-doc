= FreeBSD 3.1 Announcement

*Date:* Mon, 15 Feb 1999 12:00:03 -0700 +
*From:* "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freebsd.org> +
**Subject:**FreeBSD 3.1 is now released!

We are pleased, as always, to announce the availability of 3.1-RELEASE, the much anticipated follow-on release to FreeBSD 3.0 (released November, 1998). Many hundreds of bug fixes and general enhancements have been made to the system so please see the link:notes.html[release notes] for more information.

FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE is available on ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD[ftp.freebsd.org] and various https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html[FTP mirror sites] throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.cdrom.com/[Walnut Creek CDROM], from where it will be shipping shortly as a 4 CD set containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to programmers and general users alike.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: All of the profits from the sales of this CD set go to support the FreeBSD Project!

Like many businesses in the field of high-tech, Walnut Creek CDROM has realized that in order to make any product for an emerging market grow, you have to make a significant investment in such growth, even if it means abandoning short-term profits. Walnut Creek CDROM is the only CDROM vendor who currently does anything like this and it's certainly my hope that you will help support the project by buying (or getting someone else to buy :) one of their CDs. Thanks!

This is my current TODO list for 1.1.5.  Please feel free to add to
it, assuming that you've actually got some confidence that you or
someone else will be able to actually get to whatever it is (or it's
so critical that you don't think 1.1.5 could/should be released
without it).

Also, please bear in mind the following milestones we have to hit:

June 5th	Feature Freeze (bug fixes and cleanup work only).
June 16th	Code Freeze
June 20th	Roll binaries - begin initial testing
June 23rd	Announce availability of 1.1.5.

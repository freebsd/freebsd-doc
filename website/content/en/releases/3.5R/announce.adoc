= FreeBSD 3.5 Announcement

*Date:* Sat, 24 Jun 2000 18:23:01 -0700 +
*From:* "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freebsd.org> +
**Subject:**FreeBSD 3.5 now available for x86

I'm pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 3.5-RELEASE, the very LAST in 3.x-STABLE branch technology. Following the release of FreeBSD 3.4 in December, 1999, many bugs were fixed, important security issues dealt with, and even a few new features added. Please see the link:../notes[release notes] for more information.

FreeBSD 3.5-RELEASE is available at ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/[ftp.FreeBSD.org] and various https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html[FTP mirror sites] throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.FreeBSDMall.com/[The FreeBSD Mall], from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set containing installation bits for x86 architecture, as well as a lot of other material of general interest to programmers and end-users alike

We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the rather large installation (660MB) image, but it will at least be available from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/3.5-install.iso

along with the more traditional 3.5-RELEASE bits. If you can't afford the CDs, are impatient, or just want to use it for evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO, otherwise please do continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing one of its official CD releases from BSDi.

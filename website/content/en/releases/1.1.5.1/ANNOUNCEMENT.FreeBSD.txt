This is a convenience release targeted primarily at people who have
not yet upgraded to FreeBSD 1.1.5R.  It fixes a couple of trivial but
annoying problems in the release process (not the sources themselves).

gatekeeper.dec.com:~ftp/pub/BSD/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-1.1.5.1-RELEASE

Those who have already upgraded to 1.1.5R should read the
`WHATS_NEW-1.1.5.1' file for information on what steps to take to come
up to the level of 1.1.5.1R (they're very simple, don't panic).

Thanks!

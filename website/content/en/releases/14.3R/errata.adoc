[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD {release}.
Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release.
These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD {releaseBranch} also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* When "restarting" the FreeBSD installation process, some values are remembered and not re-prompted.

* The installer produces a non-booting system in the (non-default) combination of MBR and ZFS.

* SCTP can use deprecated addresses even when `net.inet6.ip6.use_deprecated` is set to zero (non-default).

* Unloading the `snd_dummy` kernel module can cause a kernel panic.

* Some wifi drivers fail to connect to networks using the (long-deprecated) TKIP protocol.

[[late-287482]]
The ZFS raw virtual machine image for AMD64 is prone to kernel panics (link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=287482[bug 287482]).
`FreeBSD-14.3-RELEASE-amd64-zfs.raw.xz` has been removed from download.freebsd.org but remains available for reference on archive.freebsd.org.
Torrents of the file should be avoided.

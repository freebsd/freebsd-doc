= FreeBSD 4.1.1 Announcement

*Date:* Wed, 27 Sep 2000 00:07:50 -070 +
*From:* "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@zippy.osd.bsdi.com> +
*To:* announce@FreeBSD.org +
*Subject:* 4.1.1-RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org

As always, I'm pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 4.1.1-RELEASE, a point release update for 4.1-RELEASE and, of course, the very latest in 4.x-STABLE branch technology.

Since 4.1-RELEASE was produced in August 2000, RSA released their code into the public domain and a number of other security enhancements were made possible through the FreeBSD project's permission to export cryptographic code from the United States. These changes are fully reflected in 4.1.1-RELEASE, making it one of the most secure "out of the box" releases of FreeBSD we've ever done.

We also took the opportunity to include support for new features like IDE ATA100 support, drivers for additional Gigabit ethernet cards and hardware watchpoints in gdb. Please see the release notes for more information.

The 4.1.1-RELEASE is available right now for the ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE[i386] architecture (alpha to follow in several days) in "FTP installable" and ISO image form. For the appropriate bits, please see:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE/ +
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso

When the Alpha release follows in several days, it will be available from:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.1.1-RELEASE/ +
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso

Please watch the mailto:alpha@FreeBSD.org[alpha@freebsd.org] mailing list for an announcement.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* This is a network only point release and will not be made generally available for sale on CDROM, at least not from BSDi or anyone else we currently have knowledge of. The next official CD release will be FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, still scheduled for mid-November 2000.

FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Elbonia, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom (and quite possibly several others which I've never even heard of :).

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s) first by going to:

....
  ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

Thanks! - Jordan

= FreeBSD 1.0 Announcement

From: jkh@whisker.lotus.ie (Jordan K. Hubbard) +

Subject: FreeBSD 1.0 RELEASE now available +
Date: 1 Nov 1993 16:12:20 -0800

The first "official" release of FreeBSD 1.0 is now available, no more greek letters - this is the "production" release.

While a fair number of bugs were also whacked between EPSILON and RELEASE, the following additional features deserve special mention:

* A dynamic buffer cache mechanism that automagically grows and shrinks as you use the memory for other things. This should speed up disk operations significantly.
* The Linux sound driver for Gravis UltraSound, SoundBlaster, etc. cards.
* Mitsumi CDROM interface and drive.
* Updated install floppies.
* More fail-safe probing of devices on the ISA bus. This makes it much harder for devices to conflict with each other.
* Advance syscons support for XFree86 2.0.

For more information, please read the release notes.

FreeBSD 1.0 RELEASE may be obtained by ftp on freebsd.cdrom.com, and on its various mirror sites within a day or so.

Thanks, as usual, to all the kind individuals on the net who aided us significantly bu finding bugs, contributing fixes and just generally lending moral support. Thank You!

Also, continuing thanks to Walnut Creek CDROM who's ongoing (and, up to now, profitless) support has made this all possible.

Questions, as usual, should be sent to "freebsd-questions@freefall.cdrom.com". Bug reports to "freebsd-bugs@freefall.cdrom.com" and general technical commentary to "freebsd-hackers@freefall.cdrom.com".

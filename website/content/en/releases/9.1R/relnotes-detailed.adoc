[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

This distribution of FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE is a release distribution. It can be found at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}#mirrors/["Obtaining FreeBSD" appendix] to the link:{handbook}[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with “late-breaking” information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

[[new]]
== What's New

This section describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since 9.0-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after 9.0-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[kernel]]
=== Kernel Changes

The FreeBSD Jail subsystem now supports mounting man:devfs[5], man:nullfs[5], and ZFS filesystem inside a jail. New man:jail[8] parameters `allow.mount.devfs`, `allow.mount.nullfs`, and `allow.mount.zfs` to control the per-jail capabilities have been added. All of them are disabled by default.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=232728[r232728]

A new man:loader[8] tunable `kern.eventtimer.activetick` has been added. This tunable specifies whether each hardclock tick should be run on every active CPU or only one. By setting it to `0`, the total number of interrupts can be reduced on SMP machines. The default value is `1`.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234167[r234167]

The man:posix_fadvise[2] system call has been implemented. This is a function similar to man:madvise[2] except that it operates on a file descriptor instead of a memory region.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229723[r229723]

The man:filemon[4] pseudo-device has been added. This allows a process to collect file operations data of its children.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=237795[r237795]

The man:sysctl[8] variable `kern.stop_scheduler_on_panic` is now set to `1` by default.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235413[r235413]

[powerpc] FreeBSD/powerpc64 now supports kernel profiling by using man:kgmon[8].[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=231907[r231907]

The FreeBSD Linux ABI compatibility layer now supports the `linux_fadvise64()` and `linux_fadvise64_64()` system calls.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=231145[r231145]

The default value of the man:loader[8] tunable `hw.memtest.tests` is now automatically set to `0` when FreeBSD is running on a virtual machine.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230266[r230266]

A new man:loader[8] tunable `kern.msgbuf_show_timestamp` has been added. When it is enabled, a timestamp is added to each line of the system message buffer. The default value is `0` (disabled).[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234075[r234075]

The man:null[4] and man:zero[4] pseudo device driver now supports non-blocking mode via the man:fcntl[2] system call.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230320[r230320]

The FreeBSD man:sched_ule[4] scheduler has been improved for CPU load balancing on SMT (Simultaneous MultiThreading) CPUs. It gives a 10-15% performance improvement when the number of threads is lesser than the number of logical CPUs.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=233599[r233599]

[sparc64] The `PREEMPTION` kernel option is now enabled in the `GENERIC` kernel.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235992[r235992]

A new man:sysctl[8] variable `security.bsd.unprivileged_idprio` has been added. This variable controls whether non-root users can set an idle priority or not. This is disabled by default.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230039[r230039]

The man:splash[4] screen interface now supports ASCII art in *TheDraw* format.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=228445[r228445]

'''''

[[boot]]
==== Boot Loader Changes

The man:boot0cfg[8] utility now supports configuration of PXE boot via the `boot0` boot block temporarily on the next boot. The slice number `6` or a keyword `PXE` can be specified to enable PXE boot using the `-s` option.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230065[r230065]

The FreeBSD man:boot[8] block now supports `/boot/config` in addition to `/boot.config` as the boot block parameter file. When both of them exist, the former will be used.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=231287[r231287]

The `gptboot` boot block now reads the backup GPT header from the last LBA only when the primary GPT header and tables are invalid. This mitigates interoperability issues with some man:geom[4] providers like `MIRROR` which use the last LBA for the metadata.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234693[r234693]

The `zfsboot` boot block and `zfsloader` support filesystems within a ZFS storage pool. In `zfsloader`, the ZFS device name format is now `zfs:pool`/`fs` and the fully qualified file path format is `zfs:pool`/`fs`:/`path/to/file`. The `zfsboot` boot block accepts the kernel/loader name in the format `pool`:`fs`:`path/to/file` or, as before, `pool`:`path/to/file`. In the latter case a default filesystem is used (the pool root or a filesystem with the `bootfs` property). The `zfsboot` boot block passes the GUIDs of the selected storage pool and dataset to `zfsloader` to be used as its defaults.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=237766[r237766]

[sparc64] FreeBSD/sparc64 now supports booting from ZFS via the `zfsboot` boot block and `zfsloader`. For example, the following commands create a mirrored storage pool `rpool` consisting of `da0a` and `da0b` and configure the storage pool as the root filesystem:[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=236076[r236076]

==== File Systems

The FreeBSD NFS filesystem has been improved:

* It now supports a timeout on positive name cache entries on the client side. A new mount option `nametimeo` has been added and set to `60` (in seconds) by default.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=233326[r233326]
* A memory leak when a ZFS volume is exported via the FreeBSD NFS server has been fixed.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234740[r234740]
* A bug has been fixed. When a process writes to an mmap-backed file on an NFS filesystem, flushing changes to the data could fail under some circumstances such as errors due to permission mismatch, and this failure could not be detected as an error. A new man:sysctl[8] variable `vfs.nfs.nfs_keep_dirty_on_error` has been added to control the behavior on the client side related to this issue. When this is set to `1`, the pages where a write operation failed are kept dirty. The default value is set to `0`.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=233730[r233730]
* The man:nfsv4[4] filesystem now supports a man:sysctl[8] variable `vfs.nfsd.disable_checkutf8`. This disables the check for UTF-8 compliance in filenames. This is disabled by default. Note that enabling this may help wht some interoperability issues but results in an NFSv4 server that is not RFC 3530 compliant.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229799[r229799]

The man:tmpfs[5] filesystem is not an experimental implementation anymore.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234511[r234511]

The man:tmpfs[5] filesystem now supports a man:sysctl[8] variable `vfs.tmpfs.memory_reserved` to set the amount of required free pages when man:tmpfs[5] attempts to allocate a new node.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234849[r234849]

FreeBSD's ZFS filesystem has been updated by merging improvements from the illumos project. The following changes are made:[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229578[r229578], http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=232328[r232328]

* New properties, `clones` and `written`, have been added.
* The man:zfs[8] `send` command now reports an estimated size of the stream.
* The man:zfs[8] `destroy` command now reports an estimate of the space which would be reclaimed, when `-n` is specified.
* The man:zfs[8] `get` command now supports the `-t type` flag to specify the data type.

A simple script `zfsboottest.sh` has been added to the source tree. This checks if the system is configured correctly when using ZFS as the root filesystem. The script is located at `/usr/src/tools/tools/zfsboottest.sh` and it uses the `zfsboottest` binary program in the same directory.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=227705[r227705]

The binary program can be built and installed by the following command:

[source,screen]
----
# cd /usr/src/tools/tools/zfsboottest
# make
# make install
----

After that, the following command can be used to check the system. `poolname` is the ZFS storage pool name to boot:

[source,screen]
----
# sh /usr/src/tools/tools/zfsboottest/zfsboottest.sh poolname
----

The man:sysctl[8] variable `vfs.zfs.txg.timeout` has been changed from read-only to writable.

=== Userland Changes

man:auth.conf[5] has been removed because it was deprecated years ago.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=238481[r238481]

The man:camcontrol[8] utility now supports a `fwdownload` subcommand for firmware update on SCSI devices from Hitachi, HP, IBM, Plextor, Quantum, and Seagate. This subcommand will reprogram the firmware on devices connected over an ATA/SATA transport.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=237740[r237740]

The man:dhclient[8] utility now supports `domain-search` (option number 119, described in RFC 3397). This allows a DHCP server to publish a list of implicit domain suffixes used during name lookup. If this option is specified, a `search` keyword will be added to `/etc/resolv.conf`.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230597[r230597]

The man:dump[8] utility now uses 53 characters for the device names in `/etc/dumpdates`. This was previously limited to 32 characters.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230047[r230047]

The man:fopen[3] function now supports the `x` (an exclusive create-and-open mode) option in the ISO/IEC 9899:2011 and C11 standards.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229845[r229845]

A bug in the man:gcc[1] compiler has been fixed. It could lead to incorrect calculations when `-ffast-math` is specified.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234023[r234023]

The man:hastd[8] daemon now supports specifying the filename of its process ID file in man:hast.conf[5].[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229509[r229509]

The man:ifconfig[8] utility now supports a `vlanhwcsum` parameter to set or reset checksum offloading capability on VLANs.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=231221[r231221]

A bug in the man:ifconfig[8] utility which could display an error message in a jail with no IPv6 support has been fixed.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=238872[r238872]

The man:ifconfig[8] utility now supports a `carp state state` parameter to set the state to `backup` or `master` forcibly.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=232486[r232486]

The man:jail[8] utility now supports a configuration file (man:jail.conf[5]) for complex configurations.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235839[r235839]

The man:kenv[1] utility now supports a `-v` flag to display an entry in `name=value` format, and a `-N` flag to display only the name.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=236118[r236118]

The man:kldload[8] utility now supports a `-n` flag to ignore the error status when the specified module is already loaded.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=233560[r233560]

*libedit* has been updated to a NetBSD snapshot as of 28 December, 2009.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=237738[r237738]

man:libmap.conf[5] now supports `include` and `includedir` directives. They allow to include specified files for the configuration.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=236523[r236523]

Lock handling performance in the *libthr* pthread library has been improved. It now works 10 times faster especially under the condition that a mutex is heavily contested.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234372[r234372]

A new {cpp} stack has been imported. This consists of *libcxxrt*, originally developed by a FreeBSD developer under contract by PathScale and open sourced by the FreeBSD and NetBSD foundations, and *libc++* from the LLVM project. *libcxxrt* is a drop-in replacement for GNU *libsupc++*, which implements the {cpp} runtime support for features such as run-time type information, dynamic casting, thread-safe static initializer, and exceptions. *libc++* implements the {cpp}11 standard library, and will replace GNU *libstdc++* in a future release. In 9.1-RELEASE, *libstdc++* is still installed as standard and now dynamically links against *libsupc++*. This allows libraries linking *libstdc++* and *libc++* to both be used in the same program, to aid migration.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235798[r235798]

The man:limits[1] utility now supports a `-P pid` option to control limits for the specified process.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230919[r230919]

The man:pciconf[8] utility now supports a `-e` flag to display PCI error details in listing mode. When this is specified, the status of any error bits in the PCI status register and PCI-express device status register will be displayed. It also lists any errors indicated by version 1 of PCI-express Advanced Error Reporting (AER).[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=237731[r237731]

The man:procstat[1] utility now shows the superpage mapping flag when displaying process virtual memory mappings.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=229710[r229710]

The man:procstat[1] utility now supports an `-e` flag to display process environment variables, an `-x` flag to display ELF auxiliary vectors, and an `-l` flag to display resource limits.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230917[r230917], http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=230918[r230918]

A bug in the man:remquo[3] functions where the quotient did not always have the correct sign when the remainder was `0`, and another bug that the remainder and quotient were both off by a bit in certain cases involving subnormal remainders, have been fixed. Note that these bugs affected all platforms except amd64 and i386.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234535[r234535]

The man:rtld[1] run-time linker now supports GCC's RELRO (RElocation Read-Only). This prevents the GOT (Global Offset Table) from being overwritten.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=231579[r231579]

The man:rtld[1] run-time linker now supports a GNU hash section (`DT_GNU_HASH`), which is a replacement of optional ELF hash section.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235396[r235396]

The man:setbuf[1] utility and *libstdbuf* library have been added. This controls the default buffering behavior of standard stdio streams.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235139[r235139]

The man:top[1] utility now correctly supports per-thread I/O statistics of ZFS in the `-m 	io` option.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=227702[r227702]

The man:unzip[1] utility now supports a `-Z` option for zipinfo.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=234330[r234330]

The man:xlocale[3] API has been implemented. This consists of `_l`-suffixed versions of various standard library functions that use the global locale, making them take an explicit locale parameter and allowing thread-safe extended locale support. Most of these APIs are required for IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX.1-2008 or ISO/IEC 9945:2009) compatibility, and are required by *libc++* and recent versions of *GNOME*. This implementation also supports several extensions for compatibility with Apple *Darwin*.[http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base?view=revision&revision=235785[r235785]

== Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD

[[AEN1113]]
=== Upgrading using man:freebsd-update[8] or a source-based procedure

[amd64, i386] Beginning with FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as an unmodified `GENERIC` kernel, distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported using to the instructions in `/usr/src/UPDATING`.

For more specific information about upgrading instructions, see http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/9.1R/installation/.


*Important:* Upgrading FreeBSD should, of course, only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.

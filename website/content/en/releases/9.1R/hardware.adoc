[[INTRO]]
== Introduction

This document contains the hardware compatibility notes for FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE. It lists the hardware platforms supported by FreeBSD, as well as the various types of hardware devices (storage controllers, network interfaces, and so on), along with known working instances of these devices.

[[PROC]]
== Supported Processors and System Boards

This section provides some architecture-specific information about the specific processors and systems that are supported by each architecture.

'''''

[[PROC-AMD64]]
=== amd64

Since mid-2003 FreeBSD/amd64 has supported the AMD64 (“Hammer”) and Intel(R) EM64T architecture, and is now one of the Tier-1 platforms (fully supported architecture), which are expected to be Production Quality with respects to all aspects of the FreeBSD operating system, including installation and development environments.

Note that there are two names for this architecture, AMD64 (AMD) and Intel EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology). 64-bit mode of the two architectures are almost compatible with each other, and FreeBSD/amd64 should support them both.

As of this writing, the following processors are supported:

* AMD Athlon(TM)64 (“Clawhammer”).
* AMD Opteron(TM) (“Sledgehammer”).
* All multi-core Intel Xeon(TM) processors except Sossaman have EM64T support.
* The single-core Intel Xeon processors “Nocona”, “Irwindale”, “Potomac”, and “Cranford” have EM64T support.
* All Intel Core 2 (not Core Duo) and later processors
* All Intel Pentium(R) D processors
* Intel Pentium 4s and Celeron Ds using the “Cedar Mill” core have EM64T support.
* Some Intel Pentium 4s and Celeron Ds using the “Prescott” core have EM64T support. See the http://processorfinder.intel.com[Intel Processor Spec Finder] for the definitive answer about EM64T support in Intel processors.

Intel EM64T is an extended version of IA-32 (x86) and different from Intel IA-64 (Itanium) architecture, which FreeBSD/ia64 supports. Some Intel's old documentation refers to Intel EM64T as “64-bit extension technology” or “IA-32e”.

The largest tested memory configuration to date is 64GB. SMP support has been recently completed and is reasonably robust.

In many respects, FreeBSD/amd64 is similar to FreeBSD/i386, in terms of drivers supported. There may be some issues with 64-bit cleanliness in some (particularly older) drivers. Generally, drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit platforms should work.

FreeBSD/amd64 is a very young platform on FreeBSD. While the core FreeBSD kernel and base system components are generally fairly robust, there are likely to still be rough edges, particularly with third party packages.

'''''

[[PROC-I386]]
=== i386

FreeBSD/i386 runs on a wide variety of “IBM PC compatible” machines. Due to the wide range of hardware available for this architecture, it is impossible to exhaustively list all combinations of equipment supported by FreeBSD. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are presented here.

Almost all i386(TM)-compatible processors with a floating point unit are supported. All Intel processors beginning with the 80486 are supported, including the 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4, and variants thereof, such as the Xeon and Celeron(R) processors. All i386-compatible AMD processors are also supported, including the Am486(R), Am5x86(R), K5, AMD-K6(R) (and variants), AMD Athlon (including Athlon-MP, Athlon-XP, Athlon-4, and Athlon Thunderbird), and AMD Duron(TM) processors. The AMD Élan SC520 embedded processor is supported. The Transmeta Crusoe is recognized and supported, as are i386-compatible processors from Cyrix and NexGen.

There is a wide variety of motherboards available for this architecture. Motherboards using the ISA, VLB, EISA, AGP, and PCI expansion busses are well-supported. There is some limited support for the MCA (“MicroChannel”) expansion bus used in the IBM PS/2 line of PCs.

Symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems are generally supported by FreeBSD, although in some cases, BIOS or motherboard bugs may generate some problems. Perusal of the archives of the http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-smp[FreeBSD symmetric multiprocessing mailing list] may yield some clues.

FreeBSD will take advantage of HyperThreading (HTT) support on Intel CPUs that support this feature. A kernel with the `options SMP` feature enabled will automatically detect the additional logical processors. The default FreeBSD scheduler treats the logical processors the same as additional physical processors; in other words, no attempt is made to optimize scheduling decisions given the shared resources between logical processors within the same CPU. Because this naive scheduling can result in suboptimal performance, under certain circumstances it may be useful to disable the logical processors with the `machdep.hyperthreading_allowed` tunable. The man:smp[4] manual page has more details.

FreeBSD will take advantage of Physical Address Extensions (PAE) support on CPUs that support this feature. A kernel with the `PAE` feature enabled will detect memory above 4 gigabytes and allow it to be used by the system. This feature places constraints on the device drivers and other features of FreeBSD which may be used; consult the man:pae[4]manpage for more details.

FreeBSD will generally run on i386-based laptops, albeit with varying levels of support for certain hardware features such as sound, graphics, power management, and PCCARD expansion slots. These features tend to vary in idiosyncratic ways between machines, and frequently require special-case support in FreeBSD to work around hardware bugs or other oddities. When in doubt, a search of the archives of the http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-mobile[FreeBSD laptop computer mailing list] may be useful.

Most modern laptops (as well as many desktops) use the Advanced Configuration and Power Management (ACPI) standard. FreeBSD supports ACPI via the ACPI Component Architecture reference implementation from Intel, as described in the man:acpi[4] manual page. The use of ACPI causes instabilities on some machines and it may be necessary to disable the ACPI driver, which is normally loaded via a kernel module. This may be accomplished by adding the following line to `/boot/device.hints`:

[source,shell]
----
hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
----

Users debugging ACPI-related problems may find it useful to disable portions of the ACPI functionality. The man:acpi[4] manual page has more information on how to do this via loader tunables.

ACPI depends on a Differentiated System Descriptor Table (DSDT) provided by each machine's BIOS. Some machines have bad or incomplete DSDTs, which prevents ACPI from functioning correctly. Replacement DSDTs for some machines can be found at the http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php[DSDT] section of the http://acpi.sourceforge.net/[ACPI4Linux] project Web site. FreeBSD can use these DSDTs to override the DSDT provided by the BIOS; see the man:acpi[4] manual page for more information.

[[PROC-IA64]]
=== ia64

Currently supported processors are the http://people.freebsd.org/~marcel/refs/ia64/itanium/24532003.pdf[Itanium(R)] and the http://people.freebsd.org/~marcel/refs/ia64/itanium2/25111003.pdf[[Itanium 2].

Supported chipsets include:

* HP zx1
* Intel 460GX
* Intel E8870

Both Uniprocessor (UP) and Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP) configurations are supported.

Most devices that can be found in or are compatible with ia64 machines are fully supported. The notable exception is the VGA console. The FreeBSD support for VGA consoles is at this time too much based on PC hardware and not all ia64 machines have chipsets that provide sufficient PC legacy support. As such man:syscons[4] can not be enabled and the use of a serial console is required.

'''''

[[PROC-PC98]]
=== pc98

NEC PC-9801/9821 series with almost all i386-compatible processors, including 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and variants. All i386-compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix, IBM, and IDT are also supported.

NEC FC-9801/9821 series, and NEC SV-98 series (both of them are compatible with PC-9801/9821 series) should be supported.

EPSON PC-386/486/586 series, which are compatible with NEC PC-9801 series are supported.

High-resolution mode is not supported. NEC PC-98XA/XL/RL/XL^2, and NEC PC-H98 series are supported in normal (PC-9801 compatible) mode only.

Although there are some multi-processor systems (such as Rs20/B20), SMP-related features of FreeBSD are not supported yet.

PC-9801/9821 standard bus (called C-Bus), PC-9801NOTE expansion bus (110pin), and PCI bus are supported. New Extend Standard Architecture (NESA) bus (used in PC-H98, SV-H98, and FC-H98 series) is not supported.

[[SUPPORT]]
== Supported Devices

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by FreeBSD. Other configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested yet. Feedback, updates, and corrections to this list are encouraged.

Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class of devices is listed. If the driver in question has a manual page in the FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here. Information on specific models of supported devices, controllers, etc. can be found in the manual pages.

The device lists in this document are being generated automatically from FreeBSD manual pages. This means that some devices, which are supported by multiple drivers, may appear multiple times.

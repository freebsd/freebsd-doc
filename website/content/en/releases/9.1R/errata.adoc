[[late-news]]
== Late-Breaking News

[November 2, 2012] The current man:mfi[4] driver has an overflow bug when handling disks larger than 2^32 sectors in SYSPD volumes, also known as JBODs, which will cause data corruption. This bug has been fixed on this FreeBSD-CURRENT but was too late for inclusion in this release. An Errata Notice for 9.1-RELEASE is planned.

[December 25, 2012] The Installtion Instructions had the following wrong information about upgrading procedure. All of them have been fixed in the online version.

* The link URL of “upgrading section in the Release Notes”, branch names where upcoming Security Advisories or Errata Notices will be applied, and a command line argument of man:freebsd-update[8] were ones for 9.0-RELEASE, not for 9.1-RELEASE.
* The list of releases supported by man:freebsd-update[8] utility were incorrect. For 9.X, The following versions are supported: `9.0-RELEASE`, `9.1-BETA1`, and `9.1-RC[123]`.

      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security

      a post-procfs world.  Dag-Erling Sm&oslash;rgrav had prototype patches; Robert Drehmel

      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,

      substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the
      inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel
      objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional
      compilation in the kernel modules.  In order to improve build
      performance and better support options of this sort, the
      KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped.  Peter Wemm has
      done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before
      starting on this work.</td>

  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>

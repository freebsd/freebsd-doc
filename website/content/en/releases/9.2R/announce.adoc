Date: {thisDate}

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE. This is the second release from the stable/9 branch, which improves on the stability of FreeBSD 9.1 and introduces some new features. Some of the highlights:

* The ZFS filesystem now supports TRIM when used on solid state drives.
* The virtio(4) drivers have been added to the GENERIC kernel configuration for amd64 and i386 architectures.
* The ZFS filesystem now supports lz4 compression.
* OpenSSL has been updated to version 0.9.8y.
* DTrace hooks have been enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel.
* DTrace has been updated to version 1.9.0.
* Sendmail has been updated to version 8.14.7.
* OpenSSH has been updated to version 6.2p2.
* Import unmapped I/O support from head/.

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the online release notes and errata list, available at:

* `http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/9.2R/relnotes/`

== Availability

FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, powerpc64, and sparc64 architectures.

FreeBSD 9.2 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded via FTP as described in the section below. While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures, they will all generally contain the more common ones such as amd64 and i386.

MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO and memory stick images are included at the bottom of this message.

The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:

dvd1::
This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD operating system, the documentation, and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.
disc1::
This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
bootonly::
This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not contain the support for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network based install (e.g. from an FTP server) after booting from the CD.
memstick::
This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.
+
As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:
+
....
# dd if=FreeBSD-9.2-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=10240 conv=sync
....
+
Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM or DVD from several vendors. One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 9.2-based products is:

* FreeBSD Mall, Inc.`http://www.freebsdmall.com`

== FTP

At the time of this announcement the following FTP sites have FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE available.

* `ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/9.2/`

However before trying these sites please check your regional mirror(s) first by going to:

* `ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD`

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at:

* `http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html`

For instructions on installing FreeBSD or updating an existing machine to 9.2-RELEASE please see:

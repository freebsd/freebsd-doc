= FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE Errata

== Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE, containing significant information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of FreeBSD 11.4-STABLE (if applicable).

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.3-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* [2019-07-04] An issue which can cause a crash when connecting to a https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&sektion=4&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[bhyve(4)] instance with a VNC client under certain circumstances had been reported. An errata notice is planned post-release.
* [2019-07-04] An issue booting https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&sektion=4&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[bhyve(4)] virtual machines compiled with https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&sektion=1&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[clang(1)] version 8.0.0 or later had been reported late in the release cycle. An errata notice is planned post-release.
+
This issue is believed to only affect OpenBSD virtual machines compiled with https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&sektion=1&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[clang(1)].
* [2019-07-04] An issue when upgrading from FreeBSD 11.3 to FreeBSD 12.0 (which occurred earlier in time, comparatively), had been reported where the `com.delphix:spacemap_v2` https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zpool&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[zpool(8)] feature does not exist on FreeBSD 12.0, will fail to import the ZFS pool.
+
At this time, it is advised to defer migrating from FreeBSD 11.3 to FreeBSD 12.x until FreeBSD 12.1 is available.
+
Upgrading from earlier FreeBSD 11.x releases to FreeBSD 12.0 are believed to be unaffected.

[[late-news]]
== Late-Breaking News

* [2019-12-06] An issue has been reported with the FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE images on the Google Compute Engine platform which causes virtual machines to fail to start properly.
+
While we intend to investigate how to handle similar situations should they arise in the future, updated images will not be provided as of this time.
+
Users wanting to use FreeBSD in Google Compute Engine are advised to use 12.0-RELEASE or 12.1-RELEASE, or for those who wish to track 11._`X`_, the `freebsd-11-3-stable-amd64-v20190801` snapshot from `stable/11` has been https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/359#issuecomment-519314652[reported to work correctly].

[[install]]
== Installing FreeBSD

The `Installing FreeBSD` chapter of the `FreeBSD Handbook` provides more in-depth information about the installation program itself, including a guided walk-through with screenshots.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading FreeBSD

If you are upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, please read `upgrading section in the Release Notes` for notable incompatibilities carefully.

[[upgrade-source]]
== Upgrading from Source

The procedure for doing a source code based update is described in `Synchronizing Source` and `Rebuilding world`.

For SVN use the `releng/11.3` branch which will be where any upcoming Security Advisories or Errata Notices will be applied.

[[upgrade-binary]]
== Upgrading Using "FreeBSD Update"

The https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[freebsd-update(8)] utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running `11.2-RELEASE` can upgrade as follows:

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
----

Now the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] utility can fetch bits belonging to 11.3-RELEASE. During this process http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8[freebsd-update(8)] will ask for help in merging configuration files.

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update upgrade -r 11.3-RELEASE
----

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update install
----

The system must now be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before the non-kernel components are updated.

[.screen]
----
# shutdown -r now
----

After rebooting, http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[freebsd-update(8)] needs to be run again to install the new userland components:

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update install
----

At this point, users of systems being upgraded from earlier FreeBSD releases will be prompted by http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[freebsd-update(8)] to rebuild all third-party applications (e.g., ports installed from the ports tree) due to updates in system libraries.

After updating installed third-party applications (and again, only if http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[freebsd-update(8)] printed a message indicating that this was necessary), run http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-release-ports[freebsd-update(8)] again so that it can delete the old (no longer used) system libraries:

[.screen]
----
# freebsd-update install
----

Finally, reboot into 11.3-RELEASE

[.screen]
----
# shutdown -r now
----

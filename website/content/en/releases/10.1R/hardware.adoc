[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the hardware compatibility notes for FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE. It lists the hardware platforms supported by FreeBSD, as well as the various types of hardware devices (storage controllers, network interfaces, and so on), along with known working instances of these devices.

[[proc]]
== 2. Supported Processors and System Boards

This section provides some architecture-specific information about the specific processors and systems that are supported by each architecture.

[[proc-amd64]]
== 2.1. amd64

Since mid-2003 FreeBSD/amd64 has supported the AMD64 ("Hammer") and Intel(R) EM64T architecture, and is now one of the Tier-1 platforms (fully supported architecture), which are expected to be Production Quality with respects to all aspects of the FreeBSD operating system, including installation and development environments.

Note that there are two names for this architecture, AMD64 (AMD) and Intel EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology). 64-bit mode of the two architectures are almost compatible with each other, and FreeBSD/amd64 supports them both.

As of this writing, the following processors are supported:

* AMD Athlon(TM)64 ("Clawhammer").
* AMD Opteron(TM) ("Sledgehammer").
* AMD Sempron(TM).
* AMD Turion(TM).
* AMD Phenom(TM).
* All multi-core Intel(R) Xeon(TM) processors except Sossaman have EM64T support.
* The single-core Intel(R) Xeon(TM) processors "Nocona", "Irwindale", "Potomac", and "Cranford" have EM64T support.
* All Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 (not Core(TM) Duo) and later processors
* All Intel(R) Core(TM) i range of processors
* All Intel(R) Pentium(R) D processors
* All Intel(R) Centrino(R) Duo and Centrino(R) Pro platforms
* Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4s and (R)Celeron(R) Ds using the "Cedar Mill" core have EM64T support.
* Some Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4s and Celeron(R) Ds using the "Prescott" core have EM64T support. See the http://processorfinder.intel.com[Intel Processor Spec Finder] for the definitive answer about EM64T support in Intel processors.

Intel(R) EM64T is an extended version of IA-32 (x86) and different from Intel(R) IA-64 (Itanium) architecture, which FreeBSD/ia64 supports. Some Intel(R)'s old documentation refers to Intel(R) EM64T as "64-bit extension technology" or "IA-32e".

Both Uniprocessor (UP) and Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP) configurations are supported.

In many respects, FreeBSD/amd64 is similar to FreeBSD/i386, in terms of drivers supported. Generally, drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit platforms should work.

[[proc-i386]]
== 2.2. i386

FreeBSD/i386 runs on a wide variety of "IBM PC compatible" machines. Due to the wide range of hardware available for this architecture, it is impossible to exhaustively list all combinations of equipment supported by FreeBSD. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are presented here.

Almost all i386(TM)-compatible processors with a floating point unit are supported. All Intel(R) processors beginning with the 80486 are supported, including the 80486, Pentium(R), Pentium(R) Pro, Pentium(R) II, Pentium(R) III, Pentium(R) 4, and variants thereof, such as the Xeon(TM) and Celeron(R) processors. All i386(TM)-compatible AMD processors are also supported, including the Am486(R), Am5x86(R), K5, AMD-K6(R) (and variants), AMD Athlon(TM) (including Athlon-MP, Athlon-XP, Athlon-4, and Athlon Thunderbird), and AMD Duron(TM) processors. The AMD Élan SC520 embedded processor is supported. The Transmeta Crusoe is recognized and supported, as are i386(TM)-compatible processors from Cyrix and NexGen.

There is a wide variety of motherboards available for this architecture. Motherboards using the ISA, VLB, EISA, AGP, and PCI expansion buses are well-supported. There is some limited support for the MCA ("MicroChannel") expansion bus used in the IBM PS/2 line of PCs.

Symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems are generally supported by FreeBSD, although in some cases, BIOS or motherboard bugs may generate some problems. Perusal of the archives of the http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-smp[FreeBSD symmetric multiprocessing mailing list] may yield some clues.

FreeBSD will take advantage of SMT (Symmetric MultiThreading, also known as HyperThreading on Intel(R) CPUs) on the supported CPUs. The `GENERIC` kernel which is installed by default will automatically detect the additional logical processors. The default FreeBSD scheduler recognizes processor topology on the system and selects logical and physical processors to obtain optimal performance. The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=smp&sektion=4[smp(4)] manual page has more details.

FreeBSD will take advantage of Physical Address Extensions (PAE) support on CPUs that support this feature. A kernel with the `PAE` feature enabled will detect memory above 4 gigabytes and allow it to be used by the system. This feature places constraints on the device drivers and other features of FreeBSD which may be used; consult the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pae&sektion=4[pae(4)] manual page for more details.

FreeBSD will generally run on i386-based laptops, albeit with varying levels of support for certain hardware features such as sound, graphics, power management, and PCCARD expansion slots. These features tend to vary in idiosyncratic ways between machines, and frequently require special-case support in FreeBSD to work around hardware bugs or other oddities. When in doubt, a search of the archives of the http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-mobile[FreeBSD laptop computer mailing list] may be useful.

Most modern laptops (as well as many desktops) use the Advanced Configuration and Power Management (ACPI) standard. FreeBSD supports ACPI via the ACPI Component Architecture reference implementation from Intel(R), as described in the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=acpi&sektion=4[acpi(4)] manual page. The use of ACPI causes instabilities on some machines and it may be necessary to disable the ACPI driver, which is normally loaded via a kernel module. This may be accomplished by adding the following line to `/boot/device.hints`:

[.programlisting]
----
hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
----

Users debugging ACPI-related problems may find it useful to disable portions of the ACPI functionality. The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=acpi&sektion=4[acpi(4)] manual page has more information on how to do this via loader tunables.

ACPI depends on a Differentiated System Descriptor Table (DSDT) provided by each machine's BIOS. Some machines have bad or incomplete DSDTs, which prevents ACPI from functioning correctly. Replacement DSDTs for some machines can be found at the http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php[DSDT] section of the http://acpi.sourceforge.net/[ACPI4Linux] project Web site. FreeBSD can use these DSDTs to override the DSDT provided by the BIOS; see the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=acpi&sektion=4[acpi(4)] manual page for more information.

[[proc-ia64]]
== 2.3. ia64

Currently supported processors are the http://people.freebsd.org/~marcel/refs/ia64/itanium/24532003.pdf[Itanium(R)] and the http://people.freebsd.org/~marcel/refs/ia64/itanium2/25111003.pdf[Itanium(R) 2].

Supported chipsets include:

* HP zx1
* Intel(R) 460GX
* Intel(R) E8870

Both Uniprocessor (UP) and Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP) configurations are supported.

Most devices that can be found in or are compatible with ia64 machines are fully supported. The notable exception is the VGA console. The FreeBSD support for VGA consoles is at this time too much based on PC hardware and not all ia64 machines have chipsets that provide sufficient PC legacy support. As such http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=syscons&sektion=4[syscons(4)] cannot be enabled and the use of a serial console is required.

[[proc-pc98]]
== 2.4. pc98

NEC PC-9801/9821 series with almost all i386(TM)-compatible processors, including 80486, Pentium(R), Pentium(R) Pro, Pentium(R) II, and variants. All i386(TM)-compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix, IBM, and IDT are also supported.

NEC FC-9801/9821 series, and NEC SV-98 series (both of them are compatible with PC-9801/9821 series) should be supported.

EPSON PC-386/486/586 series, which are compatible with NEC PC-9801 series are supported.

High-resolution mode is not supported. NEC PC-98XA/XL/RL/XL^2, and NEC PC-H98 series are supported in normal (PC-9801 compatible) mode only.

Although there are some multi-processor systems (such as Rs20/B20), SMP-related features of FreeBSD are not supported yet.

PC-9801/9821 standard bus (called C-Bus), PC-9801NOTE expansion bus (110pin), and PCI bus are supported. New Extend Standard Architecture (NESA) bus (used in PC-H98, SV-H98, and FC-H98 series) is not supported.

[[proc-powerpc]]
== 2.5. powerpc

All Apple PowerPC machines with built-in USB are supported, as well a limited selection of non-Apple machines, including KVM on POWER7

SMP is supported on all systems with more than 1 processor.

[[proc-sparc64]]
== 2.6. sparc64

This section describes the systems currently known to be supported by FreeBSD on the Fujitsu SPARC64(R) and Sun UltraSPARC(R) platforms.

SMP is supported on all systems with more than 1 processor.

When using the `GENERIC` kernel, FreeBSD/sparc64 systems not equipped with a framebuffer supported by the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=creator&sektion=4[creator(4)] (Sun Creator, Sun Creator3D and Sun Elite3D) or http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=machfb&sektion=4[machfb(4)] (Sun PGX and Sun PGX64 as well as the ATI Mach64 chips found onboard in for example Sun Blade(TM) 100, Sun Blade(TM) 150, Sun Ultra(TM) 5 and Sun Ultra(TM) 10) driver must use the serial console.

[[support]]
== 3. Supported Devices

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by FreeBSD. Other configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested yet. Feedback, updates, and corrections to this list are encouraged.

Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class of devices is listed. If the driver in question has a manual page in the FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here. Information on specific models of supported devices, controllers, etc. can be found in the manual pages.

[.note]
*Note*: +
The device lists in this document are being generated automatically from FreeBSD manual pages. This means that some devices, which are supported by multiple drivers, may appear multiple times.

* US Robotics 5411

The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bwi&sektion=4[bwi(4)] driver uses the older v3 version of Broadcom's firmware. While this older firmware does support most BCM43xx parts, the bwn(4) driver works better for the newer chips it supports. You must use the http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bwi&sektion=4[bwi(4)] driver if you are using older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and BCM4306 rev 2). The v4 version of the firmware that bwn(4) uses does not support these chips.

The http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bwn&sektion=4[bwn(4)] driver supports Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices, including:

* Apple Airport Extreme
* ASUS WL-138g

* Dell Truemobile 1400
* HP Compaq 6715b
* HP nx6125
* Linksys WPC54G Ver 3
* Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2
* US Robotics 5411

Users of older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and BCM4306 rev 2) must use bwi(4) because the v4 version of the firmware does not support these chips. The newer firmware is too big to fit into these old chips.

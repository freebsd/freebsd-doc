= FreeBSD 9.3 Release TODO Items

== Introduction

Please *do not* edit this file unless you are on the Release Engineering Team, or a member of the Release Engineering Team gave you explicit permission to do so.

This is the release cycle _TODO_ page, outlining items that are in-progress, issues that must be fixed (release blockers), issues that need to be fixed but are not blockers, and issues that should be fixed as an Errata Notice after the release.

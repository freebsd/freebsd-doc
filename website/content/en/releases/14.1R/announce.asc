       operations on amd64 for improved performance.

     * Improvements to the sound subsystem, including device hotplug.

     * Initial native cloud-init (configuration drive) support compatible
       with OpenStack and many hosters.

     * OpenZFS has been upgraded to version 2.2.4.

     * Clang/LLVM have been upgraded to version 18.1.5.

     * OpenSSH has been upgraded to version 9.7p1.

   For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the
   online release notes and errata list, available at:

     * https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/14.1R/relnotes/

Availability

   FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, powerpc,
   powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv7, aarch64, and riscv64
   architectures.

   FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images or over
   the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory
   stick. The required files can be downloaded as described in the section
   below.

   SHA512 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and SD card
   images are included at the bottom of this message.

   PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available at:

     * https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/14.1R/signatures/

   A PGP-signed version of this announcement is available at:

     * https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/14.1R/announce.asc

   The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:

   dvd1

           This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD
           operating system, the documentation, debugging distribution sets,
           and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a
           graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting
           into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if
           you can burn and use DVD-sized media.

           Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
           drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
           machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
           booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.

           As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB
           drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
           should work:

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

   disc1

           This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports
           booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
           packages.

           Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
           drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
           machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
           booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
           packages.

           As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB
           drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
           should work:

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

   bootonly

           This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does
           not contain the installation distribution sets for installing
           FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network
           based install (e.g., from an HTTP or FTP server) after booting
           from the CD.

           Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
           drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
           machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
           booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
           packages.

           As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB
           drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
           should work:

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

   memstick

           This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
           to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives.
           It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There
           are no pre-built packages.

           As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB
           drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
           should work:

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

   mini-memstick

           This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
           to boot a machine, but does not contain the installation
           distribution sets on the medium itself, similar to the bootonly
           image. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue
           mode. There are no pre-built packages.

           As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image, assuming
           the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like
           this should work:

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

   FreeBSD/arm SD card images

           These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the supported
           arm system. The SD card image contains the full FreeBSD
           installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as small as 5
           GB.

           For convenience for those without console access to the system, a
           freebsd user with a password of freebsd is available by default
           for ssh(1) access. Additionally, the root user password is set to
           root, which it is strongly recommended to change the password for
           both users after gaining access to the system.

           To write the FreeBSD/arm image to an SD card, use the dd(1)
           utility, replacing KERNEL with the appropriate kernel
           configuration name for the system.

 # dd if=FreeBSD-14.1-RELEASE-arm64-aarch64-RPI.img \
     of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync

           Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

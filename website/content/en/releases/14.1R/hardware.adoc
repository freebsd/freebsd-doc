[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the hardware compatibility notes for FreeBSD 14.1.
It lists the hardware platforms supported by FreeBSD, as well as the various types of hardware devices (storage controllers, network interfaces, and so on), along with known working instances of these devices.

[[proc]]
== Supported Processors and System Boards

This section provides some architecture-specific information about the specific processors and systems that are supported by each architecture.

[[proc-amd64]]
=== 64-bit x86 (amd64) Architecture Support

FreeBSD supports the AMD64 ("Hammer") and Intel(R) EM64T architectures.
AMD64 (also known as x86-64) is a fully-supported Tier 1 architecture.
AMD64 supports all modern x86 processors.
This release incorporates optimizations and enhancements to leverage the full capabilities of FreeBSD/amd64-based systems, delivering improved performance across a wide range of workloads.

[[proc-i386]]
=== i386 Architecture Support

While FreeBSD continues to evolve and optimize for modern architectures, we are committed to maintaining support for the venerable i386 (x86) architecture in this release.
Although i386 hardware is becoming less common, FreeBSD remains a reliable and versatile choice for those who still rely on it, whether for legacy systems or specific use cases.

[[proc-arm]]
=== ARM Architecture Support

FreeBSD features robust ARM architecture support, enhancing compatibility and performance across a diverse array of ARM-based devices.

[[proc-powerpc]]
=== PowerPC Architecture Support

Many PowerPC platforms are supported, including but not limited to:

* Apple PowerMac G4 and later.
* IBM POWER4 and later using pseries VM platform.
* IBM POWER8 and later bare metal powernv
** Most development done using Raptor TALOS-II
* Embedded NXP QorIQ and PowerQUICC III (MPC85XX, Pxxx)
** Tested on AmigaOne X5000 and AmigaOne A1222

// The "Supported Devices" section of the release notes.
// Generally processor-independent, with conditional text
// inclusion handling any architecture-dependent text.

// Within each subsection describing a class of hardware
// (i.e. Ethernet interfaces), list broad groups of devices
// alphabetically as paragraphs sorted alphabetically (frequently
// these groups will be arranged by manufacturer, i.e. 3Com
// Ethernet interfaces).

// Where applicable, a "Miscellaneous" section may follow all
// other named sections.

// These guidelines are not hard-and-fast rules, and exceptions
// will occur.  Following these guidelines (vague as they may be)
// is highly recommended to try to keep the formatting of
// this section consistent.

// We give manpage references using the &man entities where
// possible.  If a driver has no manpage (and consequently no
// &man entity, we simply give the name of the driver).
// Please avoid doing &man entity conversions unless you
// know for sure that an entity and manpage exist; sweeps through
// this file to fix "missed" conversions are likely to break the
// build.

[[support]]
== Supported Devices

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by FreeBSD.
Other configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested yet.
Feedback, updates, and corrections to this list are encouraged.

Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class of devices is listed.
If the driver in question has a manual page in the FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here.
Information on specific models of supported devices, controllers, etc. can be found in the manual pages.

[NOTE]
====
The device lists in this document are being generated automatically from FreeBSD manual pages.
This means that some devices, which are supported by multiple drivers, may appear multiple times.

The
**ahci**
driver supports AHCI compatible controllers having PCI class 1 (mass storage),
subclass 6 (SATA) and programming interface 1 (AHCI).

Also, in cooperation with atamarvell and atajmicron drivers of ata(4),
it supports AHCI part of legacy-PATA + AHCI-SATA combined controllers,
such as JMicron JMB36x and Marvell 88SE61xx.

The
**ahci**
driver also supports AHCI devices that act as PCI bridges for
nvme(4)
using Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST).
To use the
nvme(4)
device, either one must set the SATA mode in the BIOS to AHCI (from RST),
or one must accept the performance with RST enabled due to interrupt sharing.
FreeBSD
will automatically detect AHCI devices with this extension that are in RST
mode.
When that happens,
**ahci**
will attach
nvme(4)
children to the
**ahci**
device.



The
**ahd**
driver supports the following:

*	Adaptec
	`AIC7901`
	host adapter chip
*	Adaptec
	`AIC7901A`
	host adapter chip
*	Adaptec
	`AIC7902`
	host adapter chip
*	Adaptec
	`29320`
	host adapter
*	Adaptec
	`39320`
	host adapter
*	Many motherboards with on-board
	`SCSI`
	support

Some of above chips can be configured for AHCI mode.
In such case they are supported by
ahci(4)
driver instead.

Unknown ATA chipsets are supported in PIO modes, and if the standard
busmaster DMA registers are present and contain valid setup, DMA is
also enabled, although the max mode is limited to UDMA33, as it is
not known what the chipset can do and how to program it.

bwn(4)
driver works better for the newer chips it supports.
You must use the
**bwi**
driver if you are using older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and
BCM4306 rev 2).
The v4 version of the firmware that

uses does not support these chips.



The
**bwn**
driver supports Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices, including:

	*Card*                   *Chip*     *Bus*       *Standard*  
	Apple Airport Extreme    BCM4318    PCI         b/g  
	ASUS WL-138g             BCM4318    PCI         b/g  
	Buffalo WLI-CB-G54S      BCM4318    CardBus     b/g  
	Dell Wireless 1390       BCM4311    Mini PCI    b/g  
	Dell Wireless 1470       BCM4318    Mini PCI    b/g  
	Dell Truemobile 1400     BCM4309    Mini PCI    b/g  
	HP Compaq 6715b          BCM4312    PCI         b/g  
	HP nx6125                BCM4319    PCI         b/g  
	Linksys WPC54G Ver 3     BCM4318    CardBus     b/g  
	Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2    BCM4318    CardBus     b/g  
	US Robotics 5411         BCM4318    CardBus     b/g

Users of older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and BCM4306 rev 2)
must use
bwi(4)
because the v4 version of the firmware does not support these chips.
The newer firmware is too big to fit into these old chips.

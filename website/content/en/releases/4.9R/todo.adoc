<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  4.9.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>

<p>As many of these open issues involve merging bus_dma driver changes
  from -CURRENT, the <a href="../../../projects/busdma/index.html" shape="rect">busdma</a> project page is
  also useful.</p>

      KVA space in -CURRENT with large memory machines.</td>

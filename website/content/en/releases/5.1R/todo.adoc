  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fresh ACPI-CA import</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The 20030228 vendor sources have been imported.  Further testing is
    appreciated.</td>

  <tr>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PAE support for i386</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PAE support allows the use of up to 64GB of RAM on Pentium Pro and above
    systems.  Virtual addresses are still constrained to 32-bits.</td>

  <tr>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">if_wi problems on Lucent hardware</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The recently upgraded if_wi driver is more tuned to Prism hardware
    than to Lucent hardware, resulting in system lockups and poor performance
    when using Lucent hardware.  These problems are believed to be fixed
    but more testing is welcome.</td>

  <tr>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">UFS2 as installation, newfs default</td>

  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Robert Watson</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">For 5.1-RELEASE, the default file system type for newly created
    file systems is UFS2 rather than UFS1.  newfs(8) and sysinstall(8)
    have been updated to use this new default.  Testing to make sure all
    goes well after the change (committed on April 20, 2003) is
    vital.</td>

  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NSSwitch support</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Jacques Vidrine</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Support for pluggable directory services using NSS, including

    and support for new services (LDAP, Active Directory, etc).
    This change has been committed, and requires broader testing.</td>

  <tr>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spurious alpha panics</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">--</td>
  <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kris Kennaway reports that he has seen several unique panics on the
    alpha machines, but since gdb -k doesn't work on alpha I haven't
    been able to get more than a DDB traceback.  No-one has looked
    into them.</td>

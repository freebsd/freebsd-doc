<p>This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 4.10-RELEASE, containing significant
information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as
well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
installing this version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This errata document for FreeBSD 4.10-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of
FreeBSD 4.11-RELEASE.</p>

<p>This errata document contains ``late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD 4.10-RELEASE.
Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about
any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.</p>

<p>Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for
example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are
kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the ``current errata'' for this
release. These other copies of the errata are located at <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"
target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>, plus any sites which keep up-to-date
mirrors of this location.</p>

<p>Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 4-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this
document (as of the time of the snapshot).</p>

<p>(20 May 2004) A security problem was discovered in <b class="APPLICATION">CVS</b> but
the release notes did not state that since it was very late in the release cycle. FreeBSD
4.10-RELEASE includes a fix for it and is not vulnerable. For the details, see the
security advisory <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:10.cvs.asc"
target="_top">FreeBSD-SA-04:10</a>.</p>

<p>(23 May 2004) As a side effect of closing a security problem related to <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=msync&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">msync</span>(2)</span></a>, the
<var class="LITERAL">MS_INVALIDATE</var> flag no longer guarantees that all pages in the
range are invalidated. This can cause problems when pages are backed by a remote file
(e.g. via NFS) where other machines can write to the permanent storage since the local
pages not being invalidated might then contain stale data. The security problem being
addressed is a strictly local exploit, and only allows a local user to block the writing
of data to a file under certain circumstances. Users who require the old semantics of
<var class="LITERAL">MS_INVALIDATE</var> and are not concerned with the security issue
being fixed can set the <var class="LITERAL">vm.old_msync</var> sysctl to <var
class="LITERAL">1</var> which will revert to the old (insecure) behavior.</p>

<p>(25 May 2004) The <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=twe&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">twe</span>(4)</span></a> driver
was recently updated by the vendor. Problems have been reported in rare circumstances
under conditions that are hard to reproduce. Work is ongoing to isolate these problems
and determine their source.</p>

<p>(27 May 2004) The <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bfe&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">bfe</span>(4)</span></a> driver
for Broadcom BCM4401 based Fast Ethernet adapters has been added but the release notes
did not mention that.</p>

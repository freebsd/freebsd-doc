**Subject:**FreeBSD 2.2.8 is now released!

It is, as always, my great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD 2.2.8, our latest and final release along the 2.2-stable branch. Those folks who are still running 2.1.x and wish to upgrade to 2.2 technology are definitely encouraged to do so now as the 2.2-stable branch has gone into maintainence mode. A number of problems with 2.2.7 have been fixed and the link:notes.html[release notes] should be consulted for more information.

FreeBSD 2.2.8-RELEASE is available on ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD[ftp.FreeBSD.org] and various link:{handbook}#mirrors[FTP mirror sites] throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.cdrom.com/[Walnut Creek CDROM], from where it will be shipping shortly as a 4 CD set containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to programmers and general users alike.

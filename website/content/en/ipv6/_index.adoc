== Introduction

FreeBSD has shipped tightly integrated IPv6 support for over a decade, with the FreeBSD 4.0 in 2000 the first release to include "out-of-the-box" IPv6 support. These web pages document on-going IPv6 development in the FreeBSD community, including participation in IPv6 World Day 2011.

== IPv6 in FreeBSD

FreeBSD is a widely used, open source operating system whose network stack has been the foundation for decades of research, as well as a reference implementation of IPv6 (developed by the http://www.kame.net/[KAME] project). FreeBSD first shipped IPv6 support in March 2000 as part of FreeBSD link:../releases/[4.0-Release].

== IPv6 and the FreeBSD Project

The FreeBSD Project has been an early adopter and active participant in the IPv6 community. With the help of the community, we have been serving releases from IPv6-enabled servers since May 2003 and FreeBSD's website, mailing lists, and developer infrastructure have been IPv6 enabled since 2007.

FreeBSD is used by critical Internet infrastructure such as root name servers, routers, firewalls and some of the world's busiest and most reliable web sites as well as embedded into many products all in the need for the best IPv6 support. To read more about some companies using the FreeBSD operating system in their products, see the https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/testimonials.shtml[FreeBSD Foundation Testimonials] page.

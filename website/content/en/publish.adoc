|link:../gifs/wc-44lite2b.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-44lite2.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=142]] |This is the original 4.4 BSD Lite2 release from UC Berkeley, the core technology behind much of FreeBSD.
|link:../gifs/las512b.jpg[image:../gifs/las512.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=171]] |The first of Laser5's "BSD" series. Contains FreeBSD-2.0.5R, NetBSD-1.0, XFree86-3.1.1 and FreeBSD(98) kernel.
|link:../gifs/las523b.jpg[image:../gifs/las523.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=132]] |The second of Laser5's "BSD" series. From this version, the CDs come in a standard jewel box. Contains FreeBSD-2.1R, NetBSD-1.1, XFree86-3.1.2 and 3.1.2A, and FreeBSD(98) kernel (2.0.5).
|link:../gifs/las5b.jpg[image:../gifs/las5.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=128]] |This is the Laser5 Japanese edition of the FreeBSD CDROM. It is a 4 CD set.
|link:../gifs/phtb.jpg[image:../gifs/pht.jpg[CD cover,width=151,height=150]] |This is the only FreeBSD CD Pacific Hitech produced before merging their product line with that of Walnut Creek CDROM. PHT now also produces the FreeBSD/J (Japanese) CD product.
|[#221cd]####link:../gifs/coverb.jpg[image:../gifs/cover.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=150]] |This is the cover disc from the Korean link:#magazines[magazine]. Note the creative cover art! The CD contains the FreeBSD 2.2.1 release with some local additions.
|link:../gifs/wc-10b.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-10.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=143]] |This is it - the very first FreeBSD CD published!

|link:../gifs/wc-blunb.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-blun.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=148]] |This unusual CD is something of a collector's item now given that almost all existing examples were systematically tracked down and destroyed. An artwork mishap has this CD dated for the wrong year, and on the spine "January" is also misspelled as "Jaunary", just to increase the embarrassment factor. Ah, the perils of turning in one's artwork just hours before leaving for a trade show.

|link:../gifs/wc-216jpb.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-216jp.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=150]] |The Japanese version of 2.1.6. This was the first and last Japanese localized version published by WC, responsibility for that product then transitioning to a team led by Tatsumi Hosokawa and sponsored by Pacific Hitech and Laser5.
|link:../gifs/wc-217b.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-217.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=149]] |The FreeBSD 2.1.7 release CD. Also the last CD released on the 2.1.x branch. Done primarily as a security fixup for 2.1.6
|link:../gifs/wc-22snapb.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-22snap.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=148]] |An early release SNAPshot of 2.2 (done before 2.2.1 was released).
|link:../gifs/wc-221b.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-221.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=148]] |The FreeBSD 2.2.1 release CD. This was the first CD on the 2.2 branch.

|link:../gifs/wc-30snab.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-30sna.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=148]] |The FreeBSD 3.0 snapshot CD.
|link:../gifs/wc-docsb.jpg[image:../gifs/wc-docs.jpg[CD cover,width=150,height=148]] |The FreeBSD mailing list and newsgroup archives, turned into HTML and semi-indexed by thread. This product ran for 2 releases and then stopped with a thud once it became obvious that there was simply too much data to deal with on one CD. Perhaps when DVD becomes more popular...

[[docs]]
== Documentation

link:{freebsd-releng}[FreeBSD Release Engineering] describes: 

- the Primary Release Engineering Team's methods
- tools to customize releases.

[[team]]
== Teams

The Primary Release Engineering Team is responsible for approving link:{handbook}glossary/#mfc-glossary[MFC] requests during code freezes, setting release schedules, and all of the other responsibilities laid out in its link:../releng/charter/[charter].

*Primary RE Team (re@FreeBSD.org)* : {re-members} form the primary release engineering decision-making group.

The third party packages in the Ports Collection are managed by the pkgmgr@ team. Among many other responsibilities, the package managers keep the ports cluster running smoothly to produce binary packages.

*Package Builders (pkgmgr@FreeBSD.org)* : {pkgmgr-members}

[[old]]
== Old Releases

The archive at http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/old-releases/[] includes many ISO images.

The FreeBSD Project does not maintain a complete archive. Older releases that are no longer online may be available from CD-ROM vendors.

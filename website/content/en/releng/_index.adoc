[[freeze]]
== Code-Freeze Status

This table lists the code freeze status for major branches of the `src/` repository of the FreeBSD Git repositories. Commits to any branch listed as "frozen" must first be reviewed and approved by the relevant contact party. The status of other repositories such as `ports/` and `doc/` is also provided below.

[[docs]]
== Release Engineering Documentation

* link:{freebsd-releng}[FreeBSD Release Engineering] +
This document details the approach used by the FreeBSD release engineering team to make production-quality releases of the FreeBSD Operating System. It describes the tools available for those interested in producing customized FreeBSD releases for corporate rollouts or commercial productization.

[[team]]
== Release Engineering Team

The primary release engineering team is responsible for approving link:{handbook}glossary/#mfc-glossary[MFC] requests during code freezes, setting release schedules, and all of the other responsibilities laid out in our link:../releng/charter/[charter].

*Primary RE Team (re@FreeBSD.org)* : {re-members} form the primary release engineering decision-making group.

The third party packages in the Ports Collection are managed by the pkgmgr@ team. Among many other responsibilities, the package managers keep the ports cluster running smoothly to produce binary packages.

*Package Builders (pkgmgr@FreeBSD.org)* : {pkgmgr-members}

[[old]]
== Old Releases

The FreeBSD Project does not maintain a complete archive of old release ISO images, but many of them are available at ftp://ftp-archive.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/old-releases/.

Older releases that are no longer present on any FTP mirror might still be available from CD-ROM vendors.

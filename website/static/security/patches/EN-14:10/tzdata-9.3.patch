+# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
+# [undated and unknown publication location]
+# It says several things:
+#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
+#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
+#     the official calendar book of 1914.
+#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
+#     French docks in the 1890s, controled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
+#     Obervatory and set to local mean time.
+#   * "From the end of the 19th century" it changed to UT+8.
+#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
+#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
+#     became used by railways as well.
+#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
+#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
+#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
+#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
+#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
+#     Japanese-occupied territory.
+#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
+#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
+#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear
+#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.

+# An AP article "Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed" in the

+#
+# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using

+#
+# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan

+# modern times", New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines

+# The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best

 # Australia
 
+# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
+# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
+# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
+# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
+# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
+# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
+# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
+# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
+# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
+# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."

 # The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least

-# the phrase `summer time' and does not use the phrase `daylight

 # Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian

-# From Chuck Soper (2006-06-01):
-# I recently found this Australian government web page on time zones:
-# <http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-13time>
-# And this government web page lists time zone names and abbreviations:
-# <http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml>
-
-# From Paul Eggert (2001-04-05), summarizing a long discussion about "EST"
-# versus "AEST" etc.:
+# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 #
-# I see the following points of dispute:
+# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
+# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
+# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
+# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
+# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
+# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
+# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
+# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
+# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
+# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
+# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
+# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
 #
-# * How important are unique time zone abbreviations?
+#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
+#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
+#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
+#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
+#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
+#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
+#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
 #
-#   Here I tend to agree with the point (most recently made by Chris
-#   Newman) that unique abbreviations should not be essential for proper
-#   operation of software.  We have other instances of ambiguity
-#   (e.g. "IST" denoting both "Israel Standard Time" and "Indian
-#   Standard Time"), and they are not likely to go away any time soon.
-#   In the old days, some software mistakenly relied on unique
-#   abbreviations, but this is becoming less true with time, and I don't
-#   think it's that important to cater to such software these days.
+#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
 #
-#   On the other hand, there is another motivation for unambiguous
-#   abbreviations: it cuts down on human confusion.  This is
-#   particularly true for Australia, where "EST" can mean one thing for
-#   time T and a different thing for time T plus 1 second.
+# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
+# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
+# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
+# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
 #
-# * Does the relevant legislation indicate which abbreviations should be used?
+#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
+#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
 #
-#   Here I tend to think that things are a mess, just as they are in
-#   many other countries.  We Americans are currently disagreeing about
-#   which abbreviation to use for the newly legislated Chamorro Standard
-#   Time, for example.
+# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
+# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
+# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
+# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
+# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
+# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
+# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
 #
-#   Personally, I would prefer to use common practice; I would like to
-#   refer to legislation only for examples of common practice, or as a
-#   tiebreaker.
+# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
+# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
+# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
+# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
+# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
+# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
+# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
+# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
+# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
+# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
+# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
+# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
+# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
+# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
 #
-# * Do Australians more often use "Eastern Daylight Time" or "Eastern
-#   Summer Time"?  Do they typically prefix the time zone names with
-#   the word "Australian"?
+# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:
 #
-#   My own impression is that both "Daylight Time" and "Summer Time" are
-#   common and are widely understood, but that "Summer Time" is more
-#   popular; and that the leading "A" is also common but is omitted more
-#   often than not.  I just used AltaVista advanced search and got the
-#   following count of page hits:
+#   The Australian Government (2014-03-26)
+#   http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/time
+#   (This document was produced by the Department of Finance.)
+#   AEST ACST AWST AEDT ACDT

-#       971 "Australian Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
-#       613 "Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
-#       127 "Australian Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
+#   Bureau of Meteorology (2012-11-08)
+#   http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml
+#   EST CST WST EDT CDT
 #
-#   Here "Summer" seems quite a bit more popular than "Daylight",
-#   particularly when we know the time zone is Australian and not US,
-#   say.  The "Australian" prefix seems to be popular for Eastern Summer
-#   Time, but unpopular for Eastern Daylight Time.
+#   Civil Aviation Safety Authority (undated)
+#   http://services.casa.gov.au/outnback/inc/pages/episode3/episode-3_time_zones.shtml
+#   EST CST WST (no abbreviations given for DST)
 #
-#   For abbreviations, tools like AltaVista are less useful because of
-#   ambiguity.  Many hits are not really time zones, unfortunately, and
-#   many hits denote US time zones and not Australian ones.  But here
-#   are the hit counts anyway:

-#          29 "ACDT" and domain:au
+#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
+#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
+#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
+#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
+#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
+#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
 #
-#       7,539 "WST" and domain:au
-#          68 "AWST" and domain:au
-#
-#   This data suggest that Australians tend to omit the "A" prefix in
-#   practice.  The situation for "ST" versus "DT" is less clear, given
-#   the ambiguities involved.
-#
-# * How do Australians feel about the abbreviations in the tz database?
-#
-#   If you just count Australians on this list, I count 2 in favor and 3
-#   against.  One of the "against" votes (David Keegel) counseled delay,
-#   saying that both AEST/AEDT and EST/EST are widely used and
-#   understood in Australia.
+# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
+# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
+# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
+# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
+# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
+# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
+# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
+# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
+# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

+# Srednekolymsk and Zyryanka are the most populous places amongst these

+# tz zone descriptions
+#
+# This file is in the public domain.
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
+# This file contains a table where each row stands for a zone where
+# civil time stamps have agreed since 1970.  Columns are separated by
+# a single tab.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  All text uses
+# UTF-8 encoding.  The columns of the table are as follows:
+#
+# 1.  The countries that overlap the zone, as a comma-separated list
+#     of ISO 3166 2-character country codes.
+#     See the file '/usr/share/misc/iso3166'.
+# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the zone's principal location
+#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,
+#     either +-DDMM+-DDDMM or +-DDMMSS+-DDDMMSS,
+#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).
+# 3.  Zone name used in value of TZ environment variable.
+#     Please see the 'Theory' file for how zone names are chosen.
+#     If multiple zones overlap a country, each has a row in the
+#     table, with each column 1 containing the country code.
+# 4.  Comments; present if and only if a country has multiple zones.
+#
+# If a zone covers multiple countries, the most-populous city is used,
+# and that country is listed first in column 1; any other countries
+# are listed alphabetically by country code.  The table is sorted
+# first by country code, then (if possible) by an order within the
+# country that (1) makes some geographical sense, and (2) puts the
+# most populous zones first, where that does not contradict (1).
+#
+# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time
+# zone data appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended
+# to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.

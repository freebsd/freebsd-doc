Topic:          OpenSSL NULL pointer deference vulnerability

Category:       contrib
Module:         openssl
Announced:      2014-05-13
Affects:        FreeBSD 10.x.
Corrected:      2014-05-13 23:19:16 UTC (stable/10, 10.0-STABLE)
                2014-05-13 23:22:28 UTC (releng/10.0, 10.0-RELEASE-p3)
CVE Name:       CVE-2014-0198

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

The TLS protocol supports an alert protocol which can be used to signal the
other party with certain failures in the protocol context that may require
immediate termination of the connection.

II.  Problem Description

An attacker can trigger generation of an SSL alert which could cause a null
pointer deference.

III. Impact

An attacker may be able to cause a service process that uses OpenSSL to crash,
which can be used in a denial-of-service attack.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that do not use OpenSSL to implement
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
protocols, or not using SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS and use the same process
to handle multiple SSL connections, are not vulnerable.

The FreeBSD base system service daemons and utilities do not use the
SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode.  However, many third party software uses this
mode to reduce their memory footprint and may therefore be affected by this
issue.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:10/openssl.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:10/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

Branch/path                                                      Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

releng/10.0/                                                      r265987

To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

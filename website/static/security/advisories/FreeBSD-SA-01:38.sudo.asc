Topic:          sudo contains local buffer overflow

Category:       ports
Module:         sudo
Announced:      2001-04-23
Credits:        Chris Wilson <chris@ritc.co.uk>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-03-07
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

sudo is a program that allowss a sysadmin to give limited root
privileges to users and logs root activity.

II.  Problem Description

The sudo port, versions prior to sudo-1.6.3.7, contains a local
command-line buffer overflow allowing a local user to potentially
gain increased privileges on the local system.

The sudo port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
over 5000 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  The
ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this
problem since it was discovered after the releases.  The ports
collection that shipped with FreeBSD 4.3 is not vulnerable since this
problem was corrected prior to the release.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Local users may potentially gain increased privileges on the local
system.

If you have not chosen to install the sudo port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the sudo port/package if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the sudo port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/security/sudo-1.6.3.7.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/security/sudo-1.6.3.7.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the sudo port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

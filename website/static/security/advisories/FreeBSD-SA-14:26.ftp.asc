For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The ftp(1) userland utility is an interactive FTP client.  It can also
be used non-interactively, by providing a URL on the command line.  In
this mode, it supports HTTP in addition to FTP.

II.  Problem Description

A malicious HTTP server could cause ftp(1) to execute arbitrary
commands.

III. Impact

When operating on HTTP URIs, the ftp(1) client follows HTTP redirects,
and uses the part of the path after the last '/' from the last
resource it accesses as the output filename if '-o' is not specified.

If the output file name provided by the server begins with a pipe
('|'), the output is passed to popen(3), which might be used to
execute arbitrary commands on the ftp(1) client machine.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Users are encouraged to replace ftp(1) in
non-interactive use by either fetch(1) or a third-party client such as
curl or wget.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 8]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:26/ftp-8.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:26/ftp-8.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ftp-8.patch.asc

[All other versions]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:26/ftp.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:26/ftp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ftp.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile ftp.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/ftp
# make && make install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

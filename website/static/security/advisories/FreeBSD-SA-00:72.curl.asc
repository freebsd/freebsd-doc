                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          curl client-side vulnerability

Category:       ports
Module:         curl
Announced:      2000-11-20
Credits:        Wichert Akkerman <wichert@cistron.nl>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2000-10-30
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

curl is a multi-protocol file retrieval tool.

II.  Problem Description

The curl port, versions prior to 7.4.1, allows a client-side exploit
through a buffer overflow in the error handling code.  A malicious ftp
server operator can cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user
running the curl client.

The curl port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
over 4100 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.
The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.1.1 contain
this problem since it was discovered after the releases, but it was
corrected prior to the release of FreeBSD 4.2.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious FTP server operators can execute arbitrary code on the local
system when a file is downloaded from this server.

If you have not chosen to install the curl port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the curl port/package, if you you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the curl port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/ftp/curl-7.4.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/ftp/curl-7.4.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/ftp/curl-7.4.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/ftp/curl-7.4.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/ftp/curl-7.4.1.tgz

3) download a new port skeleton for the curl port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

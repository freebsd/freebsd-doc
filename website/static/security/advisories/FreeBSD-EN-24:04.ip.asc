Topic:          Kernel panic triggered by bind(2)

Category:       core
Module:         ip
Announced:      2024-02-14
Affects:        FreeBSD 14.0
Corrected:      2024-01-09 00:30:05 UTC (stable/14, 14.0-STABLE)
                2024-02-14 06:05:43 UTC (releng/14.0, 14.0-RELEASE-p5)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The inpcb subsystem of the kernel is responsible for implementing
portions of socket-related system calls (e.g., bind(2)) on behalf of
IP-based network protocol implementations.  This layer provides lookup
tables which can be used within the kernel to translate between sockets
and the internet addresses to which they are bound or connected.

II.  Problem Description

The inpcb layer maintains several hash tables which are synchronized by
a combination of mutexes and the use of lock-free data structures.  The
implementation of the latter was flawed such that a locked lookup could
return a socket that was in the process of being removed from the table.

III. Impact

The race condition can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel,
resulting in a kernel panic.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r now

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:04/ip.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:04/ip.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ip.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/14/                              2bfe735277b8    stable/14-n266255
releng/14.0/                            9db5ae3ec45f  releng/14.0-n265405
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

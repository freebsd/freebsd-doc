                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Root certificate bundle update

Category:       core
Module:         caroot
Announced:      2021-02-24
Affects:        FreeBSD 12.2
Corrected:      2020-12-15 21:50:05 UTC (stable/12, 12.2-STABLE)
                2021-02-24 01:43:56 UTC (releng/12.2, 12.2-RELEASE-p4)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The root certificate bundle is the trust store that is used by OpenSSL
programs and libraries to aide in determining whether it should trust
a given SSL certificate.

II.  Problem Description

Several certificates were removed from the bundle after the latest release
of FreeBSD 12.2.

III. Impact

Certificates are often removed from the root bundle due to a failure to
meet the standards established by Mozilla for being considered a trusted
Certificate Authority.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Software that uses an internal trust store
is not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:07/caroot.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:07/caroot.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all applications that may be using OpenSSL, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

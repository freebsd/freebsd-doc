following sections, please visit

I.   Background

IPsec is a set of protocols, including ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
and AH (Authentication Header), that provide security services for IP
datagrams.  ESP protects IP payloads from wire-tapping by encrypting them
using secret key cryptography algorithms.  AH guarantees the integrity of IP
packets and protects them from intermediate alteration or impersonation by
attaching a cryptographic checksum computed using one-way hash functions.

II.  Problem Description

IPsec provides an anti-replay service which when enabled prevents an attacker
from successfully executing a replay attack.  This is done through the
verification of sequence numbers.  A programming error in the fast_ipsec(4)
implementation results in the sequence number associated with a Security
Association not being updated, allowing packets to unconditionally pass
sequence number verification checks.

III. Impact

An attacker able to to intercept IPSec packets can replay them.  If higher
level protocols which do not provide any protection against packet replays
(e.g., UDP) are used, this may have a variety of effects.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG_6_0, RELENG_5_4, RELENG_5_3, RELENG_4_11, or
RELENG_4_10 security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.10,
4.11, 5.3, 5.4, and 6.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06:11/ipsec.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06:11/ipsec.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

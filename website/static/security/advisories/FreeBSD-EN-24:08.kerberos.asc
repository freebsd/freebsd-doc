Topic:          Kerberos segfaults when using weak crypto

Category:       contrib
Module:         heimdal
Announced:      2024-03-28
Affects:        FreeBSD 14.0
Corrected:      2024-01-22 15:49:24 UTC (stable/14, 14.0-STABLE)
                2024-03-28 05:06:25 UTC (releng/14.0, 14.0-RELEASE-p6)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes Heimdal, an implementation of ASN.1/DER, PKIX, and Kerberos.
It uses OpenSSL to provide a number of cryptographic routines.

II.  Problem Description

Weak crypto is provided by the openssl "legacy" provider which is not loaded
by default.

III. Impact

Attempting to use weak crypto routines when the legacy provider is not loaded
results in the application crashing.

IV.  Workaround

Edit /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf to load the legacy provider unconditionally.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:08/kerberos.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:08/kerberos.patch.asc
# gpg --verify kerberos.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/14/                              c7db2e15e404    stable/14-n266467
releng/14.0/                            c48fe39ad139  releng/14.0-n265415
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

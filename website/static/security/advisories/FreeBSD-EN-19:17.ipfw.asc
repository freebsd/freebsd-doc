Topic:          ipfw(8) jail keyword broken prior to jail startup

Category:       core
Module:         ipfw
Announced:      2019-08-20
Affects:        FreeBSD 11.3
Corrected:      2019-08-15 17:40:48 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
                2019-08-15 17:40:48 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-STABLE)
                2019-08-20 17:46:40 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p3)

Note that this issue was introduced after the FreeBSD 11.2 and 12.0 releases.
FreeBSD 11.3 is the only affected release.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The ipfw(8) utility configures rules for the ipfw(4) firewall.  The jail
keyword applies the rule for packets pertaining to the given jail, named by
the argument.

II.  Problem Description

The jail argument no longer allowed jids to be specified before a jail was
created.  Attempts to use the jail keyword in this scenario would result in
"jail <jid> not found" errors, when previously these rules would apply to
any jail with the given jid that was subsequently started.

III. Impact

The ipfw(4) firewall will reject rules that attempt to use the jail
keyword prior to jail startup, and these rules will not be applied.

IV.  Workaround

The system administrator can apply jail-based firewall rules after jail
creation.

Systems that do not use ipfw(4) are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:17/ipfw.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:17/ipfw.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ipfw.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.
Restart jails to apply firewall rules, if required.

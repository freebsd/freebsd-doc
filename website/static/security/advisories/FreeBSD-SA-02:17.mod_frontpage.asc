Topic:          mod_frontpage port contains exploitable buffer overflow

Category:       ports
Module:         mod_frontpage
Announced:      2002-03-12
Credits:        Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>
Affects:        mod_frontpage port prior to version mod_portname-1.6.1
Corrected:      2002-02-05 16:18:42 2002 UTC
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

mod_frontpage is a replacecement for Microsoft's frontpage apache
patch to support FP extensions. It is installed as a DSO module.

II.  Problem Description

Affected versions of the mod_frontpage port contains several
exploitable buffer overflows in the fpexec wrapper, which is installed
setuid root.

The mod_frontpage port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 6000 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format. The ports collection shipped with FreeBSD 4.5 contains this
security problem since it was discovered after the release.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

A local attacker may obtain superuser privileges by exploiting the
buffer overflow bugs in fpexec.

IV.  Workaround

1) Deinstall the mod_frontpage ports/packages if you have them installed.

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from the following directories:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/www/

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

NOTE: It may be several days before updated packages are available.

3) Download a new port skeleton for the mod_frontpage port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/Latest/portcheckout.tgz

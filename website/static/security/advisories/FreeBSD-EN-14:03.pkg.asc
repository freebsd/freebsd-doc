For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit

I.   Background

The pkg(7) utility is the new package management tool for FreeBSD.  The
FreeBSD project has provided official pkg(7) packages since October 2013
and signed packages since the pkg-1.2 release in November 2013.  The
signature checking requires known public keys to be installed locally.
The repository configuration must be installed as well.

The base system also includes a pkg(7) bootstrap tool that installs the
latest real pkg(7) package.  The bootstrap tool knows where to find the
official pkg(7) package but once that is installed the real pkg(7) will
not know where to find official packages, nor have the known public key
for signature checking.

The bootstrap tool was also improved in 10.0-RELEASE to check the
signature on the pkg(7) package it is installing.

II.  Problem Description

Only FreeBSD 10.0 has been released with the official repository
configuration, known public keys, and a bootstrap tool that checks the
signature of the pkg(7) package it is installing.

To allow packages to be used on a system, the configuration must be
manually setup and keys securely fetched and installed to the proper
location.

III. Impact

Releases before 10.0 require manual configuration.  Manually configuring the
pkg(7) signatures could result in insecurely installing the keys or leaving
the signature checking disabled.

The bootstrap tool is not secure on releases prior to 10.0 due to not checking
the signature and could result in having an unofficial pkg(7) installed due to
MITM attacks.

IV.  Workaround

To securely install pkg(7) on releases prior to 10.0, install it from ports
obtained from a secure portsnap checkout:

# portsnap fetch extract
# echo "WITH_PKGNG=yes" >> /etc/make.conf
# make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg install clean

If this is an existing system it may be converted to pkg(7) as well by running:

# pkg2ng

After this is done /usr/ports may be removed if no longer required.

To workaround the configuration and keys being missed, apply the solution in
this Errata.

V.   Solution

No solution is provided for pkg(7) bootstrap signature checking on releases prior
to 10.0.  Upgrading to 10.0 or stable/9 after r263038 will suffice.

To install the configuration and public key in a secure means, perform one of
the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 9.2]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:03/pkg-en-releng-9.2.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:10/pkg-en-releng-9.2.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pkg-en-releng-9.2.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 9.1]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:03/pkg-en-releng-9.1.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:10/pkg-en-releng-9.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pkg-en-releng-9.1.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 8.4]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:03/pkg-en-releng-8.4.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:03/pkg-en-releng-8.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pkg-en-releng-8.4.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/etc/pkg
# mkdir -p /etc/pkg /usr/share/keys/pkg/trusted /usr/share/keys/pkg/revoked
# make install
# cd /usr/src/share/keys/pkg
# make install

3) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

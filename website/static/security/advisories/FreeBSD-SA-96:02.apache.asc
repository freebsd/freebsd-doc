=============================================================================

I.   Background    

     A bug was found in the apache daemon that may allow remote
     users to obtain unauthorized access to a machine running
     apache httpd.


II.  Problem Description

     Versions of the apache http daemon before release 1.05 do
     not properly restrict shell meta-characters transmitted to
     the daemon via form input (via GET or POST).


III. Impact

     The problem could allow remote users to gain unauthorized access
     to a system.  This problem is only exploitable on systems where
     the apache http daemon has been installed and is enabled.

     The apache http daemon is not installed or enabled by default
     but is a common package that many FreeBSD users may have chosen
     to install.

IV. Solution(s)

     The Apache Group released version 1.05 of the daemon which fixes
     this vulnerability.  The FreeBSD Project updated the ports and
     packages system to use this new daemon.

     Interested parties may obtain an updated pre-compiled FreeBSD
     package from:

     ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/packages-current/www/apache-1.0.5.tgz

     and an updated "automatic port" from the directory hierarchy:

     ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports-current/www/apache.tar.gz

V. Workaround

     This vulnerability can only be eliminated by updating to a more recent
     version of apache or by disabling apache httpd.

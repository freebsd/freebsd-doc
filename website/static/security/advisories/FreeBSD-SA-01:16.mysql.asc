Topic:          mysql may allow remote users to gain increased
                privileges

Category:       ports
Module:         mysql322-server/mysql323-server
Announced:      2001-01-29
Credits:        Nicolas GREGOIRE <nicolas.gregoire@7THZONE.COM>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.

Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

mysql is a high-performance database server.

II.  Problem Description

The mysql323-server port, versions prior to 3.23.22, and all
mysql322-server ports contain remote vulerabilities.  Due to a buffer
overflow, a malicious remote user can cause a denial-of-service by
crashing the database.  Additionally, the attacker may be able to gain
the privileges of the mysqld user, allowing access to all databases
and the ability to leverage other local attacks as the mysqld user.
In order to accomplish this, the attacker must have a valid mysql
account.

The mysql322-server and mysql323-server ports are not installed by
default, nor are they "part of FreeBSD" as such: they are part of the
FreeBSD ports collection, which contains over 4500 third-party
applications in a ready-to-install format.  The ports collections
shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this problem since it was
discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote mysql users may cause a denial-of-service and
potentially gain access as the mysqld user, allowing access to all
databases on the mysql server and the ability to leverage other local
attacks as the mysqld user.

If you have not chosen to install the mysql322-server or
mysql323-server ports/packages, then your system is not vulnerable to
this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the mysql322-server or mysql323-server port/package, if you
have installed it.

V.   Solution

Note: the mysql322-server port has been removed since mysql 3.23 is
now the stable mysql branch.  People using older mysql322-server
ports/packages are urged to update to the mysql323-server
port/package.

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the
mysql323-server port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/databases/mysql-3.23.32.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/databases/mysql-3.23.32.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/databases/mysql-3.23.32.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the mysql323-server port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

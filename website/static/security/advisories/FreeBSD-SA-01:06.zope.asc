                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          zope vulnerability allows escalation of privileges

Category:       ports
Module:         zope
Announced:      2001-01-15
Credits:        Erik Enge
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2000-12-20
Vendor status:  Patch released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

zope is an object-based dynamic web application platform.

II.  Problem Description

The zope port, versions prior to 2.2.4, contains a vulnerability due
to the computation of local roles not climbing the correct hierarchy
of folders, sometimes granting local roles inappropriately.  This may
allow users with privileges in one folder to gain the same privileges
in another folder.

The zope port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
nearly 4500 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.
The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this
problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Zope users with privileges in one folder may be able to gain the same
privileges in other folders.

If you have not chosen to install the zope port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the zope port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the zope port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/www/zope-2.2.4.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/www/zope-2.2.4.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/www/zope-2.2.4.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/www/zope-2.2.4.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/www/zope-2.2.4.tgz

3) download a new port skeleton for the zope port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

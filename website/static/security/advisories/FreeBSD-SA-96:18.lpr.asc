FreeBSD-SA-96:18					    Security Advisory

Topic:		Buffer overflow in lpr (revised)

Category:	core
Module:		lpr
Announced:	1996-11-25
Affects:	FreeBSD 2.0, 2.0.5, 2.1, 2.1.5
Corrected:	FreeBSD-current as of 1996/10/27
		FreeBSD-stable as of 1996/11/01
		FreeBSD 2.2 and 2.1.6 releases
FreeBSD only:	no

Patches:	ftp://freebsd.org/pub/CERT/patches/SA-96:18/

=============================================================================

I.   Background    

     The lpr program is used to print files. It is standard software
     in the FreeBSD operating system.

     This advisory is based on AUSCERT's advisory AA-96.12. The FreeBSD
     security-officers would like to thank AUSCERT for their efforts.

     This is a revised advisory, issued to state clearly exactly which
     versions of FreeBSD are vulnerable.

II.  Problem Description

     Due to its nature, the lpr program is setuid root. Unfortunately,
     the program does not do sufficient bounds checking on arguments which
     are supplied by users.  As a result it is possible to overwrite the
     internal stack space of the program while it's executing.  This can
     allow an intruder to execute arbitrary code by crafting a carefully
     designed argument to lpr.  As lpr runs as root this allows intruders
     to run arbitrary commands as root.


III. Impact
     Local users can gain root privileges.


IV. Workaround

     AUSCERT has developed a wrapper to help prevent lpr being exploited
     using this vulnerability.  This wrapper, including installation
     instructions, can be found in 
		ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/advisory/
			AA-96.12.lpr.buffer.overrun.vul

V. Solution

     Apply one of the following patches. Patches are provided for 
     FreeBSD-current (before 1996/10/27) (SA-96:18-solution.current)
     FreeBSD-2.0.5, FreeBSD-2.1.0, FreeBSD-2.1.5 and 
	FreeBSd-stable (before 1996/11/01) (SA-96:18-solution.2xx)

Topic:          make(1) syntax errors when upgrading from 9.x and earlier

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit

I.   Background

The FreeBSD userland and kernel build system ensures a seamless upgrade path
from the previous major FreeBSD version.  During source-based upgrades, the
build system must utilize several utilities on the running system in order to
bootstrap the build toolchain, after which the bootstrapped utilities are used
to produce the build output for the system upgrade.

The make(1) utility was replaced with the NetBSD bmake(1) utility as of
FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE, which has several syntactical differences compared to
the fmake(1) utility found in earlier FreeBSD releases.

II.  Problem Description

A hard-coded make(1) invocation in the FreeBSD 10.2 sources produce warnings
on FreeBSD versions earlier than 10.x due to a syntactical difference between
the FreeBSD and NetBSD versions of make(1).

The warnings may persist on FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE or 10.2-STABLE if the system
is configured to use fmake(1), by defining WITHOUT_BMAKE in src.conf(5).

III. Impact

The warnings produced have no known functional impact.  Additionally, the
warnings will not recur after the system is upgraded to 10.2-RELEASE or
10.2-STABLE, unless WITHOUT_BMAKE is defined in src.conf(5) as noted above.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems using binary upgrades such as
freebsd-update(8) are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Update the system sources to stable/10 or releng/10.2 dated after the
correction date prior to upgrading from FreeBSD 9.x or earlier.  No addtional
action is required.

2) To update your present system via a source code patch:

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:11/toolchain.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:11/toolchain.patch.asc
# gpg --verify toolchain.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

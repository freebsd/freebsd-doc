Topic:          Timezone database information update

Category:       contrib
Module:         zoneinfo
Announced:      2019-07-02
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2019-07-02 12:22:27 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
                2019-07-02 23:59:45 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p7)
                2019-07-02 12:22:54 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-PRERELEASE)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The tzsetup(8) program allows the user to specify the default local timezone.
Based on the selected timezone, tzsetup(8) copies one of the files from
/usr/share/zoneinfo to /etc/localtime.  This file actually controls the
conversion.

II.  Problem Description

Several changes in Daylight Savings Time happened after previous FreeBSD
releases were released that would affect many people who live in different
countries.  Because of these changes, the data in the zoneinfo files need to
be updated, and if the local timezone on the running system is affected,
tzsetup(8) needs to be run so the /etc/localtime is updated.

III. Impact

An incorrect time will be displayed on a system configured to use one of the
affected timezones if the /usr/share/zoneinfo and /etc/localtime files are
not updated, and all applications on the system that rely on the system time,
such as cron(8) and syslog(8), will be affected.

IV.  Workaround

The system administrator can install an updated timezone database from the
misc/zoneinfo port and run tzsetup(8) to get the timezone database corrected.

Applications that store and display times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
are not affected.

V.   Solution

Please note that some third party software, for instance PHP, Ruby, Java and
Perl, may be using different zoneinfo data source, in such cases this
software must be updated separately.  For software packages that is installed
via binary packages, they can be upgraded by executing `pkg upgrade'.

Following the instructions in this Errata Notice will update all of the
zoneinfo files to be the same as what was released with FreeBSD release.

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  Restart all the affected
applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart all the affected applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:12/tzdata-2019b.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:12/tzdata-2019b.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tzdata-2019b.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all the affected applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

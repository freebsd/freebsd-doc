Topic:          Jail fails to start if WITHOUT_INET/WITHOUT_INET6 is used

Category:       core
Module:         jail
Announced:      2014-07-08
Credits:        Eugene Grosbein, Chris Rees
Affects:        FreeBSD 8.4
Corrected:      2014-07-02 19:18:59 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)
                2014-07-08 21:55:39 UTC (releng/8.4, 8.4-RELEASE-p14)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:http://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

The jail(8) utility creates new jails, or modifies or removes existing
jails.

II.  Problem Description

The jail(8) rc(8) script used to start jails on the system does not
properly detect if an address protocol is in use on the system.

III. Impact

When the FreeBSD kernel and userland are built either without IPv4 or IPv6
support by defining WITHOUT_INET or WITHOUT_INET6 in src.conf(5), the jail(8)
will fail to start with an non-descriptive error.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, however systems that do not define WITHOUT_INET
or WITHOUT_INET6 are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:09/jail.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:09/jail.patch.asc
# gpg --verify jail.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

3) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

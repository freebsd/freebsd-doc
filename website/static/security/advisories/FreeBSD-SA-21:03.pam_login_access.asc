For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

login.access(5) is a system configuration file allowing administrators to
define policy around system login access by specific users and groups.  It
is implemented by a pam(3) module, pam_login_access(8), and is configured
by default for accesses via sshd(8), telnetd(8) and the system console.

II.  Problem Description

A regression in the login.access(5) rule processor has the effect of causing
rules to fail to match even when they should not.  This means that rules
denying access may be ignored.

III. Impact

The configuration in login.access(5) may not be applied, permitting login
access to users even when the system is configured to deny it.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems not relying on login.access(5) to
enforce custom login policies are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:03/pam_login_access.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:03/pam_login_access.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pam_login_access.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

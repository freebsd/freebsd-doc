For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

OPIE is a one-time password system designed to help to secure a system
against replay attacks.  It does so using a secure hash function and a
challenge/response system.

OPIE is enabled by default on FreeBSD.

II.  Problem Description

A programming error in the OPIE library could allow an off-by-one buffer
overflow to write a single zero byte beyond the end of an on-stack buffer.

III. Impact

An attacker can remotely crash a service process which uses OPIE when
stack protector is enabled.

Note that this can happen even if OPIE is not enabled on the system,
for instance the base system ftpd(8) is affected by this.  Depending
on the design and usage of OPIE, this may either affect only the
process that handles the user authentication, or cause a Denial of
Service condition.

It is possible but very unlikely that an attacker could exploit this to
gain access to a system.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems without OPIE capable services
running are not vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE, 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE,
or to the RELENG_8_0, RELENG_7_3, RELENG_7_2, RELENG_7_1, RELENG_6_4
security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.4,
7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-10:05/opie.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-10:05/opie.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libopie
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

NOTE: On the amd64 platform, the above procedure will not update the
lib32 (i386 compatibility) libraries.  On amd64 systems where the i386
compatibility libraries are used, the operating system should instead
be recompiled as described in
<URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running 6.4-RELEASE, 7.1-RELEASE, 7.2-RELEASE, 7.3-RELEASE or
8.0-RELEASE on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

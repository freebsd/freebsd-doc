For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

The freebsd-update(8) utility is used to apply binary patches to FreeBSD
systems installed from official release images, as an alternative to
rebuilding from source.  A freebsd-update(8) build server generates the
signed update packages, consisting of an index of files and directories
with checksums before the update, a set of binary patches, and an
index of files and directories with checksums after the update.  The
client downloads the indexes, verifies the signatures and checksums,
then downloads and applies the required patches.

II.  Problem Description

Binary upgrades using the freebsd-update(8) utility consist of several
invocations of the freebsd-update(8) utility itself.  Each invocation
performs a different task that depends on the previous invocation being
successfully completed.

If an upgrade is not thoroughly completed, it is possible for the
freebsd-update(8) utility to download a subsequent patchset to a system
with an inconsistent userland and/or kernel.  In the case of such an
incomplete upgrade, the freebsd-update(8) utility may incorrectly
evaluate the running userland and/or kernel, which can cause binary
patches to be incorrectly applied.  In some situations, it is possible
for patches to be applied for the incorrect FreeBSD version.

III. Impact

If incorrect patches are applied to the system as a result of a previous
incomplete upgrade, it is possible that some system services may fail to
start after rebooting the system, such as if the service is started by an
executable that depends on a shared library that has been relocated as
part of the upgrade.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that do not use FreeBSD-provided
binary updates to upgrade are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 9.3 and 10.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:04/freebsd-update.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:04/freebsd-update.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 8.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:04/freebsd-update-8.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:04/freebsd-update-8.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update-8.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

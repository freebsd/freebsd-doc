Topic:          Regression in Heimdal KDC

Category:       contrib
Module:         heimdal
Announced:      2022-11-29
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2022-11-18 01:09:42 UTC (stable/13, 13.1-STABLE)
                2022-11-29 23:04:48 UTC (releng/13.1, 13.1-RELEASE-p5)
                2022-11-18 01:10:53 UTC (stable/12, 12.4-STABLE)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

Heimdal implements the Kerberos 5 network authentication protocols.

A Key Distribution Center (KDC) is trusted by all principals registered
in that administrative "realm" to store a secret key in confidence, of
which, the proof of knowledge is used to verify the authenticity of a
principal.

FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal corrected multiple vulnerabilities in the Heimdal
implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication protocols and KDC
included as part of the FreeBSD base system.

II.  Problem Description

The patch released with FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal included an inadvertently
merged block of code which prevents the KDC from issuing valid tickets.

III. Impact

A system patched with FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal will have a defective KDC.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems that were not updated with the patch from
FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal are not affected.  Note that unpatched systems are
vulnerable to multiple security issues.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

A reboot is recommended.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

A reboot is recommended.

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:28/heimdal.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:28/heimdal.patch.asc
# gpg --verify heimdal.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use Kerberos, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              b23fe6badeba    stable/13-n253102
releng/13.1/                            10571c04c9dd  releng/13.1-n250173
stable/12/                                                        r372759
releng/12.4/                                                      r372779
releng/12.3/                                                      r372776
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

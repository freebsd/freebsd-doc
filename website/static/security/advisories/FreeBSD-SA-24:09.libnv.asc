Note: This advisory provided an incomplete fix for the issues described as
CVE-2024-45287 that were further addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:16.libnv. Please
refer to that advisory for additional fixes.

0.   Revision History

v1.0 2024-09-04 -- Initial release
v1.1 2024-09-19 -- Add reference to SA-24:16.libnv

I.   Background

libnv (also called nvlist) is a general-purpose library designed for storing
name-value pairs.  This library can serve as an Inter-Process Communication
(IPC) framework, enabling processes to exchange data.  For example, it is
used in libcasper to communicate between privileged and unprivileged
processes. Additionally, libnv can function as an interface for communication
between userland and kernel.

Originally, libnv was inspired by OpenZFS nvlist. However, the
implementations are separate. This advisory is only about base system
implementation of libnv, not a OpenZFS one.

II.  Problem Description

CVE-2024-45287 is a vulnerability that affects both the kernel and userland.
A malicious value of size in a structure of packed libnv can cause an integer
overflow, leading to the allocation of a smaller buffer than required for the
parsed data.

CVE-2024-45288 is a vulnerability that affects both the kernel and userland.
A missing null-termination character in the last element of an nvlist array
string can lead to writing outside the allocated buffer.

III. Impact

It is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory (in userland
or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller than the data
received from a malicious process. This vulnerability could result in
privilege escalation or cause a system panic.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date
and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:09/libnv.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:09/libnv.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libnv.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

d) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

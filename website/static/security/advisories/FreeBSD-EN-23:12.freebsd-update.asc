                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          freebsd-update to 14.0 fails

Category:       core
Module:         freebsd-update
Announced:      2023-10-03
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2023-10-01 16:33:03 UTC (stable/13, 13.2-STABLE)
                2023-10-03 21:22:19 UTC (releng/13.2, 13.2-RELEASE-p4)
                2023-10-01 16:35:16 UTC (stable/12, 12.4-STABLE)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

freebsd-update provides binary updates for supported releases of FreeBSD on
amd64, arm64, and i386.

II.  Problem Description

freebsd-update was unable to handle the case where a file in the "old"
version changed to a directory in the "new" version.  This case occurs with
upgrades to FreeBSD 14.0, as /usr/include/c++/v1/__string exists as a file
in 12.4 and 13.2, and as a directory in FreeBSD 14.0.

III. Impact

Using freebsd-update to upgrade to FreeBSD 14.0 emits errors during install
and results in a system with broken C++ headers.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-23:12/freebsd-update.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-23:12/freebsd-update.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              774cc6348a50    stable/13-n256442
releng/13.2/                            cfb624d7e250  releng/13.2-n254634
stable/12/                                                        r373223
releng/12.4/                                                      r373232
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

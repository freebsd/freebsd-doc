Topic:          Incorrect build host Clang version detection

Category:       core
Module:         build
Announced:      2020-05-12
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected:      2020-02-18 18:03:04 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
                2020-04-29 18:51:34 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p5)
                2020-02-18 18:03:04 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-STABLE)
                2020-04-29 18:59:37 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p9)

Note: The upcoming release of FreeBSD 11.4 was branched after the original
commit to the stable branch and already includes this errata.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD's build system detects the host compiler version and uses that to
control certain actions during the build. 

II.  Problem Description

The Clang and LLD version detection accepted only versions matching the shell
glob pattern [1-9].[0-9]*, which notably does not include 10.0.  The build
then proceeded as if the compiler or linker version was 0.0.

III. Impact

Attempting to build 12.1-RELEASE on 13-CURRENT failed.  The version detection
issue also affects 11.3-RELEASE (although the build does not fail).

This issue only affects attempts to build FreeBSD 12.1 or 11.3 on a -CURRENT
host.

IV.  Workaround

Install 11.3-RELEASE or 12.1-RELEASE on the build host.  No action is
required when building 11.3 on an 11.3 host, or 12.1 on a 12.1 host.  

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 12.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:10/build.12.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:10/build.12.patch.asc
# gpg --verify build.12.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 11.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:10/build.11.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:10/build.11.patch.asc
# gpg --verify build.11.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

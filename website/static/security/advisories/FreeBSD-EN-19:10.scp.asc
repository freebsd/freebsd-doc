0.   Revision history

v1.0   Initial release.
v1.1   Correct patch level for 12.0-RELEASE.

I.   Background

scp(1) is a file transfer protocol running over an SSH session.

II.  Problem Description

The scp(1) client implementation fails to verify if the objects returned by
the server match what was requested.

III. Impact

A malicious scp server can write arbitrary files to the client.

IV.  Workaround

Switch to using the sftp(1) client, if possible.

V.   Solution

Note: While stable/11 and its release branches are currently affected by this
errata, due to the lack of patches, no fix is currently available for
stable/11.  We are currently evaluating a backport for these fixes to
stable/11.

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 12.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:10/scp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:10/scp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify scp.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

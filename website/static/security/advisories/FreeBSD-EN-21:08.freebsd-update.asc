For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

freebsd-update provides binary updates for supported releases of FreeBSD on
amd64 and i386.

II.  Problem Description

The existing logic to try and avoid regenerating passwd/login.conf files
relies on timestamp comparisons between old and new files, with the caveat
that it's comparing the installed with a timestamp that has been clobbered to
do the comparison.

III. Impact

User and login.conf changes coming in from a binary update may not properly
regenerate the databases for the changes to take effect.

IV.  Workaround

To workaround this issue, one may regenerate databases manually with
pwd_mkdb(8) and cap_mkdb(1), e.g.,

pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd
cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  No reboot is required.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:08/freebsd-update.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:08/freebsd-update.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

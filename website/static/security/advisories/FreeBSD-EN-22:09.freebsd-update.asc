Topic:          freebsd-update creating erroneous boot environments

Category:       core
Module:         freebsd-update
Announced:      2022-03-15
Affects:        FreeBSD 12.3
Corrected:      2022-02-15 06:09:41 UTC (stable/12, 12.3-STABLE)
                2022-03-15 18:17:55 UTC (releng/12.3, 12.3-RELEASE-p3)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

By default, freebsd-update(8) is configured to create new ZFS boot environments
on systems that are compatible with bectl(8).

II.  Problem Description

When updating a jail or another root that isn't the system root using -b,
freebsd-update(8) will create a spurious boot environment despite the updated
root not causing a change in the boot environment.

III. Impact

Users that have used freebsd-update(8) with the -b or -j flags may have some
extra boot environments present on the system that did not meaningfully impact
the boot environment.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems with "CreateBootEnv" set to "no" in their
/etc/freebsd-update.conf are not affected.  Systems that do not use ZFS are also
not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  No reboot is required.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 12.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:09/freebsd-update.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:09/freebsd-update.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

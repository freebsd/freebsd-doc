Topic:          Memory disclosure vulnerability in libalias

Category:       core
Module:         libalias
Announced:      2020-05-12
Credits:        Vishnu Dev TJ working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected:      2020-05-12 16:52:08 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
                2020-05-12 16:54:39 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p5)

CVE Name:       CVE-2020-7455

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The ipfw(4) system facility allows IP packet filtering, redirecting, and
traffic accounting.  The ipfw(4) packet filter also contains two different
methods of accomplishing network address translation (NAT): in-kernel and
userspace.  Both implementations use the same functions provided by libalias.

The libalias(3) library is a collection of functions for aliasing and
dealiasing of IP packets, intended for masquerading and NAT.  Additionally,
libalias(3) includes modules to support protocols that require additional
logic to support address translation.

Note: libalias(3) is not used by either the pf(4) or ipf(4) firewalls.

II.  Problem Description

The FTP packet handler in libalias incorrectly calculates some packet
lengths.  This may result in disclosing small amounts of memory from the
kernel (for the in-kernel NAT implementation) or from the process space for
natd (for the userspace implementation).

III. Impact

A malicious attacker could send specially constructed packets that exploit the
erroneous calculation allowing the attacker to disclose small amount of memory
either from the kernel (for the in-kernel NAT implementation) or from the
process space for natd (for the userspace implementation).

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Only systems using NAT and ipfw together are
affected.  Systems using ipfw without NAT, or systems leveraging pf(4) or
ipf(4) are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:13/libalias.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:13/libalias.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libalias.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

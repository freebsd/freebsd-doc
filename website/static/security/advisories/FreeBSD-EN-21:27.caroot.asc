FreeBSD-EN-21:27.caroot                                         Errata Notice
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Root certificate bundle update

Category:       core
Module:         caroot
Announced:      2021-11-03
Affects:        FreeBSD 12.2 and later.
Corrected:      2021-09-04 07:39:07 UTC (stable/13, 13.0-STABLE)
                2021-11-03 20:37:26 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p5)
                2021-09-04 07:39:03 UTC (stable/12, 12.2-STABLE)
                2021-11-03 20:55:26 UTC (releng/12.2, 12.2-RELEASE-p11)

Note:  Systems running FreeBSD 12.3-BETA are unaffected.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The root certificate bundle is the trust store that is used by OpenSSL
programs and libraries to aide in determining whether it should trust
a given TLS certificate.

II.  Problem Description

Several certificates were removed from the bundle after the latest release
of FreeBSD 12.2 and FreeBSD 13.0.  Additionally, an oversight in the root
bundle processor included some roots that were not intended to be trusted for
these purposes (SERVER_AUTH).

III. Impact

Certificates are often removed from the root bundle due to a failure to
meet the standards established by Mozilla for being considered a trusted
Certificate Authority.  Continuing to trust roots despite their removal from
the bundle should be considered risky.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Software that uses an internal trust store
is not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 13.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:27/caroot.13.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:27/caroot.13.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot.13.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 12.2]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:27/caroot.12.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:27/caroot.12.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot.12.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all applications that may be using OpenSSL, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              62aaa70143a6    stable/13-n247098
releng/13.0/                            b76aaa35423e  releng/13.0-n244762
stable/12/                                                        r370507
releng/12.2/                                                      r370978
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

Topic:          Incorrect validation in rad_get_attr(3)

Category:       core
Module:         libradius
Announced:      2021-06-01
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2021-05-28 17:00:19 UTC (stable/13, 13.0-STABLE)
                2021-06-01 20:26:32 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p2)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

libradius(3) is a client and server library implementing the Remote
Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol.  It is used by
pam_radius(8) and mpd5 (available in the ports tree as net/mpd5).

II.  Problem Description

The patch for FreeBSD-SA-21:12.libradius modified rad_get_attr(3) to
verify that an attribute length smaller than the minimum required for
the attribute type and length fields is disallowed.  This check may fail
incorrectly for the final attribute in a RADIUS message.

III. Impact

The bug may cause request validation to fail when it should succeed.
This can result in errors in applications making using of libradius(3).

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems not using libradius(3) are unaffected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:17/libradius.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:17/libradius.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libradius.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

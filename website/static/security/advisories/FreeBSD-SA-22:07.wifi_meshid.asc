CVE Name:       CVE-2022-23088

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD's net80211 kernel subsystem provides infrastructure and drivers
for IEEE 802.11 wireless (Wi-Fi) communications.

II.  Problem Description

The 802.11 beacon handling routine failed to validate the length of an
IEEE 802.11s Mesh ID before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer.

III. Impact

While a FreeBSD Wi-Fi client is in scanning mode (i.e., not associated with
a SSID) a malicious beacon frame may overwrite kernel memory, leading to
remote code execution.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems not using Wi-Fi are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-22:07/wifi_meshid.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-22:07/wifi_meshid.patch.asc
# gpg --verify wifi_meshid.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              72617f9246e3    stable/13-n250273
releng/13.1/                            00cc1ce78da3  releng/13.1-n250079
releng/13.0/                            b2b23824272d  releng/13.0-n244797
stable/12/                                                        r371868
releng/12.3/                                                      r371873
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

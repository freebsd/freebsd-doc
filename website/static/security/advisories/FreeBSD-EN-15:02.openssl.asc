For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

II.  Problem Description

The OpenSSL software bundled with the FreeBSD base system has been diverged
due to various security advisories in the past and some reliability fixes
were not merged.

III. Impact

Divergence in the cryptographic code makes it harder to review changes, and
running unique code exposes users who run FreeBSD to possible unique bugs,
if there is any.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that do not use base system OpenSSL
for public facing services are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 8.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-8.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-8.4.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-9.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-9.3.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-10.0.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-10.0.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-10.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:02/openssl-10.1.patch.asc

# gpg --verify XXXX.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

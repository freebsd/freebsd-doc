Topic:          net.pf.request_maxcount not settable from loader.conf(5)

Category:       core
Module:         pf
Announced:      2021-04-06
Affects:        FreeBSD 12.2
Corrected:      2020-12-15 08:29:45 UTC (stable/12, 12.2-STABLE)
                2021-04-06 19:21:24 UTC (releng/12.2, 12.2-RELEASE-p6)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security

I.   Background

pf(4) is an Internet Protocol packet filter originally written for OpenBSD.

II.  Problem Description

The net.pf.request_maxcount sysctl provides an upper bound on the amount of
memory used by pf(4) to store various types of state.  Prior to FreeBSD 12.2
this sysctl was read-only and could only be adjusted via loader.conf(5).  In
FreeBSD 12.2, the sysctl was made writeable, but lost the ability to be
adjusted from loader.conf(5).

III. Impact

pf(4) may fail to load filtering rules if they cause the default
request_maxcount bound to be exceeded.  Users that relied on loader.conf to
increase the request_maxcount value could see their rules fail to load. 

IV.  Workaround

The value of request_maxcount may be set via sysctl.conf(5).

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:09/pf.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:09/pf.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pf.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit

I.   Background

SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library.  Programs that link the
SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS
process.  The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access
program (sqlite3) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which
serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.

II.  Problem Description

According to https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html, the
vulnerabilities known as Magellan are a group vulnerabilities that exist
in sqlite3, documented by CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505, and CVE-2018-20506.

When the FTS3 extension is enabled an integer overflow resulting in a buffer
overflow when allowing remote attackers to run arbitrary SQL statements which
can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

III. Impact

The vulnerabilities were discovered by Tencent Blade Team and verified to be
able to successfully implement remote code execution in Chromium browsers.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 11.2]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:03/sqlite-11.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:03/sqlite-11.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sqlite-11.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 12.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:03/sqlite-12.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-19:03/sqlite-12.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sqlite-12.patch.asc


b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit

I.   Background

The Network File System (NFS) allows a system to share directories and files
with others over a network.  By using this, users and programs can access
files on remote systems almost as if they were local files.

The rpc.rquotad utility is an rpc(3) server which returns quotas for a user
of a local file system which is NFS-mounted onto a remote machine.

II.  Problem Description

A change in rpc.rquotad made it send RQUOTA v2 requests instead of RQUOTA v1
requests.  Some vendors would send RPC_PROGNOTREGISTERED ("Program Not
Registered") response instead of the desired RPC_PROGVERSMISMATCH ("Program
Version Mismatch") response, preventing the mechanism from working.

III. Impact

The quota(8) command will not be able obtain quota information for some NFS
server vendors.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems not using quotas on NFS mounted file
systems are unaffected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:07/quotad.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-20:07/quotad.patch.asc
# gpg --verify quotad.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

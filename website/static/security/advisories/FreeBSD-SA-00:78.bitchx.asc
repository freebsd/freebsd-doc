0.   Revision History

v1.0  2000-12-20  Initial release
v1.1  2000-12-29  Noted the vulnerability of ko-bitchx also

I.   Background

bitchx is a popular IRC client. It is available in a Korean-localized
version as the ko-bitchx package.

II.  Problem Description

The bitchx port, versions prior to 1.0c17_1, and ko-bitchx port,
versions prior to 1.0c16_3, contains a remote vulnerability.  Through
a stack overflow in the DNS parsing code, a malicious remote user in
control of their reverse DNS records may crash a bitchx session, or
cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user running bitchx.

The bitchx/ko-bitchx ports are not installed by default, nor are they
"part of FreeBSD" as such: they are part of the FreeBSD ports
collection, which contains over 4300 third-party applications in a
ready-to-install format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD
3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this problem since it was discovered after the
releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may execute arbitrary code as the user running
bitchx.
 
If you have not chosen to install the bitchx or ko-bitchx
port/packages, then your system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the bitchx and/or ko-bitchx port/packages, if you have
installed them.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the bitchx or
ko-bitchx ports.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

NOTE: It may be several days before updated ko-bitchx packages are
available.

3) download a new port skeleton for the bitchx/ko-bitchx port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

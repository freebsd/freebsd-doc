Topic:          CAM ioctl(2) compatibility breakage

Category:       core
Module:         cam
Announced:      2022-11-01
Affects:        FreeBSD 13.1
Corrected:      2022-10-13 00:44:16 UTC (stable/13, 13.1-STABLE)
                2022-11-01 13:28:11 UTC (releng/13.1, 13.1-RELEASE-p3)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

CAM (Common Access Method) is a FreeBSD kernel subsystem which handles
various aspects of storage management.  Various CAM components expose
an ioctl(2) interface to userspace.

II.  Problem Description

A backwards-incompatible change to the CAM ioctl interface was made.
Partial compatibility support for the old version of the interface was
provided, but it was incomplete.  In particular, CAM periph drivers
did not handle the old version of the CAMGETPASSTHRU ioctl.

III. Impact

Software applications which make use of the CAM ioctl(2) interface
may fail to work following an upgrade to FreeBSD 13.1.

IV.  Workaround

Affected applications can be recompiled on FreeBSD 13.1.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +5min "Installing errata update"

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:26/cam.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:26/cam.patch.asc
# gpg --verify cam.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              16d4c1de7b40    stable/13-n252721
releng/13.1/                            fff5c5fe911e  releng/13.1-n250161
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

FreeBSD-EN-22:15.pf                                       Errata Notice
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          pf(4) tables may fail to load

Category:       core
Module:         pf
Announced:      2022-04-06
Affects:        FreeBSD 13.0
Corrected:      2022-04-06 03:04:11 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p11)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

pf is an Internet Protocol packet filter originally written for OpenBSD.
pf rules may reference address tables when applying policies to large
sets of source or destination addresses.  pf rulesets may optionally set
a limit on the number of table entries allocated by the kernel, via the
"set limit" pf.conf(5) syntax.

II.  Problem Description

pf rulesets that set a limit on the number of table entries and include
one or more address tables may occasionally fail to load.  An initial
load of the rules will succeed, but an attempt to re-load can fail.  In
this case, the problem persists until the system is rebooted.

III. Impact

Administrators may be prevented from modifying or updating pf rule
sets.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date, and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for an errata update"

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:15/pf.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:15/pf.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pf.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
releng/13.0/                            5b789e0c92a7  releng/13.0-n244792
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

Topic:          Fix kernel panic in vmci driver initialization

Category:       core
Module:         vmci
Announced:      2021-11-03
Affects:        FreeBSD 12.x, FreeBSD 13.0
Corrected:      2021-10-16 18:22:43 UTC (stable/13, 13.0-STABLE)
                2021-11-03 20:40:19 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p5)
                2021-10-17 18:51:19 UTC (stable/12, 12.2-STABLE)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The vmci(4) driver implements VMware Virtual Machine Communication Interface
for FreeBSD. It allows virtual machines to communicate with host kernel modules
and VMware hypervisors.

II.  Problem Description

An error during driver initialization results in a kernel panic due to unallocated
resources being freed up.

III. Impact

The vmci(4) driver is loaded automatically by devd when the system is being
run on the VMWare hypervisor.  The kernel panic happens at the system boot stage.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r now

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:28/vmci.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-21:28/vmci.patch.asc
# gpg --verify vmci.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision

stable/13/                              4e5c1be4202a    stable/13-n247688
releng/13.0/                            847819dca14d  releng/13.0-n244763
stable/12/                                                        r370935
releng/12.2/                                                      r370979
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For FreeBSD 13 and later:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>

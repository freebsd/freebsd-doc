For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:http://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

The freebsd-update(8) utility is used to download and apply binary diffs
for security and errata patches on systems installed from official FreeBSD
release CDs and DVDs.  It can also be used to upgrade such systems to new
FreeBSD releases.

In the preceding Errata Notice (FreeBSD-EN-13:04.freebsd-update), a change
was made to freebsd-update(8) to cause it to create directories appearing
in a new release before creating other filesystem objects; and to delete
directories which no longer appeared after other filesystem objects had
been removed.

II.  Problem Description

An typographical error caused the directories needing to be deleted to be
incorrectly enumerated.  In particular, the /var/empty directory was being
removed when upgrading from earlier releases to FreeBSD 10.0-BETA3.

III. Impact

After upgrading to FreeBSD 10.0-BETA3 some daemons, including sshd(8),
will not start.

IV.  Workaround

To manually recreate the /var/empty directory on systems where it was
inadvertently removed, run the following commands:

# mkdir /var/empty
# chflags schg /var/empty

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-13:05/freebsd-update.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-13:05/freebsd-update.patch.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd-update.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Reinstall freebsd-update.

# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/freebsd-update
# make install -DWITHOUT_MAN

3) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

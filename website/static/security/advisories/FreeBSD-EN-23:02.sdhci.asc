                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          sdhci(4) broken write-protect settings

Category:       core
Module:         sdhci
Announced:      2023-02-08
Affects:        FreeBSD 13.1
Corrected:      2022-03-29 22:24:27 UTC (stable/13, 13.1-STABLE)
                2023-02-08 16:16:32023-02-08 16:16:31.1-RELEASE-p6)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The sdhci(4) driver supports PCI devices with class 8 and subclass 5
according to the SD Host Controller Specification.  One of the devices
supported is the Marvell Xenon SDHCI controller.

II.  Problem Description

The write-protect flag on Marvell Xenon SDHCI controllers was incorrectly
handled, resulting in devices being erroneously marked as read-only.

III. Impact

On affected systems, SD cards cannot be written to; where an SD card is used
as the root device, this may result in the system failing to boot.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +5min "Installing errata update"

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-23:02/sdhci.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-23:02/sdhci.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sdhci.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/                              693af80b7435    stable/13-n250156
releng/13.1/                            4b31a7861af0  releng/13.1-n250176
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

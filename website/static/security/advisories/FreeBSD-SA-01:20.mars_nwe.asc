Topic:          mars_nwe contains potential remote root compromise

Category:       ports
Module:         mars_nwe
Announced:      2001-02-07
Credits:        Przemyslaw Frasunek <venglin@FREEBSD.LUBLIN.PL>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-01-30
Vendor status:  Vendor notified
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

mars_nwe is a Novell Netware server emulator.

II.  Problem Description

The mars_nwe port, versions prior to 0.99.b19_1, contains a remote
format string vulerability.  Because of this vulnerability, a
malicious remote user sending specially-crafted packets may be able to
execute arbitrary code on the local system, potentially gaining root
access.

The mars_nwe port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 4500 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2
contain this problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may cause arbitrary code to be executed
on the local system, potentially gaining root access.

If you have not chosen to install the mars_nwe port/package, then
your system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the mars_nwe port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the mars_nwe port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/net/mars_nwe-0.99.b19_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/net/mars_nwe-0.99.b19_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/net/mars_nwe-0.99.b19_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/net/mars_nwe-0.99.b19_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/net/mars_nwe-0.99.b19_1.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the mars_nwe port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

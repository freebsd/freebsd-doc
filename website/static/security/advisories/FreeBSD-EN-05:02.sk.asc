Topic:          sk(4) driver instability on SMP systems

Category:       core
Module:         sys_pci
Announced:      2005-01-06
Credits:        Peter Edwards, John-Mark Gurney, David O'Brien, Bjoern A. Zeeb
Affects:        FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE
Corrected:      2005-01-06 17:54:47 UTC

I.   Background

The sk(4) network driver provides support for SysKonnect-based Gigabit
Ethernet adapters.

II.  Problem Description

Several programming errors were discovered in the sk(4) network driver,
including an off-by-one error and a missing lock.

III. Impact

FreeBSD symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems using the sk(4) network
driver may experience data corruption or system crashes.  Symptoms
include panics, page faults, aborted SSH connections, and corrupted file
transfers.

IV.   Solution

Do one of the following to update the source tree:

  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to the RELENG_5_3 errata branch dated
     after the correction date using cvsup(1) or cvs(1).  This is the
     preferred method.

  2) Obtain the updated files using the cvsweb interface.  Cvsweb is a
     Web interface to the CVS repository.  The URL to the general
     interface is "http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/".  You can
     obtain any of the source files for the RELENG_5_3 branch by going
     to the src  directory ("http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src")
     and then selecting the "RELENG_5_3" branch tag.  With the branch
     tag set navigate to the files listed below in the "Correction
     details" section and download them, making sure you get the correct
     revision numbers.  Copy the downloaded files into your /usr/src tree.

If using the second procedure you should make sure you have used that
same procedure to download all previous Errata Notices and Security
Advisories.  We strongly discourage this procedure due to the problems
that may be caused by not doing that - using the first procedure takes
care of making sure all updates get applied.

Then follow the normal procedures for rebuilding/reinstalling the kernel.
Details about rebuilding/reinstalling are available here:

  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

V.  Correction details

FreeBSD-SA-98:08                                            Security Advisory
                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          IP fragmentation denial of service

Category:       core
Module:         kernel
Announced:      1998-11-04
Affects:        FreeBSD 3.0 and
		FreeBSD-current before the correction date.
Corrected:      FreeBSD-3.0 and FreeBSD-current as of 1998/10/27
FreeBSD only:   Yes

Patches:        ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-98:08/

I.   Background

IP connections are controlled through a series of packets that are
received by the two computers involved in the connection.
When packets are too large to be sent in a single IP packet (due to
interface hardware limitations for example), they can be fragmented
(unless prohibited by the Don't Fragment flag).
The final destination will reassemble all the fragments of an IP packet
and pass it to higher protocol layers (like TCP or UDP).

II.  Problem Description

There is a bug in the IP fragment reassembly code that might lead
to a kernel panic. An attacker can create and send a pair of
malformed IP packets which are then reassembled into an invalid
UDP datagram. Such an UDP datagram would then cause a server to
panic and crash.


III. Impact

When this bug is exploited the operating system will panic. This results
in a reboot of the system.
This vulnerability has been discussed in public security forums and
exploit programs are circulating to take advantage of this bug.


IV.  Workaround

None.

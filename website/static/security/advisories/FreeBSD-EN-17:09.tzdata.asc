For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The tzsetup(8) program allows the user to specify the default local
timezone.  Based on the selected timezone, tzsetup(8) copies one of the
files from /usr/share/zoneinfo to /etc/localtime.  This file actually
controls the conversion.

II.  Problem Description

Several changes in Daylight Savings Time happened after previous
FreeBSD releases were released that would affect many people who
live in different countries.  Because of these changes, the data in
the zoneinfo files need to be updated, and if the local timezone on
the running system is affected, tzsetup(8) needs to be run so the
/etc/localtime is updated.

III. Impact

An incorrect time will be displayed on a system configured to use one
of the affected timezones if the /usr/share/zoneinfo and /etc/localtime
files are not updated, and all applications on the system that rely on
the system time, such as cron(8) and syslog(8), will be affected.

IV.  Workaround

The system administrator can install an updated timezone database from
the misc/zoneinfo port and run tzsetup(8) to get the timezone database
corrected.

Applications that store and display times in Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) are not affected.

V.   Solution

Please note that some third party software, for instance PHP, Ruby,
Java and Perl, may be using different zoneinfo data source, in such
cases these software has to be updated separately.  For software
packages that is installed via package collection, they can be
upgraded by doing a `pkg upgrade'.

Following the instructions in this Errata Notice will update all of
the zoneinfo files to be the same as what was released with FreeBSD
release.

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date. Restart all the affected
applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart all the affected applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-11.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-11.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tzdata-11.1.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-11.0.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-11.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tzdata-11.0.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-10.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-10.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tzdata-10.4.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.3]

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:09/tzdata-10.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tzdata-10.3.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all the affected applications and daemons, or reboot the system.

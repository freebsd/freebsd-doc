For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

Recent FreeBSD releases have support to thread-safe and extended locale API,
modeled after the Darwin xlocale(3) API.

The C standard locale API was reimplemented as a wrapper of the xlocale(3)
API with a global locale in order to support its semantics.

II.  Problem Description

The locale and rune locale may become out of sync, in which case calls of
mb* and similar functions would be supplied with wrong data.

III. Impact

Applications that uses xlocale but does not call setlocale(3) would crash.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your present system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:09/xlocale.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-15:09/xlocale.patch.asc
# gpg --verify xlocale.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

Topic:          kqueue_close(2) page fault on exit using rfork(2)

Category:       core
Module:         kqueue
Announced:      2024-02-14
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2023-12-05 00:43:27 UTC (stable/14, 14.0-STABLE)
                2024-02-14 06:05:42 UTC (releng/14.0, 14.0-RELEASE-p5)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The kqueue(2) system call provides a generic method of notifying the user
when an event happens or a condition holds.

II.  Problem Description

Normally, when a process exits, all its kqueue fds will be destroyed at the
moment p_klist is detached.  However, if the process was created with rfork(2)
with shared file descriptors, its signal knotes can survive.  This can
eventually result in a page fault when the process exits.

III. Impact

Using kqueue(2) with a process using rfork(2) can panic the system.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date, and reboot the system.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Reboot the system.

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:03/kqueue.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:03/kqueue.patch.asc
# gpg --verify kqueue.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

Corrected:      2022-08-09 20:11:00 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p12)

Note: The corrected date and patch revision above (p12) are specific to the

      in the table below reference the git repository information, which was

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD's net80211 kernel subsystem provides infrastructure and drivers
for IEEE 802.11 wireless (Wi-Fi) communications.

II.  Problem Description

FreeBSD-SA-22:02.wifi included a number of improvements to net80211 data
validation.  Some of these changes were not included in the patch provided
for FreeBSD 13.0 and via freebsd-update.  The changes were included in the
git repository.

III. Impact

The interface affected by the missing change is only available to the
superuser.  The superuser may be able to cause kernel crash.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date, and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +5min "Installing errata update"

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:18/wifi.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-22:18/wifi.patch.asc
# gpg --verify wifi.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
releng/13.0/                            0d1db5c3257e  releng/13.0-n244782
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

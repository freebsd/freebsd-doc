Topic:          Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities

Category:       contrib
Module:         openssl
Announced:      2015-12-05
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2015-12-03 21:18:48 UTC (stable/10, 10.2-STABLE)
                2015-12-05 09:53:58 UTC (releng/10.2, 10.2-RELEASE-p8)
                2015-12-05 09:53:58 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p25)
                2015-12-03 21:24:40 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)
                2015-12-05 09:53:58 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p31)
CVE Name:       CVE-2015-3194, CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-3196

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

II.  Problem Description

The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference
if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent
mask generation function parameter. [CVE-2015-3194]

When presented with a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure, OpenSSL will leak
memory. [CVE-2015-3195]

If PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client then the values
are incorrectly updated in the parent SSL_CTX structure.  [CVE-2015-3196]

III. Impact

A remote attacker who can present a specifically crafted certificate may
cause a OpenSSL client or server application that performs certificate
signature verification to crash with a NULL pointer dereference, resulting
in a Denial of Service. [CVE-2015-3194]  This affects FreeBSD 10.x only.

An attacker who is able to feed specifically crafted PKCS#7/CMS data to an
OpenSSL application can cause memory leak which may eventually result in a
Denial of Service. [CVE-2015-3195]

A remote attacker who can send PSK identity hints to a multi-thread client
may trigger a double fault of hint data, which may lead to crash the client
application. [CVE-2015-3196].  This affects FreeBSD 10.1 only.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Reboot is optional but recommended.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Reboot is optional but recommended.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-9.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-9.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.3.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-10.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-10.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.1.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.2]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-10.2.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:26/openssl-10.2.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.2.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

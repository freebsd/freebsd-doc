For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The root certificate bundle is the trust store that is used by OpenSSL
programs and libraries to aid in determining whether it should trust a given
TLS certificate.

II.  Problem Description

Several certificates were added to the bundle after the latest release of
FreeBSD 13.4, 13.5, and 14.2.

III. Impact

TLS connections using the missing root certificates as a trust anchor would
not be trusted causing an error.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available. Software that uses an internal trust store is not
affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Users of FreeBSD Update should ensure that freebsd-update(8) is allowed to
create and delete files.  This is allowed by default.

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 14.2]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-14.2.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-14.2.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot-14.2.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 13.5]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-13.5.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-13.5.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot-13.5.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 13.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-13.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:08/caroot-13.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify caroot-13.4.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch -E < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use OpenSSL, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD

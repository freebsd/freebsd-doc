Topic:          icecast port contains remote vulnerability

Category:       ports
Module:         icecast
Announced:      2001-03-12
Credits:        |CyRaX| <cyrax@pkcrew.org>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-03-10
Vendor status:  Unresponsive
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

icecast is a server for streaming MP3 audio.

II.  Problem Description

The icecast software, versions prior to 1.3.7_1, contains multiple
format string vulnerabilities, which allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code as the user running icecast, usually the root
user.

There are a number of other potential abuses of format strings which
may or may not pose security risks, but have not currently been
audited.

The icecast port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains nearly 4700 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2
contain this problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Arbitrary remote users can execute arbitrary code on the local system
as the user running icecast, usually the root user.

If you have not chosen to install the icecast port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the icecast port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

Consider running the icecast software as a non-privileged user to
minimize the impact of further security vulnerabilities in this
software.

To upgrade icecast, choose one of the following options:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the icecast port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/audio/icecast-1.3.7_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/audio/icecast-1.3.7_1.tgz

NOTE: It may be several days before updated packages are available

[alpha]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/audio/icecast-1.3.7_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/audio/icecast-1.3.7_1.tgz

3) download a new port skeleton for the icecast port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

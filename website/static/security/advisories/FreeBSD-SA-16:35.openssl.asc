For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

The SSL alert protocol is a way to communicate problems within a SSL/TLS session.

II.  Problem Description

Due to improper handling of alert packets, OpenSSL would consume an excessive
amount of CPU time processing undefined alert messages.

III. Impact

A remote attacker who can initiate handshakes with an OpenSSL based server
can cause the server to consume a lot of computation power with very little
bandwidth usage, and may be able to use this technique in a leveraged Denial
of Service attack.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-9.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

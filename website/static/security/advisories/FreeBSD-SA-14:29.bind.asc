For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

II.  Problem Description

By causing queries to be made against a maliciously-constructed zone or
against a malicious DNS server, an attacker who is able to cause
specific queries to be sent to a nameserver can cause named(8) to
crash, leading to a denial of service.

All recursive BIND DNS servers are vulnerable to this.  Authoritative
servers are only vulnerable if the attacker is able to control a
delegation traversed by the authoritative server in order to serve
the zone.

III. Impact

An attacker who can cause specific queries to be sent to a nameserver
could cause named(8) to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but hosts not running named(8) are not
vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The bsnmpd is a simple and extensible SNMP daemon serves the Internet SNMP
(Simple Network Management Protocol).

II.  Problem Description

The bsnmpd(8) daemon is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow when it
has received a specifically crafted GETBULK PDU request.

III. Impact

This issue could be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of
the service daemon, or crash the service daemon, causing a denial-of-service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not running bsnmpd(8) are not
vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:01/bsnmpd.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:01/bsnmpd.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bsnmpd.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the bsnmpd(8) daemons, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

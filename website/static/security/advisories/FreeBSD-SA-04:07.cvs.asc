0.   Revision History

v1.0 2004-04-14  Initial release.
v1.1 2004-04-15  Added additional CVE name.  Corrected affected release
                 names.  Reworded `Workaround' section.

I.   Background

The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a version control system.  It
may be used to access a repository locally, or to access a `remote
repository' using a number of different methods.  When accessing a
remote repository, the target machine runs the CVS server to fulfill
client requests.

II.  Problem Description

Two programming errors were discovered in which path names handled by
CVS were not properly validated.  In one case, CAN-2004-0180, the CVS
client accepts absolute path names from the server when determining
which files to update.  In another case, CAN-2004-0405, the CVS server
accepts relative path names from the client when determining which
files to transmit, including those containing references to parent
directories (`../').

III. Impact

These programming errors generally only have a security impact when
dealing with remote CVS repositories.

A malicious CVS server may cause a CVS client to overwrite arbitrary
files on the client's system.

A CVS client may request RCS files from a remote system other than
those in the repository specified by $CVSROOT.  These RCS files need
not be part of any CVS repository themselves.

IV.  Workaround

Users of CVS clients should avoid accessing remote repositories.
Administrators of CVS repositories should disable remote access.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE; or to the RELENG_5_2,
RELENG_4_9, or RELENG_4_8 security branch dated after the correction
date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.8,
4.9, 5.1, and 5.2 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:07/cvs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:07/cvs.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

Topic:          security issue in SETI@home client
Announced:      2003-04-08

I.   Introduction

A port in the FreeBSD Ports Collection is affected by a security
issue.  Summary information is given below with references and
affected versions.  All versions given refer to the FreeBSD
port/package version numbers.  The listed vulnerabilities are not
specific to FreeBSD unless otherwise noted.

This port is not installed by default, nor is it ``part of FreeBSD''
as such.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection contains thousands of
third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  FreeBSD makes
no claim about the security of these third-party applications.  See
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/ports/> for more information about the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

II.  Ports

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Port name:      astro/setiathome
Affected:       All versions
Status:         Not fixed

Excerpt from Berend-Jan Wever a.k.a. SkyLined's advisory:
``There is a bufferoverflow in the server responds handler. Sending
an overly large string followed by a newline ('\n') character to the
client will trigger this overflow. This has been tested with various
versions of the client. All versions are presumed to have this flaw in
some form.''
Example exploits for FreeBSD and other systems exist.
A new version of SETI@home for FreeBSD is not available at the time
of this security notice.

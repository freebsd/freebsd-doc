Topic:          BIND remote denial of service vulnerability

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

II.  Problem Description

An error in the handling of TKEY queries can be exploited by an attacker
for use as a denial-of-service vector, as a constructed packet can use
the defect to trigger a REQUIRE assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.

III. Impact

A remote attacker can trigger a crash of a name server.  Both recursive and
authoritative servers are affected, and the exposure can not be mitigated
by either ACLs or configuration options limiting or denying service because
the exploitable code occurs early in the packet handling, before checks
enforcing those boundaries.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that are not running BIND are not
vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

The named service has to be restarted after the update.  A reboot is
recommended but not required.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

The named service has to be restarted after the update.  A reboot is
recommended but not required.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:17/bind.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:17/bind.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bind.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

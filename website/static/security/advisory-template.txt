V.   Solution

<XX insert solution here>

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
[XX Needs reboot? Mention please]

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system installed from base system packages:

Systems running a 15.0-RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64
platforms, which were installed using base system packages, can be updated
via the pkg(8) utility:

# pkg upgrade -r FreeBSD-base
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update" <XX if required>

2) To update your vulnerable system installed from binary distribution sets:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, which were not installed using base
system packages, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update" <XX if required>

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD XX]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-XX:XX/XXXX.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-XX:XX/XXXX.patch.asc
# gpg --verify XXXX.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

<XX for a userland utility:>

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

<XX for a daemons>

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

<XX for a common library>

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

<XX for a kernel vulnerability:>

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

The kernel I/O structure will be described showing how I/O is multiplexed, special devices are handled, character processing is performed, and the buffer pool is managed. The implementation of the filesystem and its capabilities, including soft updates and snapshots, will be described. The filesystem interface will then be described to show how it can be used to support multiple filesystem types such as Sun Microsystem's Network File System (NFS). The course will also cover the FreeBSD socket-based network architecture, layering, and implementation. Socket communications primitives and internal layering will be discussed, with emphasis on the interfaces between layers; the TCP/IP implementation will be used as an example. A discussion of routing issues will be included. Other system-related topics include performance measurement, system tuning, and security issues. The presentations will emphasize code organization, data structure navigation, and algorithms. It will not cover machine-specific parts of the system, such as device drivers. Saturdays September 29, October 6 and 27, and November 3, 2007; 9:00AM to 5:30PM Sept. 29 to Nov. 3: Sat., 9 am-5:30 pm (no meetings Oct. 13 and Oct. 20)."

description = "The BSD community started at UC Berkeley in the late 1970's. Through the 1980's, the BSD software was developed and released from Berkeley. In 1992, Berkeley made its final release, 4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source version of BSD. Since that time, independent development has continued by the FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly projects. This talk traces the history and structure of the BSD community from its start as a small group of paid staff at Berkeley up through the thousands of volunteer developers that make up the FreeBSD Project of today. It describes how the development structure set up at Berkeley was expanded to create a self-organizing project that supports an ever growing and changing group of developers around the world."

Just like the spirit of COSCUP, in this conference, you can be both attendee and promoter, and also involve the operation of the conference. The major topics in COSCUP 2007 including web-based platform and embedded system due to the popularity of Web 2.0 and OLPC; the Chinese session, Lightning Talk and System session are the most interesting topics for years. There will be some presentations and talks about FreeBSD. The program is attractive just like before, we invite not only big ones in the community but also developers of non-famous local OSS projects, to get more people involved and make OSS more brilliant in Taiwan."

EuroBSDcon is also a boiler plate for ideas, discussions and information exchange, which often turn into programming projects. The conference has always attracted active programmers, administrators and aspiring students, as well as IT companies at large, which found the conference a convenient and quality training option for its staff. We firmly believe that high profile education is vital to the future of technology, and hence greatly welcome students and young people to this regular meeting."

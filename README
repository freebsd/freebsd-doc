If you plan on building a local copy of the FreeBSD documentation, or using
our toolchain in your own projects, please read

    http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/

for information about the tools and formatting languages we use.  Chapter
2 covers the software and related items you will need to install.

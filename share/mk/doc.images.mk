#
# This include file <doc.images.mk> handles image processing.
#
# There are two types of images that must be handled:
#
#  1.  Images from the library directory, that are shared across multiple
#      documents.
#
#  2.  Images that are document specific.
#
# For library images this file ensures that they are copied in to the
# documents directory so that they can be reference properly.
#
# For library images *and* document specific images, this file ensures
# that the images are converted from their repository format to the
# correct output format.
#

#
# Using document specific images
# ------------------------------
#
# The images that each document provides *from the repository* are listed in
# the IMAGES variable.
#
# We then need to build a list of images that must be generated from these.
# This is to handle the case where a document might include some images as
# bitmaps and some as vector images in the repository, but where, depending
# on the output format, you want all the images in one format or another.
#
# This list of generated images can then be cleaned in the clean target
# later
#
# This is the same for each format.  To use IMAGES_GEN_PNG as an example,
# the substitution means "First match, using M, all the components of
# ${IMAGES} that match the '*.eps' regexp.  Then, search/replace the .eps
# in the matching filenames with .png.  Finally, stick the results in the
# ${IMAGES_GEN_PNG} variable."  ${IMAGES_GEN_PNG} then contains the names
# of all the .eps images listed, but with a .png extension.  This is the
# list of files we need to generate if we need PNG format images.
#
# The PDF generation, when it's looking for file 'foo', will first try
# foo.pdf, and it will try foo.png.  There's no point converting PNG files
# to PDF, as they'll be used directly.  However, we can convert the EPS files
# to PDF, and hopefully get better quality.

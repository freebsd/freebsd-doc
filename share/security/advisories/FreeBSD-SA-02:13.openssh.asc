CVE:            CAN-2002-0083
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

OpenSSH is a free version of the SSH protocol suite of network
connectivity tools.  OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including
passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection
hijacking, and other network-level attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH
provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well as a
variety of authentication methods. `ssh' is the client application,
while `sshd' is the server.

II.  Problem Description

OpenSSH multiplexes `channels' over a single TCP connection in order
to implement X11, TCP, and agent forwarding.  An off-by-one error in
the code which manages channels can result in a reference to memory
beyond that allocated for channels.  A malicious client or server may
be able to influence the contents of the memory so referenced.

III. Impact

An authorized remote user (i.e. a user that can successfully
authenticate on the target system) may be able to cause sshd to
execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges.

A malicious server may be able to cause a connecting ssh client to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the client user.

IV.  Workaround

Do one of the following:

1) The FreeBSD malloc implementation can be configured to overwrite
   or `junk' memory that is returned to the malloc arena.  Due to the
   details of exploiting this bug, configuring malloc to junk memory
   will thwart the attack.

   To configure a FreeBSD system to junk memory, execute the following
   commands as root:

   # ln -fs J /etc/malloc.conf

   Note that this option will degrade system performance.  See the
   malloc(3) man page for full details on malloc options.

2) Disable the base system sshd by executing the following command as
   root:

   # kill `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`

   Be sure that sshd is not restarted when the system is restarted
   by adding the following line to the end of /etc/rc.conf:

   sshd_enable="NO"

   AND

   Deinstall the openssh or openssh-portable ports if you have one of
   them installed.

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

[For OpenSSH included in the base system]

1) Upgrade the vulnerable system to 4.4-RELEASEp9, 4.5-RELEASEp2,
   or 4.5-STABLE after the correction date and rebuild.

2) FreeBSD 4.x systems prior to the correction date:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE,
4.5-RELEASE, and 4.5-STABLE dated prior to the correction date.  It
may or may not apply to older, unsupported versions of FreeBSD.

Download the patch and the detached PGP signature from the following
locations, and verify the signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:13/openssh.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:13/openssh.patch.asc

Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/sshd.patch
# cd /usr/src/secure/lib/libssh
# make depend && make all
# cd /usr/src/secure/usr.sbin/sshd
# make depend && make all install
# cd /usr/src/secure/usr.bin/ssh
# make depend && make all install

[For the OpenSSH ports]

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the OpenSSH port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package obtained from
the following directory:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/security/

[other platforms]
Packages are not automatically generated for other platforms at this
time due to lack of build resources.

3) Download a new port skeleton for the openssh or openssh-portable
port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/Latest/portcheckout.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/Latest/portcheckout.tgz

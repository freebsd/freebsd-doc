Topic:          Buffer overflow in lpd

Category:       core

=============================================================================

I.   Background    

     The lpd program is used to print local and remote print jobs.  It
     is standard software in the FreeBSD operating system.

II.  Problem Description

     The lpd program runs as root.  A remote attacker can exploit a
     buffer overflow to obtain root privs.

III. Impact
     
     Remote users can gain root privs.

IV.  Workaround

     The only workaround is to disable lpd, which will have the effect
     of removing the printing functionality from the system.  Since
     the buffer overflow happens before the connection is authenticated,
     using lpd's authentication methods will not affect the system
     vulnerability.

V.   Solution

     Apply the following patch, rebuild and install libc:

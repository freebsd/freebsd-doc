                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Incorrectly defined unicode character(s)

Category:       core
Module:         localedef
Announced:      2016-12-06
Credits:        
Affects:        FreeBSD 11.0
Corrected:      2016-11-05 09:46:48 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
                2016-12-06 00:09:52 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p4)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The localedef(1) utility converts source definitions for locale categories
into a format usable by the functions and utilities whose operational
behavior is determined by the setting of the locale environment variables.

II.  Problem Description

When compiling character class definitions, localedef(1) may incorrectly
coalesce non-consecutive ranges, so that unused codepoints located in a
gap between two ranges of characters belonging to a same class will be
included in that class.

III. Impact

Some Unicode codepoints that are reserved for later use may be reported as
valid by the ctype(3) / wctype(3) functions.  Incorrect classification may
result in input validation errors.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart all daemons that are running with unicode locale, or reboot the
system.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-16:21/localedef.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-16:21/localedef.patch.asc
# gpg --verify localedef.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Note that rebuilding the localedef(1) utility only isn't enough to
fix already installed locales on your system.

Restart all daemons that are running with unicode locale, or reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          NIS master updates are not pushed to NIS slave

Category:       core
Module:         yppush, ypxfr
Announced:      2017-02-23
Credits:        Mark Johnston
Affects:        FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE
Corrected:      2016-10-19 17:18:48 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
                2017-02-23 07:11:48 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p8)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

yppush(8) and ypxfr(8) utilities are used to synchronize databases from
a master NIS server.

II.  Problem Description

A bug present in FreeBSD 11.0 prevents these utilities from working
properly. In particular, an attempt to synchronize a non-empty map
causes yppush(8) to crash.

III. Impact

The problem prevents updates to a master NIS server from being propagated
to NIS slave servers.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but NIS configurations which do not make
use of NIS slave servers are unaffected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

A reboot is not required.  However, the system administrator may need to
manually run yppush(8) after the update have been applied on slave systems.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:02/yp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:02/yp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify yp.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

A reboot is not required.  However, the system administrator may need to
manually run yppush(8) after the update have been applied on slave systems.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

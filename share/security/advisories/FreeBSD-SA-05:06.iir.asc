0.   Revision History

v1.0 2005-05-06  Initial release.
v1.1 2005-05-07  Updated credits to include Andre Guibert de Bruet, who
                 was inadvertantly omitted from the original advisory.

I.   Background

The iir(4) driver provides support for the Intel Integrated RAID
controllers and ICP Vortex RAID controllers.

II.  Problem Description

The default permissions on the /dev/iir device node allow unprivileged
local users to open the device and execute ioctl calls.

III. Impact

Unprivileged local users can send commands to the hardware supported by
the iir(4) driver, allowing destruction of data and possible disclosure
of data.

IV.  Workaround

Systems without hardware supported by the iir(4) driver are not affected
by this issue.  On systems which are affected, as a workaround, the
permissions on /dev/iir can be changed manually.

As root, execute the following command:

# chmod 0600 /dev/iir*

On 5.x, the following commands are also needed to ensure that the
correct permissions are used after rebooting.

# echo 'perm iir* 0600' >> /etc/devfs.conf
# echo 'devfs_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

If the administrator has created additional device nodes, or mounted
additional instances of devfs(5) elsewhere in the file system name
space, attention should be paid to ensure that either the iir device
node is not visible in those name spaces, or is similarly protected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE or 5-STABLE, or to the
RELENG_5_3, RELENG_4_11, or RELENG_4_10 security branch dated after
the correction date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.10,
4.11, and 5.3 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-05:06/iir.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-05:06/iir.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

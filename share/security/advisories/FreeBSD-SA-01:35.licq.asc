Topic:          licq contains multiple remote vulnerabilities

Category:       ports
Module:         licq
Announced:      2001-04-23
Credits:        Stan Bubrouski <stan@ccs.neu.edu>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-03-13
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

licq is an ICQ client.

II.  Problem Description

The licq port, versions prior to 1.0.3, contains a vulnerability in
URL parsing.  URLs received by the licq program are passed to the
web browser using the system() function.  Since licq performs no
sanity checking, a remote attacker may be able to pipe commands
contained in the URL causing the client to execute arbitrary
commands.  Additionally, the licq program also contains a buffer
overflow in the logging functions allowing a remote attacker to
cause licq to crash and potentially execute arbitbrary code on the
local machine as the user running licq.

The licq port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
over 5000 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  The
ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this
problem since it was discovered after the releases.  The ports
collection that shipped with FreeBSD 4.3 is not vulnerable since this
problem was corrected prior to the release.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Remote attackers may be able to crash licq or execute arbitrary
commands on the local machine as the user running the licq program.

If you have not chosen to install the licq port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the licq port/package if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the licq port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/net/licq-1.0.3.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/net/licq-1.0.3.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the licq port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

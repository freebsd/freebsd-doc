                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          gaim remote vulnerability

Category:       ports
Module:         gaim
Announced:      2000-11-20
Credits:        Stan Bubrouski <stan@CCS.NEU.EDU>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2000-11-16
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

gaim is a popular AOL Instant Messenger client.

II.  Problem Description

The gaim port, versions prior to 0.10.3_1, allows a client-side
exploit through a buffer overflow in the HTML parsing code.  This
vulnerability may allow remote users to execute arbitrary code as the
user running gaim.

The gaim port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
over 4100 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  The
ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.1.1 contain this
problem since it was discovered after the releases, but it was
corrected prior to the release of FreeBSD 4.2.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may execute arbitrary code as the user running
gaim.

If you have not chosen to install the gaim port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the gaim port/package, if you you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the gaim port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/net/gaim-0.10.3_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/net/gaim-0.10.3_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/net/gaim-0.10.3_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/net/gaim-0.10.3_1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/net/gaim-0.10.3_1.tgz

NOTE: It may be several days before updated packages are available.

3) download a new port skeleton for the gaim port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

FreeBSD-SN-03:01                                              Security Notice
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          security issue in samba ports
Announced:      2003-04-07

I.   Introduction

Several ports in the FreeBSD Ports Collection are affected by security
issues.  These are listed below with references and affected versions.
All versions given refer to the FreeBSD port/package version numbers.
The listed vulnerabilities are not specific to FreeBSD unless
otherwise noted.

These ports are not installed by default, nor are they ``part of
FreeBSD'' as such.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection contains thousands of
third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  FreeBSD makes
no claim about the security of these third-party applications.  See
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/ports/> for more information about the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

II.  Ports

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Port name:      net/samba
Affected:       versions < samba-2.2.8_2, samba-2.2.8a
Status:         Fixed

Two vulnerabilities recently:

(1) Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team identified
vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution as root,
as well as a race condition that could allow overwriting of system
files.  (This vulnerability was previously fixed in Samba 2.2.8.)

(2) Digital Defense, Inc. reports: ``This vulnerability, if exploited
correctly, leads to an anonymous user gaining root access on a Samba
serving system. All versions of Samba up to and including Samba 2.2.8
are vulnerable. Alpha versions of Samba 3.0 and above are *NOT*
vulnerable.''

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Port name:      net/samba-tng
Affected:       all versions
Status:         Not fixed

Some or all of the vulnerabilities affecting Samba may also affect
Samba-TNG.  No confirmation or official patches are available at the
time of this security notice.

III. Upgrading Ports/Packages

To upgrade a fixed port/package, perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your Ports Collection and rebuild and reinstall the port.
Several tools are available in the Ports Collection to make this
easier.  See:
  /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout
  /usr/ports/misc/porteasy
  /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package obtained from

[FreeBSD 4.x, i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/All/

[FreeBSD 5.x, i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/All/

Packages are not automatically generated for other architectures at
this time.

Note that new, official packages may not be available on all mirrors
immediately.  In the interim, Security Officer-generated packages (and
detached digital signatures) are available for the i386 architecture
at:

[FreeBSD 4.x, i386]
ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/security-officer/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/samba-2.2.8_2.tgz
ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/security-officer/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/samba-2.2.8_2.tgz.asc

[FreeBSD 5.x]
ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/security-officer/ports/i386/packages-5-current/samba-2.2.8_2.tbz
ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/security-officer/ports/i386/packages-5-current/samba-2.2.8_2.tbz.asc

FreeBSD Security Notices are communications from the Security Officer
intended to inform the user community about potential security issues,
such as bugs in the third-party applications found in the Ports
Collection, which will not be addressed in a FreeBSD Security
Advisory.

                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          oops allows remote code execution

Category:       ports
Module:         oops
Announced:      2000-12-20
Credits:        |CyRaX| <cyrax@pkcrew.org>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2000-12-14
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

oops is a caching WWW proxy server.

II.  Problem Description

The oops port, versions prior to 1.5.2, contains remote
vulnerabilities through buffer and stack overflows in the HTML parsing
code.  These vulnerabilities may allow remote users to execute
arbitrary code as the user running oops.

The oops port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains over
4200 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  The ports
collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this problem
since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may execute arbitrary code as the user running
oops.

If you have not chosen to install the oops port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the oops port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the oops port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/www/oops-1.5.2.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/www/oops-1.5.2.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/www/oops-1.5.2.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/www/oops-1.5.2.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/www/oops-1.5.2.tgz

NOTE: It may be several days before updated packages are available.

3) download a new port skeleton for the oops port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

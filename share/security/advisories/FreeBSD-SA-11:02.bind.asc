For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides data integrity, origin
authentication and authenticated denial of existence to resolvers.

II.  Problem Description

Very large RRSIG RRsets included in a negative response can trigger
an assertion failure that will crash named(8) due to an off-by-one error
in a buffer size check.

III. Impact

If named(8) is being used as a recursive resolver, an attacker who
controls a DNS zone being resolved can cause named(8) to crash,
resulting in a denial of (DNS resolving) service.

DNSSEC does not need to be enabled on the resolver for it to be
vulnerable.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not running the BIND DNS server
or using it exclusively as an authoritative name server (i.e., not as a
caching resolver) are not vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE,
or to the RELENG_8_2, RELENG_8_1, RELENG_7_4, or RELENG_7_3
security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD
7.3, 7.4, 8.1 and 8.2 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:02/bind.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:02/bind.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# /etc/rc.d/named restart

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running 7.3-RELEASE, 7.4-RELEASE, 8.1-RELEASE, or 8.2-RELEASE
on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Topic:          cfengine port contains remote root vulnerability

Category:       ports
Module:         cfengine
Announced:      2001-03-12
Credits:        Pekka Savola <pekkas@NETCORE.FI>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-01-21
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

cfengine is a system for automating the configuration and maintenance
of large networks.

II.  Problem Description

The cfengine port, versions prior to 1.6.1, contained several format
string vulnerabilities which allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the local system as the user running cfengine,
usually user root.

The cfengine port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains nearly 4700 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2
contain this problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Arbitrary remote users can execute code on the local system as the
user running cfengine, usually user root.

If you have not chosen to install the cfengine port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

One of the following:

1) Deinstall the cfengine port/package, if you have installed it.

2) Implement access controls on connections to the cfengine server,
either at the application level using the cfengine configuration file,
or by using network-level packet filtering on the local system using
ipfw(8)/ipf(8), or on the perimeter firewalls.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the cfengine port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/sysutils/cfengine-1.6.3.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/sysutils/cfengine-1.6.3.tar.gz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the cfengine port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

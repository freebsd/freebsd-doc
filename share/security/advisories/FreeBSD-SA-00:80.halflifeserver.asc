Topic:          halflifeserver allows remote code execution

Category:       ports
Module:         halflifeserver
Announced:      2000-12-20
Credits:        Mark Cooper
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2000-11-29
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

halflifeserver is a dedicated server for hosting Half-Life games.

II.  Problem Description

The halflifeserver port, versions prior to 3.1.0.4, contains local and
remote vulnerabilities through buffer overflows and format string
vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities may allow remote users to
execute arbitrary code as the user running halflifeserver.

The halflifeserver port is not installed by default, nor is it "part
of FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 4200 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2
contain this problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may execute arbitrary code as the user running
the halflifeserver software.

If you have not chosen to install the halflifeserver port/package,
then your system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the halflifeserver port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the halflifeserver
port.

2) download a new port skeleton for the halflifeserver port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port. Due to license restrictions no binary
package is provided for the halflifeserver port.

3) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (2) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

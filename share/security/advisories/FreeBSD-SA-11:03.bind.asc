date of this advisory.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

II.  Problem Description

A logic error in the BIND code causes the BIND daemon to accept bogus
data, which could cause the daemon to crash.

III. Impact

An attacker able to send traffic to the BIND daemon can cause it to
crash, resulting in a denial of service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not running the BIND name server
are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to 8-STABLE dated after the correction
date.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

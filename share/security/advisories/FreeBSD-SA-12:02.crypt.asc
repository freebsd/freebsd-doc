CVE Name:       CVE-2012-2143

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The crypt(3) function performs password hashing with additional code added
to deter key search attempts.

II.  Problem Description

There is a programming error in the DES implementation used in crypt()
when handling input which contains characters that can not be represented
with 7-bit ASCII.

III. Impact

When the input contains characters with only the most significant bit set
(0x80), that character and all characters after it will be ignored.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not using crypt(), or which only
use it to handle 7-bit ASCII are not vulnerable.  Note that, because
DES does not have the computational complexity to defeat brute force
search on modern computers, it is not recommended for new applications.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE, 8-STABLE, or 9-STABLE,
or to the RELENG_7_4, RELENG_8_3, RELENG_8_2, RELENG_8_1, or RELENG_9_0
security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.4,
8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 9.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:02/crypt.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:02/crypt.patch.asc

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libcrypt
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

NOTE: On the amd64 platform, the above procedure will not update the
lib32 (i386 compatibility) libraries.  On amd64 systems where the i386
compatibility libraries are used, the operating system should instead
be recompiled as described in
<URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running 7.4-RELEASE, 8.3-RELEASE, 8.2-RELEASE, 8.1-RELEASE,
or 9.0-RELEASE on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

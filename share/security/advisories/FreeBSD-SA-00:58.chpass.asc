Topic:          chpass family contains local root vulnerability

Category:       core
Module:         chfn/chpass/chsh/ypchfn/ypchpass/ypchsh/passwd
Announced:      2000-10-30
Credits:	Problem fixed during internal auditing.
		Vulnerability pointed out by: caddis <caddis@DISSENSION.NET>
Affects:        FreeBSD 3.x (all releases), FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE,
		FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE prior to the correction date
Corrected:      2000/07/20 (FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE)
		2000/10/04 (FreeBSD 3.5.1-STABLE)
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

ch{fn,pass,sh} are utilities for changing user "finger" information,
passwords, and login shell, respectively. The yp* variants perform the
analogous changes on a NIS account.

II.  Problem Description

A "format string vulnerability" was discovered in code used by the
vipw utility during an internal FreeBSD code audit in July 2000. The
vipw utility does not run with increased privileges and so it was
believed at the time that it did not represent a security
vulnerability. However it was not realised that this code is also
shared with other utilities -- namely chfn, chpass, chsh, ypchfn,
ypchpass, ypchsh and passwd -- which do in fact run setuid root.

Therefore, the problem may be exploited by unprivileged local users to
gain root access to the local machine.

All versions of FreeBSD prior to the correction date including 4.0 and
3.5.1 are vulnerable to this problem, but it was fixed in the 4.x
branch prior to the release of FreeBSD 4.1.

III. Impact

Local users can obtain root privileges on the local machine.

IV.  Workaround

Remove the setuid bit on the following utilities. This has the
side-effect that non-root users cannot change their finger
information, passwords, or login shells.

# chflags noschg /usr/bin/chfn /usr/bin/chpass /usr/bin/chsh
# chmod u-s /usr/bin/chfn /usr/bin/chpass /usr/bin/chsh
# chflags noschg /usr/bin/ypchfn /usr/bin/ypchpass /usr/bin/ypchsh
# chmod u-s /usr/bin/ypchfn /usr/bin/ypchpass /usr/bin/ypchsh
# chflags noschg /usr/bin/passwd
# chmod u-s /usr/bin/passwd

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable FreeBSD system to 4.1-RELEASE,
4.1.1-RELEASE, 4.1.1-STABLE or 3.5.1-STABLE after the respective
correction dates.

2) Apply the patch below and recompile the respective files:

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides data integrity, origin
authentication and authenticated denial of existence to resolvers.

II.  Problem Description

BIND 9 stores a cache of query names that are known to be failing due
to misconfigured name servers or a broken chain of trust.  Under high
query loads, when DNSSEC validation is active, it is possible for a
condition to arise in which data from this cache of failing queries
could be used before it was fully initialized, triggering an assertion
failure.

III. Impact

A remote attacker that is able to generate high volume of DNSSEC
validation enabled queries can trigger the assertion failure that causes
it to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not running the BIND resolving
name server with dnssec-validation enabled are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE, 8-STABLE, or 9-STABLE,
or to the RELENG_7_4, RELENG_8_3, RELENG_8_2, RELENG_8_1, or RELENG_9_0
security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.4,
8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 9.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:05/bind.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:05/bind.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind/dns
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running 7.4-RELEASE, 8.3-RELEASE, 8.2-RELEASE, 8.1-RELEASE,
or 9.0-RELEASE on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

4) Install and run BIND from the Ports Collection after the correction
date.  The following versions and newer versions of BIND installed from
the Ports Collection are not affected by this vulnerability:

        bind96-9.6.3.1.ESV.R7.2
        bind97-9.7.6.2
        bind98-9.8.3.2
        bind99-9.9.1.2

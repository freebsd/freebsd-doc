For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

The Heartbeat Extension provides a new protocol for TLS/DTLS allowing the
usage of keep-alive functionality without performing a renegotiation and a
basis for path MTU (PMTU) discovery for DTLS.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a variant of the
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
OpenSSL uses the Montgomery Ladder Approach to compute scalar multiplication
in a fixed amount of time, which does not leak any information through timing
or power.

II.  Problem Description

The code used to handle the Heartbeat Extension does not do sufficient boundary
checks on record length, which allows reading beyond the actual payload.
[CVE-2014-0160].  Affects FreeBSD 10.0 only.

A flaw in the implementation of Montgomery Ladder Approach would create a
side-channel that leaks sensitive timing information. [CVE-2014-0076]

III. Impact

An attacker who can send a specifically crafted packet to TLS server or client
with an established connection can reveal up to 64k of memory of the remote
system.  Such memory might contain sensitive information, including key
material, protected content, etc. which could be directly useful, or might
be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges.  [CVE-2014-0160]

A local attacker might be able to snoop a signing process and might recover
the signing key from it.  [CVE-2014-0076]

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that do not use OpenSSL to implement
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
protocols implementation and do not use the ECDSA implementation from OpenSSL
are not vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 8.x and FreeBSD 9.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:06/openssl.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:06/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:06/openssl-10.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:06/openssl-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.patch.asc

Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

IMPORTANT: the update procedure above does not update OpenSSL from the
Ports Collection or from a package, known as security/openssl, which
has to be updated separately via ports or package.  Users who have
installed security/openssl should update to at least version 1.0.1_10.

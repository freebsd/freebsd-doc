For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its
file systems so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount
them as if they were on local disks.  FreeBSD includes server and client
implementations of NFS.

II.  Problem Description

The NFS client subsystem fails to correctly validate the length of a
parameter provided by the user when a filesystem is mounted.

III. Impact

A user who can mount filesystems can execute arbitrary code in the kernel.
On systems where the non-default vfs.usermount feature has been enabled,
unprivileged users may be able to gain superuser ("root") privileges.

IV.  Workaround

Do not allow untrusted users to mount filesystems.  To prevent unprivileged
users from mounting filesystems, set the vfs.usermount sysctl variable to
zero:

# sysctl vfs.usermount=0

Note that the default value of this variable is zero, i.e., FreeBSD is not
affected by this vulnerability in its default configuration, and FreeBSD
system administrators are strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

V.   Solution

NOTE WELL: Even with this fix allowing users to mount arbitrary media
should not be considered safe.  Most of the file systems in FreeBSD were
not built to protect safeguard against malicious devices.  While such bugs
in file systems are fixed when found, a complete audit has not been
perfomed on the file system code.

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE, or to the
RELENG_8_0, RELENG_7_3, or RELENG_7_2 security branch dated after the
correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.2, 7.3
and 8.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-10:06/nfsclient.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-10:06/nfsclient.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running 7.2-RELEASE, 7.3-RELEASE, or 8.0-RELEASE on the i386 or
amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

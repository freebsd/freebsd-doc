                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          micq remote buffer overflow vulnerability

Category:       ports
Module:         micq
Announced:      2001-01-29
Credits:        recidjvo@pkcrew.org
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-01-24
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

micq is a text-based ICQ client.

II.  Problem Description

The micq port, versions prior to 0.4.6.1, contains a remote
vulnerability: due to a buffer overflow, a malicious remote user
sending specially-crafted packets may be able to execute arbitrary
code on the local system with the privileges of the micq process.  To
accomplish this, the attacker must be able to sniff the packets
between the micq client and ICQ server in order to gain the session
key to cause the client to accept the malicious packets.

The micq port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of FreeBSD"
as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains
over 4500 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  The
ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2 contain this
problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may cause arbitrary code to be executed
with the privileges of the micq process.

If you have not chosen to install the micq port/package, then
your system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the micq port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the micq port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/net/micq-0.4.6.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/net/micq-0.4.6.1.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/net/micq-0.4.6.1.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the micq port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

I.   Background

The inetd ident server is an implementation of the RFC1413
identification server which returns the local username of the
user connecting to a remote service.

II.  Problem Description

During internal auditing, the internal ident server in inetd was found
to incorrectly set group privileges according to the user.  Due to
ident using root's group permissions, users may read the first 16
(excluding initial whitespace) bytes of wheel-accessible files.

All released versions of FreeBSD prior to the correction date
including FreeBSD 3.5.1 and FreeBSD 4.2 are vulnerable.

III. Impact

Users can read the first 16 bytes of wheel-accessible files.

To determine which may be potentially read, execute the following
command as root:

# find / -group wheel \( -perm -40 -a \! -perm +4 \) -ls

The inetd internal ident server is not enabled by default.  If you
have not enabled the ident portion of inetd, you are not vulnerable.

IV.  Workaround

Disable the internal ident server, if enabled: comment out all lines
beginning with "auth" in /etc/inetd.conf, then restart inetd by
sending it a SIGHUP:

# killall -HUP inetd

V.   Solution

One of the following:

Upgrade the vulnerable FreeBSD system to 3.5-STABLE or 4.2-STABLE
after the correction date.

To patch your present system: download the relevant patch from the
below location, and execute the following commands as root:

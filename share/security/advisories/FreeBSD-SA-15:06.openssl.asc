For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and notation that
describes rules and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting,
and decoding data in telecommunications and computer networking, which
enables representation of objects that are independent of machine-specific
encoding technique.

II.  Problem Description

A malformed elliptic curve private key file could cause a use-after-free
condition in the d2i_ECPrivateKey function.  [CVE-2015-0209]

An attempt to compare ASN.1 boolean types will cause the ASN1_TYPE_cmp
function to crash with an invalid read.  [CVE-2015-0286]

Reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing may allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption via an invalid write. [CVE-2015-0287]

The function X509_to_X509_REQ will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if
the certificate key is invalid.  [CVE-2015-0288]

The PKCS#7 parsing code does not handle missing outer ContentInfo correctly.
[CVE-2015-0289]

A malicious client can trigger an OPENSSL_assert in servers that both support
SSLv2 and enable export cipher suites by sending a specially crafted SSLv2
CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message.  [CVE-2015-0293]

III. Impact

A malformed elliptic curve private key file can cause server daemons using
OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.  [CVE-2015-0209]

A remote attacker who is able to send specifically crafted certificates
may be able to crash an OpenSSL client or server.  [CVE-2015-0286]

An attacker who can cause invalid writes with applications that parse
structures containing CHOICE or ANY DEFINED BY components and reusing
the structures may be able to cause them to crash.  Such reuse is believed
to be rare.  OpenSSL clients and servers are not affected. [CVE-2015-0287]

An attacker may be able to crash applications that create a new certificate
request with subject name the same as in an existing, specifically crafted
certificate.  This usage is rare in practice.  [CVE-2015-0288]

An attacker may be able to crash applications that verify PKCS#7 signatures,
decrypt PKCS#7 data or otherwise parse PKCS#7 structures with specifically
crafted certificates.  [CVE-2015-0289]

A malicious client can trigger an OPENSSL_assert in servers that both support
SSLv2 and enable export cipher suites by sending a carefully crafted SSLv2
CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, resulting in a Denial of Service.  [CVE-2015-0293]

Note that two issues in the original OpenSSL advisory, CVE-2015-0204 and
CVE-2015-0292, were already addressed by FreeBSD-SA-15:01.openssl and
FreeBSD-EN-15:02.openssl.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 8.4 and FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:06/openssl-0.9.8.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:06/openssl-0.9.8.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-0.9.8.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 10.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:06/openssl-1.0.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-15:06/openssl-1.0.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-1.0.1.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.

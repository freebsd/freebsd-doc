For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/security/>.

0.   Revision History

v1.0  2004-11-18  Initial release.
v1.1  2004-11-20  Added missing CVE name; removed empty references section.

I.   Background

The fetch(1) utility is a tool for fetching files via FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.

II.  Problem Description

An integer overflow condition in the processing of HTTP headers can result
in a buffer overflow.

III. Impact

A malicious server or CGI script can respond to an HTTP or HTTPS request in
such a manner as to cause arbitrary portions of the client's memory to be
overwritten, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

IV.  Workaround

There is no known workaround for the affected application, although
the ftp(1) application in the FreeBSD base system, and several 
applications in the FreeBSD Ports collection provide similar 
functionality and could be used in place of fetch(1).

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE or 5-STABLE, or to the
RELENG_5_3, RELENG_5_2, RELENG_4_10, or RELENG_4_8 security branch dated
after the correction date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.8, 4.10,
5.2, and 5.3 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# ftp ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:16/fetch.patch
# ftp ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:16/fetch.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/fetch
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

3) IMPORTANT NOTE to users of FreeBSD Update:

FreeBSD Update (security/freebsd-update in the FreeBSD Ports collection)
is a binary security update system for the FreeBSD base system.  It is 
not supported or endorsed by the FreeBSD Security team, but its author
has requested that the following note be included in this advisory:

  FreeBSD Update uses the fetch(1) utility for downloading security
  updates to the FreeBSD base system.  While these updates are 
  cryptographically signed, and FreeBSD Update is therefore immune from
  most attacks, it is exposed to this vulnerability since the files
  must be fetched before their integrity can be verified.

  As a workaround, FreeBSD Update can be made to use the ftp(1) utility
  for downloading updates as follows:

  # sed -i.bak -e 's/fetch -qo/ftp -o/' /usr/local/sbin/freebsd-update
  # freebsd-update fetch
  # mv /usr/local/sbin/freebsd-update.bak /usr/local/sbin/freebsd-update
  # freebsd-update install

corrected in FreeBSD.

                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          tinyproxy contains remote vulnerabilities

Category:       ports
Module:         tinyproxy
Announced:      2001-01-29
Credits:        |CyRaX| <cyrax@pkcrew.org>
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date.
Corrected:      2001-01-22
Vendor status:  Updated version released
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

tinyproxy is a lightweight http proxy.

II.  Problem Description

The tinyproxy port, versions prior to 1.3.3a, contains remote
vulnerabilities: due to a heap overflow, malicious remote users can
cause a denial-of-service by crashing the proxy.  Additionally, the
attacker may potentially cause arbitrary code to be executed as the
user running tinyproxy.

The tinyproxy port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 4500 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format.  The ports collections shipped with FreeBSD 3.5.1 and 4.2
contain this problem since it was discovered after the releases.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

Malicious remote users may cause a denial-of-service and potentially
cause arbitrary code to be executed.

If you have not chosen to install the tinyproxy port/package, then
your system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the tinyproxy port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the tinyproxy port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/www/tinyproxy-1.3.3a.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/www/tinyproxy-1.3.3a.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/www/tinyproxy-1.3.3a.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources.

3) download a new port skeleton for the tinyproxy port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

Topic:          pf(4) housekeeping thread causes kernel panic

Category:       core
Module:         pf
Announced:      2017-08-10
Credits:        Kristof Provost, Vin√≠cius Zavam,  Paul Herman
Affects:        FreeBSD 11.x
Corrected:      2017-07-20 17:15:18 UTC (stable/11, 11.1-STABLE)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

pf(4) is one of several packet filter available in FreeBSD, originally
written for OpenBSD.  In addition to filtering packets, it also has packet
normalization capabilities.

II.  Problem Description

A pf housekeeping thread (pf_purge_thread) could potentially use an
uninitialized variable, leading to a division by zero and a kernel panic.

III. Impact

Affected systems panic during startup.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not loading the pf kernel module are
not affected.  Once a system has started successfully it will not be at risk
of this problem until it is restarted.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Afterward, reboot the system.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Afterward, reboot the system.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:08/pf.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:08/pf.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pf.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

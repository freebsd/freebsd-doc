Topic:		golddig port allows users to overwrite local files

Category:       ports
Module:         golddig
Announced:      2000-05-09
Credits:	Discovered during internal ports collection auditing.
Affects:        Ports collection.
Corrected:      2000-04-30
Vendor status:	Email bounced.
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

Golddig is an X11 game provided as part of the FreeBSD ports collection.

II.  Problem Description

The golddig port erroneously installs a level-creation utility setuid
root, which allows users to overwrite the contents of arbitrary local
files. It is not believed that any elevation of privileges is possible
with this vulnerability because the contents of the file are a textual
representation of a golddig game level which is highly constrained.

The golddig port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 3200 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format. The ports collection shipped with FreeBSD 4.0 contains this
problem since it was discovered after the release.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

An unprivileged local user can overwrite the contents of any file,
although they are restricted in the possible contents of the new file.

If you have not chosen to install the golddig port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

One of the following:

1) Deinstall the golddig port/package, if you you have installed it.

2) Remove the setuid bit from /usr/local/bin/makelev. This will mean
unprivileged users cannot create or modify golddig levels except in
their own directories.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the golddig port.

2) Reinstall a new package dated after the correction date, obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/games/golddig-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/games/golddig-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-4-stable/games/golddig-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/games/golddig-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/alpha/packages-5-current/games/golddig-2.0.tgz

Note: it may be several days before the updated packages are available.

3) download a new port skeleton for the golddig port from:

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/packages/devel/portcheckout-1.0.tgz

+NTP 4.2.8p11 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2018/02/27)
+
+NOTE: this NEWS file will be undergoing more revisions.
+
+Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.
+
+Severity: MEDIUM
+
+This release fixes 2 low-/medium-, 1 informational/medum-, and 2 low-severity
+vulnerabilities in ntpd, one medium-severity vulernability in ntpq, and
+provides 65 other non-security fixes and improvements:
+
+* NTP Bug 3454: Unauthenticated packet can reset authenticated interleaved
+	association (LOW/MED)
+   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p11) 27 Feb 2018
+   References: Sec 3454 / CVE-2018-7185 / VU#961909
+   Affects: ntp-4.2.6, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p11.
+   CVSS2: MED 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) This could score between
+	2.9 and 6.8.
+   CVSS3: LOW 3.1 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L This could
+	score between 2.6 and 3.1
+   Summary:
+	The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and
+	authenticated associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer),
+	and several broadcast modes. In addition to the basic NTP
+	operational modes, symmetric mode and broadcast servers can
+	support an interleaved mode of operation. In ntp-4.2.8p4 a bug
+	was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that
+	allows a non-authenticated zero-origin (reset) packet to reset
+	an authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker
+	can send a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and the source
+	IP address of the "other side" of an interleaved association,
+	the 'victim' ntpd will reset its association. The attacker must
+	continue sending these packets in order to maintain the
+	disruption of the association. In ntp-4.0.0 thru ntp-4.2.8p6,
+	interleave mode could be entered dynamically. As of ntp-4.2.8p7,
+	interleaved mode must be explicitly configured/enabled.
+   Mitigation:
+	Implement BCP-38.
+	Upgrade to 4.2.8p11, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
+	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
+	If you are unable to upgrade to 4.2.8p11 or later and have
+	    'peer HOST xleave' lines in your ntp.conf file, remove the
+	    'xleave' option.
+	Have enough sources of time.
+	Properly monitor your ntpd instances.
+	If ntpd stops running, auto-restart it without -g .
+   Credit:
+   	This weakness was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.
+
+* NTP Bug 3453: Interleaved symmetric mode cannot recover from bad
+	state (LOW/MED)
+   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p11) 27 Feb 2018
+   References: Sec 3453 / CVE-2018-7184 / VU#961909
+   Affects: ntpd in ntp-4.2.8p4, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p11.
+   CVSS2: MED 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
+	Could score between 2.9 and 6.8.
+   CVSS3: LOW 3.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
+	Could score between 2.6 and 6.0.
+   Summary:
+   	The fix for NtpBug2952 was incomplete, and while it fixed one
+	problem it created another.  Specifically, it drops bad packets
+	before updating the "received" timestamp.  This means a
+	third-party can inject a packet with a zero-origin timestamp,
+	meaning the sender wants to reset the association, and the
+	transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the
+	most recent "received" timestamp.  The real remote peer does
+	not know this value and this will disrupt the association until
+	the association resets.
+   Mitigation:
+	Implement BCP-38.
+	Upgrade to ntp-4.2.8p11 or later from the NTP Project Download Page
+	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
+	Use authentication with 'peer' mode.
+	Have enough sources of time.
+	Properly monitor your ntpd instances.
+	If ntpd stops running, auto-restart it without -g .
+   Credit:
+   	This weakness was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.
+
+* NTP Bug 3415: Provide a way to prevent authenticated symmetric passive
+	peering (LOW)
+   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p11) 27 Feb 2018
+   References: Sec 3415 / CVE-2018-7170 / VU#961909
+   	       Sec 3012 / CVE-2016-1549 / VU#718152
+   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
+   	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92.  Resolved in 4.2.8p11.
+   CVSS2: LOW 3.5 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
+   CVSS3: LOW 3.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
+   Summary:
+	ntpd can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks.  If a system is set up to
+	use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced in
+	ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to
+	specify which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer
+	-- i.e. one where the attacker knows the private symmetric key --
+	can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win
+	the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock.  Three
+	additional protections are offered in ntp-4.2.8p11.  One is the
+	new 'noepeer' directive, which disables symmetric passive
+	ephemeral peering. Another is the new 'ippeerlimit' directive,
+	which limits the number of peers that can be created from an IP.
+	The third extends the functionality of the 4th field in the
+	ntp.keys file to include specifying a subnet range.
+   Mitigation:
+	Implement BCP-38.
+	Upgrade to ntp-4.2.8p11 or later from the NTP Project Download Page
+	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
+	Use the 'noepeer' directive to prohibit symmetric passive
+	    ephemeral associations.
+	Use the 'ippeerlimit' directive to limit the number of peers
+	    that can be created from an IP.
+	Use the 4th argument in the ntp.keys file to limit the IPs and
+	    subnets that can be time servers.
+	Have enough sources of time.
+	Properly monitor your ntpd instances.
+	If ntpd stops running, auto-restart it without -g .
+   Credit:
+	This weakness was reported as Bug 3012 by Matthew Van Gundy of
+	Cisco ASIG, and separately by Stefan Moser as Bug 3415.
+
+* ntpq Bug 3414: decodearr() can write beyond its 'buf' limits (Medium)
+   Date Resolved: 27 Feb 2018
+   References: Sec 3414 / CVE-2018-7183 / VU#961909
+   Affects: ntpq in ntp-4.2.8p6, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p11.
+   CVSS2: MED 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
+   CVSS3: MED 5.0 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
+   Summary:
+   	ntpq is a monitoring and control program for ntpd.  decodearr()
+	is an internal function of ntpq that is used to -- wait for it --
+	decode an array in a response string when formatted data is being
+	displayed.  This is a problem in affected versions of ntpq if a
+	maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array result that will trip this
+	bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq request on its way to
+	a remote ntpd server and forge and send a response before the remote
+	ntpd sends its response.  It's potentially possible that the
+	malicious data could become injectable/executable code.
+   Mitigation:
+	Implement BCP-38.
+	Upgrade to ntp-4.2.8p11 or later from the NTP Project Download Page
+	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
+   Credit:
+	This weakness was discovered by Michael Macnair of Thales e-Security.
+
+* NTP Bug 3412: ctl_getitem(): buffer read overrun leads to undefined
+	behavior and information leak (Info/Medium)
+   Date Resolved: 27 Feb 2018
+   References: Sec 3412 / CVE-2018-7182 / VU#961909
+   Affects: ntp-4.2.8p6, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p11.
+   CVSS2: INFO 0.0 - MED 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 0.0 if C:N
+   CVSS3: NONE 0.0 - MED 5.3 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
+	0.0 if C:N
+   Summary:
+	ctl_getitem()  is used by ntpd to process incoming mode 6 packets.
+	A malicious mode 6 packet can be sent to an ntpd instance, and
+	if the ntpd instance is from 4.2.8p6 thru 4.2.8p10, that will
+	cause ctl_getitem() to read past the end of its buffer.
+   Mitigation:
+	Implement BCP-38.
+	Upgrade to ntp-4.2.8p11 or later from the NTP Project Download Page
+	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
+	Have enough sources of time.
+	Properly monitor your ntpd instances.
+	If ntpd stops running, auto-restart it without -g .
+   Credit:
+   	This weakness was discovered by Yihan Lian of Qihoo 360.
+
+* NTP Bug 3012: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack
+   Also see Bug 3415, above.
+   Date Mitigated: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016

+ Fix trivial warnings from 'make check'. perlinger@ntp.org
+ Fix bug in the override portion of the compiler hardening macro. HStenn.
+ record_raw_stats(): Log entire packet.  Log writes.  HStenn.
+ AES-128-CMAC support.  BInglis, HStenn, JPerlinger.
+ sntp: tweak key file logging.  HStenn.
+ sntp: pkt_output(): Improve debug output.  HStenn.
+ update-leap: updates from Paul McMath.
+ When using pkg-config, report --modversion.  HStenn.
+ Clean up libevent configure checks.  HStenn.
+ sntp: show the IP of who sent us a crypto-NAK.  HStenn.
+ Allow .../N to specify subnet bits for IPs in ntp.keys.  HStenn, JPerlinger.
+ authistrustedip() - use it in more places.  HStenn, JPerlinger.
+ New sysstats: sys_lamport, sys_tsrounding.  HStenn.
+ Update ntp.keys .../N documentation.  HStenn.
+ Distribute testconf.yml.  HStenn.
+ Add DPRINTF(2,...) lines to receive() for packet drops.  HStenn.

+ Provide dump_restricts() for debugging.  HStenn.
+ Use consistent 4th arg type for [gs]etsockopt.  JPerlinger.
+
+* Other items:
+
+* update-leap needs the following perl modules:
+	Net::SSLeay
+	IO::Socket::SSL
+
+* New sysstats variables: sys_lamport, sys_tsrounding
+See them with: ntpq -c "rv 0 ss_lamport,ss_tsrounding"
+sys_lamport counts the number of observed Lamport violations, while
+sys_tsrounding counts observed timestamp rounding events.
+
+* New ntp.conf items:
+
+- restrict ... noepeer
+- restrict ... ippeerlimit N
+
+The 'noepeer' directive will disallow all ephemeral/passive peer
+requests.
+
+The 'ippeerlimit' directive limits the number of time associations
+for each IP in the designated set of addresses.  This limit does not
+apply to explicitly-configured associations.  A value of -1, the current
+default, means an unlimited number of associations may connect from a
+single IP.  0 means "none", etc.  Ordinarily the only way multiple
+associations would come from the same IP would be if the remote side
+was using a proxy.  But a trusted machine might become compromised,
+in which case an attacker might spin up multiple authenticated sessions
+from different ports.  This directive should be helpful in this case.
+
+* New ntp.keys feature: Each IP in the optional list of IPs in the 4th
+field may contain a /subnetbits specification, which identifies  the
+scope of IPs that may use this key.  This IP/subnet restriction can be
+used to limit the IPs that may use the key in most all situations where
+a key is used.

 <p>An example may clarify how it works. Our campus has two class-B networks, 128.4 for the ECE and CIS departments and 128.175 for the rest of campus. Let's assume (not true!) that subnet 128.4.1 homes critical services like class rosters and spread sheets. A suitable ACL might look like this:</p>

 <p>By default, the client sends non-authenticated packets and the server responds with non-authenticated packets.  If the client sends authenticated packets, the server responds with authenticated packets if correct, or a crypto-NAK packet if not.  In the case of unsolicited packets which might consume significant resources, such as broadcast or symmetric mode packets, authentication is required, unless overridden by a <tt>disable auth</tt> command.  In the current climate of targeted broadcast or &quot;letterbomb&quot; attacks, defeating this requirement would be decidedly dangerous.  In any case, the <tt>notrust </tt>flag, described on the <a href="authopt.html">Access Control Options</a> page, can be used to disable access to all but correctly authenticated clients.</p>
 <h4 id="symm">Symmetric Key Cryptography</h4>
 <p>The original NTPv3 specification (RFC-1305), as well as the current NTPv4 specification (RFC-5905), allows any one of possibly 65,534 message digest keys (excluding zero), each distinguished by a 32-bit key ID, to authenticate an association.  The servers and clients involved must agree on the key ID, key type and key to authenticate NTP packets.</p>
-<p>The message digest is a cryptographic hash computed by an algorithm such as MD5 or SHA.  When authentication is specified, a message authentication code (MAC) is appended to the NTP packet header.  The MAC consists of a 32-bit key identifier (key ID) followed by a 128- or 160-bit message digest.  The algorithm computes the digest as the hash of a 128- or 160- bit message digest key concatenated with the NTP packet header fields with the exception of the MAC.  On transmit, the message digest is computed and inserted in the MAC.  On receive, the message digest is computed and compared with the MAC.  The packet is accepted only if the two MACs are identical.  If a discrepancy is found by the client, the client ignores the packet, but raises an alarm.  If this happens at the server, the server returns a special message called a <em>crypto-NAK</em>.  Since the crypto-NAK is protected by the loopback test, an intruder cannot disrupt the protocol by sending a bogus crypto-NAK.</p>

 <p>Keys and related information are specified in a keys file, which must be distributed and stored using secure means beyond the scope of the NTP protocol itself.  Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys can be used as passwords for the <tt><a href="ntpq.html">ntpq</a></tt> and <tt><a href="ntpdc.html">ntpdc</a></tt> utility programs.  Ordinarily, the <tt>ntp.keys</tt> file is generated by the <tt><a href="keygen.html">ntp-keygen</a></tt> program, but it can be constructed and edited using an ordinary text editor.</p>
 <p> Each line of the keys file consists of three or four fields: a key ID in the range 1 to 65,534, inclusive, a key type, a message digest key consisting of a printable ASCII string less than 40 characters or a 40-character hex digit string, and an optional comma-separated list of IPs that are allowed to serve time.  If the OpenSSL library is installed, the key type can be any message digest algorithm supported by the library.  If the OpenSSL library is not installed, the only permitted key type is MD5.</p>

It can generate  message digest keys used in symmetric   key cryptography and, if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it can generate host keys, sign keys, certificates, and identity keys and parameters used by the Autokey public key cryptography. The message digest keys file is generated in a format compatible with NTPv3. All other files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to other sites.</p>
-<p>When used to generate message digest keys, the program produces a file containing
-  ten pseudo-random printable ASCII strings suitable for the MD5 message digest algorithm included in the distribution. If the OpenSSL library is installed, it produces an additional ten hex-encoded random bit strings suitable for the SHA1 and other message digest algorithms. The message digest keys file  must be distributed and stored using secure means beyond the scope of  NTP  itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys can be defined as passwords for the <tt><a href="ntpq.html">ntpq</a></tt> and <tt><a href="ntpdc.html">ntpdc</a></tt> utility programs.</p>
-<p>The remaining generated files are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and other Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) resources. Certificates generated by this program are compatible with extant industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the identity keys are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.</p>
-<p>Some files used by this program are encrypted using a private password. The <tt>-p</tt> option specifies the password for local encrypted files and the <tt>-q</tt> option the password for encrypted files sent to remote sites. If no  password is specified, the host name returned by the Unix <tt>gethostname()</tt> function, normally the DNS name of the host, is used.</p>
-<p>The <tt>pw</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command specifies the read password for previously encrypted local files. This must match the local password used by this program. If not specified, the host name is used. Thus, if files are generated by this program without password, they can be read back by <tt>ntpd</tt> without password, but only on the same host.</p>
-<p>Normally, encrypted files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page. The symmetric keys file, normally called <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, is usually installed in <tt>/etc</tt>. Other files and links are usually installed   in  <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>, which is normally in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks and cannot be changed by shared clients. The location of the keys directory can be changed by the <tt>keysdir</tt> configuration command in such cases. Normally, this is in <tt>/etc</tt>.</p>
-<p>This program directs commentary and error messages to the standard error stream <tt>stderr</tt> and remote files to the standard output stream <tt>stdout</tt> where they can be piped to other applications or redirected to  files. The names used for generated files and links all begin with the string <tt>ntpkey</tt> and include the file type, generating host and filestamp, as described in the <a href="#fmt">Cryptographic Data Files</a> section below</p>
-<h4 id="run">Running the Program</h4>
-<p>To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and change to the keys directory, usually <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>. When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning <tt>ntpkey</tt> have been removed, use the <tt>ntp-keygen </tt>command without arguments to generate a default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration date one year hence. If run again without options, the program uses the existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with new expiration date one year hence.</p>
-<p>Run the command on as many hosts as necessary. Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the <tt>-T</tt> option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers. Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or indirectly. A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then provided to the immediately descendant host on request. All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.</p>
-<p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be RSA type. By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures. A different sign key can be assigned using the <tt>-S</tt> option and this can be either RSA or DSA type. By default, the signature message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified using the <tt>-c</tt> option.</p>
-<dd>The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before this program is run. This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem when the host is started for the first time. Accordingly, the host time should be set by some other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year. After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the certificate should be re-generated.</dd>

The host name, and if provided, group name are used in <tt><i>host</i>@<i>group</i></tt> form as certificate subject and issuer.  Specifying <tt>-s @<i>group</i></tt> is allowed, and results in leaving the host name unchanged, as with <tt>-i <i>group</i></tt>. The group name, or if no group is provided, the host name are also used in the file names of IFF, GQ, and MV identity scheme parameter files.

-</dl>
-<h4 id="rand">Random Seed File</h4>
-<p>All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal pseudo-random number generator used by the OpenSSL library routines. If a site supports <tt>ssh</tt>, it is very likely that means to do this are already available. The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a file, usually called <tt>.rnd</tt>, which must be available when starting the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program or <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon.</p>
-<p>The OpenSSL library looks for the file using the path specified by the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable in the user home directory, whether root or some other user. If the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable is not present, the library looks for the <tt>.rnd</tt> file in the user home directory. Since both the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program and <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon must run as root, the logical place to put this file is in <tt>/.rnd</tt> or <tt>/root/.rnd</tt>. If the file is not available or cannot be written, the program exits with a message to the system log.</p>
-<h4 id="fmt">Cryptographic Data Files</h4>
-<p>File and link names are in the form <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>name</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>, where <tt><i>key</i></tt> is the key or parameter type, <tt><i>name</i></tt> is the host or group name and <tt><i>fstamp</i></tt> is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when the file was created). By convention, <em><tt>key</tt></em> names in generated file names include both upper and lower case  characters, while  <em><tt>key</tt></em> names in generated link names include only lower case characters. The filestamp is not used in generated link names.</p>
-<p>The  <em><tt>key</tt></em> name is a string defining the cryptographic key type. Key types include public/private keys <tt>host</tt> and <tt>sign</tt>, certificate <tt>cert</tt> and several challenge/response key types. By convention, client files used for challenges have a <tt>par</tt> subtype, as in the IFF challenge <tt>IFFpar</tt>, while server files for responses have a <tt>key</tt> subtype, as in the GQ response <tt>GQkey</tt>.</p>
-<p>All files begin with two nonencrypted lines. The first line contains the file name in the format <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>host</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>. The second line contains the datestamp in conventional Unix <tt>date</tt> format. Lines beginning with <tt>#</tt> are ignored.</p>
-<p>The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data encoded first using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted using the DES-CBC algorithm with given password and finally written in PEM-encoded printable ASCII text preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.</p>
-<p>The format of the symmetric keys file, ordinarily named <tt>ntp.keys,</tt> is somewhat different than the other files in the interest of backward compatibility. Ordinarily, the file is generated by this program, but it can be constructed and edited using an ordinary text editor.</p>
-<div align="center">
-  <p><img src="pic/sx5.gif" alt="gif"></p>
-  <p>Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File</p>
-</div>
-<p>Figure 1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference implementation.  Each line of the file contains three fields, first an integer between 1 and 65534, inclusive, representing the key identifier used in the <tt>server</tt> and <tt>peer</tt> configuration commands. Next is the key type for the message digest algorithm, which in the absence of the OpenSSL library must be  <tt>MD5</tt> to designate the  MD5 message digest algorithm. If the OpenSSL library is installed, the key type can be any message digest algorithm supported by that library. However, if compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, the key type must be either <tt>SHA</tt> or <tt>SHA1</tt>. The key type can be changed using an ASCII text editor.</p>
-<p>   An MD5 key consists of a   printable ASCII string less than or equal to 16 characters and terminated by  whitespace or a # character.   An OpenSSL key consists of a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is truncated as necessary.</p>
-<p>Note that the keys used by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs are checked against passwords requested by the programs and entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in human readable ASCII format.</p>
-<p>The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a MD5 symmetric keys file <tt>ntpkey_MD5key_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>. Since the file contains private shared keys, it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts. The NTP daemon loads the file <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs a soft link from this name to the generated file. Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated means on the other subnet hosts. While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration commands used by the <a href="ntpq.html"><tt>ntpq</tt></a> and <a href="ntpdc.html"><tt>ntpdc</tt></a> utilities.</p>
-<h4 id="bug">Bugs</h4>
-<p>It can take quite a while to generate some cryptographic values, from one to several minutes with modern architectures such as UltraSPARC and up to tens of minutes to an hour with older architectures such as SPARC IPC.</p>

+    <h4 id="rand">Random Seed File</h4>
+    <p>All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to
+      randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal
+      pseudo-random number generator used by the OpenSSL library routines.
+      If a site supports <tt>ssh</tt>, it is very likely that means to do
+      this are already available.  The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL
+      library is contained in a file, usually called <tt>.rnd</tt>, which
+      must be available when starting the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program
+      or <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon.</p>
+    <p>The OpenSSL library looks for the file using the path specified by
+      the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable in the user home directory,
+      whether root or some other user.  If the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment
+      variable is not present, the library looks for the <tt>.rnd</tt> file
+      in the user home directory.  Since both the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt>
+      program and <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon must run as root, the logical place
+      to put this file is in <tt>/.rnd</tt> or <tt>/root/.rnd</tt>.  If the
+      file is not available or cannot be written, the program exits with a
+      message to the system log.</p>
+    <h4 id="fmt">Cryptographic Data Files</h4>
+    <p>File and link names are in the
+      form <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>name</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>,
+      where <tt><i>key</i></tt> is the key or parameter
+      type, <tt><i>name</i></tt> is the host or group name
+      and <tt><i>fstamp</i></tt> is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when the
+      file was created).  By convention, <em><tt>key</tt></em> names in
+      generated file names include both upper and lower case characters,
+      while <em><tt>key</tt></em> names in generated link names include only
+      lower case characters.  The filestamp is not used in generated link
+      names.</p>
+    <p>The <em><tt>key</tt></em> name is a string defining the cryptographic
+      key type.  Key types include public/private keys <tt>host</tt>
+      and <tt>sign</tt>, certificate <tt>cert</tt> and several
+      challenge/response key types.  By convention, client files used for
+      challenges have a <tt>par</tt> subtype, as in the IFF
+      challenge <tt>IFFpar</tt>, while server files for responses have
+      a <tt>key</tt> subtype, as in the GQ response <tt>GQkey</tt>.</p>
+    <p>All files begin with two nonencrypted lines.  The first line contains
+    the file name in the
+    format <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>host</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>.  The second
+    line contains the datestamp in conventional Unix <tt>date</tt> format.
+    Lines beginning with <tt>#</tt> are ignored.</p>
+    <p>The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data encoded first
+      using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted using the DES-CBC algorithm with
+      given password and finally written in PEM-encoded printable ASCII text
+      preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.</p>
+    <p>The format of the symmetric keys file, ordinarily
+      named <tt>ntp.keys,</tt> is somewhat different than the other files in
+      the interest of backward compatibility.  Ordinarily, the file is
+      generated by this program, but it can be constructed and edited using
+      an ordinary text editor.</p>

+    <p>Figure 1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference
+      implementation.  Each line of the file contains three or four fields,
+      first an integer between 1 and 65534, inclusive, representing the key
+      identifier used in the <tt>server</tt> and <tt>peer</tt> configuration
+      commands.  Second is the key type for the message digest algorithm,
+      which in the absence of the OpenSSL library must be <tt>MD5</tt> to
+      designate the MD5 message digest algorithm.  If the OpenSSL library is
+      installed, the key type can be any message digest algorithm supported
+      by that library.  However, if compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is
+      required, the key type must be either <tt>SHA</tt> or <tt>SHA1</tt>.
+      The key type can be changed using an ASCII text editor.</p>
+    <p>The third field is the key.</p>
+    <p>An MD5 key consists of a printable ASCII string less than or equal to
+      16 characters and terminated by whitespace or a # character.  An
+      OpenSSL key consists of a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters,
+      which is truncated as necessary.</p>
+    <p>Note that the keys used by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt>
+      programs are checked against passwords requested by the programs and
+      entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys
+      in human readable ASCII format.</p>
+    <p>The optional fourth field is one or more IPs, with each IP separated
+      with a comma.  An IP may end with an optional <tt>/subnetbits</tt>
+      suffix, which limits the acceptance of the key identifier to packets
+      claiming to be from the described IP space.</p>
+    <p>The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a MD5 symmetric keys
+      file <tt>ntpkey_MD5key_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>.  Since the file
+      contains private shared keys, it should be visible only to root and
+      distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts.  The NTP daemon
+      loads the file <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs a
+      soft link from this name to the generated file.  Subsequently, similar
+      soft links must be installed by manual or automated means on the other
+      subnet hosts.  While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2
+      protocol, it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration
+      commands used by the <a href="ntpq.html"><tt>ntpq</tt></a>
+      and <a href="ntpdc.html"><tt>ntpdc</tt></a> utilities.</p>

   <dd>This command alters certain system variables used by the the clock selection and clustering algorithms. The default values of these variables have been carefully optimized for a wide range of network speeds and reliability expectations. Very rarely is it necessary to change the default values; but, some folks can't resist twisting the knobs. It can be used to select the quality and quantity of peers used to synchronize the system clock and is most useful in dynamic server discovery schemes. The options are as follows:</dd>

NTP Broadcast networks are expected to be trusted, and if the server's time gets stepped backwards then it's desireable that the clients follow this change as soon as possible.  However, in spite of various protections built-in to the broadcast protocol, it is possible that an attacker could perform a carefully-constructed replay attack and cause clients to erroneously step their clocks backward.  If the risk of a successful broadcast replay attack is greater than the risk of the clients being out of sync in the event that there is a backward step on the broadcast time servers, this option may be used to cause the clients to delay beliveving backward time steps until <i>poll-gate</i> consecutive polls have been received.  The default is 0, which means the client will accept these steps upon receipt.  Any value from 0 to 4 can be specified.</dd>

-        This can be run as a cron job. As the file is rarely updated, and

-        For cron-friendly behavior, define CRONJOB=1 in the crontab.
+SSL/TLS Considerations
+-----------------------
+The perl modules can usually locate the CA certificate used to verify
+the peer's identity.
 
-        Version $VERSION
+On BSDs, the default is typically the file /etc/ssl/certs.pem.  On
+Linux, the location is typically a path to a CAdir - a directory of
+symlinks named according to a hash of the certificates' subject names.
+
+The -C or -D options are available to pass in a location if no CA cert
+is found in the default location.
+
+External Dependencies
+---------------------
+The following perl modules are required:
+HTTP::Tiny         - version >= 0.056
+IO::Socket::SSL - version >= 1.56
+NET::SSLeay         - version >= 1.49

+SSL/TLS Considerations

+Linux, the location is typically a path to a CAdir - a directory of
+symlinks named according to a hash of the certificates' subject names.
 
-	    # While the shell script version will set correct permissions
-	    # on temporary file, for the perl version that's harder, so
-	    # for now at least one should run this script as the
-	    # appropriate user.
+The -C or -D options are available to pass in a location if no CA cert
+is found in the default location.

 @subsubsection Running the Program
-To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and
-change to the keys directory, usually
-@file{/usr/local/etc}
-When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning with
-@kbd{ntpkey}
-have been removed, use the
-@code{ntp-keygen}
-command without arguments to generate a
-default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration
-date one year hence.
-If run again without options, the program uses the
-existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with
-new expiration date one year hence.
-
-Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.
-Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
-@code{ntp-keygen}
-with the
-@code{-T}
-option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.
-Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
-indirectly.
-A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
-ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
-provided to the immediately descendant host on request.
-All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
-
-The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
-RSA type.
-By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
-signatures.
-A different sign key can be assigned using the
-@code{-S}
-option and this can be either RSA or DSA type.
-By default, the signature
-message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
-message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
-using the
-@code{-c}
-option.
-The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
-filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
-this program is run.
-This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem
-when the host is started for the first time.
-Accordingly, the host time
-should be set by some other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at
-least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year.
-After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
-certificate should be re-generated.

-The
-@code{ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)}
-configuration command
-@code{crypto} @code{pw} @kbd{password}
-specifies the read password for previously encrypted files.
-The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing
-or incorrect.
-For convenience, if a file has been previously encrypted,
-the default read password is the name of the host running
-the program.
-If the previous write password is specified as the host name,
-these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.
-
-
-File names begin with the prefix
-@code{ntpkey_}
-and end with the postfix
-@kbd{_hostname.filestamp},
-where
-@kbd{hostname}
-is the owner name, usually the string returned
-by the Unix gethostname() routine, and
-@kbd{filestamp}
-is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.
-This both guarantees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance
-procedures, since all files can be quickly removed
-by a
-@code{rm} @code{ntpkey*}
-command or all files generated
-at a specific time can be removed by a

-Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host
-and used only by that host, although exceptions exist

-
-Normally, files containing private values,
-including the host key, sign key and identification parameters,
-are permitted root read/write-only;
-while others containing public values are permitted world readable.
-Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted
-and these files permitted world readable,
-which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.
-Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and
-file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and
-dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.
-
-The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions
-when installing a file and to install a soft link
-from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page
-to the generated files.
-This allows new file generations to be activated simply

-This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times

 .Ss Running the Program
-To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and
-change to the keys directory, usually
-.Pa /usr/local/etc 
-When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning with
-.Ar ntpkey
-have been removed, use the
-.Nm
-command without arguments to generate a
-default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration
-date one year hence.
-If run again without options, the program uses the
-existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with
-new expiration date one year hence.
-.Pp
-Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.
-Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
-.Nm
-with the
-.Fl T
-option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.
-Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
-indirectly.
-A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
-ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
-provided to the immediately descendant host on request.
-All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
-.Pp
-The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
-RSA type.
-By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
-signatures.
-A different sign key can be assigned using the
-.Fl S
-option and this can be either RSA or DSA type.
-By default, the signature
-message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
-message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
-using the
-.Fl c
-option.
-The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
-filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
-this program is run.
-This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem
-when the host is started for the first time.
-Accordingly, the host time
-should be set by some other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at
-least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year.
-After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
-certificate should be re-generated.
-.Pp
-Additional information on trusted groups and identity schemes is on the
-.Dq Autokey Public-Key Authentication
-page.
-
-
-.Pp
-The
-.Xr ntpd 1ntpdmdoc
-configuration command
-.Ic crypto pw Ar password
-specifies the read password for previously encrypted files.
-The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing
-or incorrect.
-For convenience, if a file has been previously encrypted,
-the default read password is the name of the host running
-the program.
-If the previous write password is specified as the host name,
-these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.
-
-.Pp
-File names begin with the prefix
-.Cm ntpkey_
-and end with the postfix
-.Ar _hostname.filestamp ,
-where
-.Ar hostname
-is the owner name, usually the string returned
-by the Unix gethostname() routine, and
-.Ar filestamp
-is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.
-This both guarantees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance
-procedures, since all files can be quickly removed
-by a
-.Ic rm ntpkey\&*
-command or all files generated
-at a specific time can be removed by a
-.Ic rm
-.Ar \&*filestamp
-command.
-To further reduce the risk of misconfiguration,
-the first two lines of a file contain the file name
-and generation date and time as comments.
-.Pp
-All files are installed by default in the keys directory
-.Pa /usr/local/etc ,
-which is normally in a shared filesystem
-in NFS-mounted networks.
-The actual location of the keys directory
-and each file can be overridden by configuration commands,
-but this is not recommended.
-Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host
-and used only by that host, although exceptions exist
-as noted later on this page.
-.Pp
-Normally, files containing private values,
-including the host key, sign key and identification parameters,
-are permitted root read/write-only;
-while others containing public values are permitted world readable.
-Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted
-and these files permitted world readable,
-which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.
-Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and
-file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and
-dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.
-.Pp
-The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions
-when installing a file and to install a soft link
-from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page
-to the generated files.
-This allows new file generations to be activated simply
-by changing the link.
-If a link is present, ntpd follows it to the file name
-to extract the filestamp.
-If a link is not present,
-.Xr ntpd 1ntpdmdoc
-extracts the filestamp from the file itself.
-This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times
-are always current.
-The
-.Nm
-program uses the same timestamp extension for all files generated
-at one time, so each generation is distinct and can be readily
-recognized in monitoring data.

 program is logged in directly as root.

-If run again without options, the program uses the

-.Pp
-Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.
-Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
-.Nm
-with the
-.Fl T
-option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.
-Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
-indirectly.
-A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
-ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
-provided to the immediately descendant host on request.
-All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
-.Pp
-The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
-RSA type.
-By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
-signatures.
-A different sign key can be assigned using the
-.Fl S
-option and this can be either RSA or DSA type.
-By default, the signature
-message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
-message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
-using the
-.Fl c
-option.
-The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
-filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
-this program is run.
-This of course creates a chicken\-and\-egg problem
-when the host is started for the first time.
-Accordingly, the host time
-should be set by some other means, such as eyeball\-and\-wristwatch, at
-least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year.
-After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
-certificate should be re\-generated.
-.Pp
-Additional information on trusted groups and identity schemes is on the
-.Dq Autokey Public\-Key Authentication

-The
-.Xr ntpd 1ntpdmdoc
-configuration command
-.Ic crypto pw Ar password
-specifies the read password for previously encrypted files.
-The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing
-or incorrect.
-For convenience, if a file has been previously encrypted,
-the default read password is the name of the host running
-the program.
-If the previous write password is specified as the host name,
-these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.
-.Pp
-File names begin with the prefix
-.Cm ntpkey_

-is the owner name, usually the string returned
-by the Unix gethostname() routine, and
-.Ar filestamp
-is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.

-Normally, files containing private values,

-are permitted root read/write\-only;
-while others containing public values are permitted world readable.
-Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted
-and these files permitted world readable,
-which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.
-Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and
-file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and

-.Pp
-The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions
-when installing a file and to install a soft link
-from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page
-to the generated files.
-This allows new file generations to be activated simply

-If a link is present, ntpd follows it to the file name

-This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times

-command without arguments to generate a
-default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration
-date one year hence. 
-If run again without options, the program uses the
-existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with

-
-  <p>Run the command on as many hosts as necessary. 
-Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
-<code>ntp-keygen</code>
-with the
-<code>-T</code>
-option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers. 
-Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
-indirectly. 
-A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
-ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
-provided to the immediately descendant host on request. 
-All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
-
-  <p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
-RSA type. 
-By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
-signatures. 
-A different sign key can be assigned using the
-<code>-S</code>
-option and this can be either RSA or DSA type. 
-By default, the signature
-message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
-message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
-using the
-<code>-c</code>
-option. 
-The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
-filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
-this program is run. 
-This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem
-when the host is started for the first time. 
-Accordingly, the host time

-When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning with

-have been removed, use the

-date one year hence.
-If run again without options, the program uses the
-existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with

-.Pp
-Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.
-Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
-.Nm
-with the
-.Fl T
-option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.
-Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
-indirectly.
-A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
-ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
-provided to the immediately descendant host on request.
-All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
-.Pp
-The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
-RSA type.
-By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
-signatures.
-A different sign key can be assigned using the
-.Fl S
-option and this can be either RSA or DSA type.
-By default, the signature
-message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
-message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
-using the
-.Fl c
-option.
-The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
-filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
-this program is run.
-This of course creates a chicken\-and\-egg problem
-when the host is started for the first time.
-Accordingly, the host time
-should be set by some other means, such as eyeball\-and\-wristwatch, at
-least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year.
-After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
-certificate should be re\-generated.
-.Pp
-Additional information on trusted groups and identity schemes is on the

-The
-.Xr ntpd @NTPD_MS@
-configuration command
-.Ic crypto pw Ar password
-specifies the read password for previously encrypted files.
-The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing
-or incorrect.
-For convenience, if a file has been previously encrypted,
-the default read password is the name of the host running
-the program.
-If the previous write password is specified as the host name,
-these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.
-.Pp
-File names begin with the prefix
-.Cm ntpkey_
-and end with the postfix

-where

-is the owner name, usually the string returned
-by the Unix gethostname() routine, and
-.Ar filestamp
-is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.

-Normally, files containing private values,

-are permitted root read/write\-only;
-while others containing public values are permitted world readable.
-Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted
-and these files permitted world readable,
-which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.
-Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and
-file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and
-dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.

-The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions
-when installing a file and to install a soft link
-from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page
-to the generated files.
-This allows new file generations to be activated simply

-If a link is present, ntpd follows it to the file name

-This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times

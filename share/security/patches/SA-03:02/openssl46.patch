   OpenSSL CHANGES
   _______________
  
+  Changes between 0.9.6h and 0.9.6i  [19 Feb 2003]
+ 
+   *) In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
+      via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrrect
+      block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
+      against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
+      between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (CAN-2003-0078)
+ 
+      [Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Brice Canvel (EPFL),
+      Alain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and
+      Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL, Ilion)]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6g and 0.9.6h  [5 Dec 2002]
+ 
+   *) New function OPENSSL_cleanse(), which is used to cleanse a section of
+      memory from it's contents.  This is done with a counter that will
+      place alternating values in each byte.  This can be used to solve
+      two issues: 1) the removal of calls to memset() by highly optimizing
+      compilers, and 2) cleansing with other values than 0, since those can
+      be read through on certain media, for example a swap space on disk.
+      [Geoff Thorpe]
+ 
+   *) Bugfix: client side session caching did not work with external caching,
+      because the session->cipher setting was not restored when reloading
+      from the external cache. This problem was masked, when
+      SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG (part of SSL_OP_ALL) was set.
+      (Found by Steve Haslam <steve@araqnid.ddts.net>.)
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix client_certificate (ssl/s2_clnt.c): The permissible total
+      length of the REQUEST-CERTIFICATE message is 18 .. 34, not 17 .. 33.
+      [Zeev Lieber <zeev-l@yahoo.com>]
+ 
+   *) Undo an undocumented change introduced in 0.9.6e which caused
+      repeated calls to OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers() and 
+      OpenSSL_add_all_digests() to be ignored, even after calling
+      EVP_cleanup().
+      [Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Change the default configuration reader to deal with last line not
+      being properly terminated.
+      [Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Change X509_NAME_cmp() so it applies the special rules on handling
+      DN values that are of type PrintableString, as well as RDNs of type
+      emailAddress where the value has the type ia5String.
+      [stefank@valicert.com via Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Add a SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE flag to take over half
+      the job SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP was inconsistently
+      doing, define a new flag (SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL) to be
+      the bitwise-OR of the two for use by the majority of applications
+      wanting this behaviour, and update the docs. The documented
+      behaviour and actual behaviour were inconsistent and had been
+      changing anyway, so this is more a bug-fix than a behavioural
+      change.
+      [Geoff Thorpe, diagnosed by Nadav Har'El]
+ 
+   *) Don't impose a 16-byte length minimum on session IDs in ssl/s3_clnt.c
+      (the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 specifications allow any length up to 32 bytes).
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Fix initialization code race conditions in
+         SSLv23_method(),  SSLv23_client_method(),   SSLv23_server_method(),
+         SSLv2_method(),   SSLv2_client_method(),    SSLv2_server_method(),
+         SSLv3_method(),   SSLv3_client_method(),    SSLv3_server_method(),
+         TLSv1_method(),   TLSv1_client_method(),    TLSv1_server_method(),
+         ssl2_get_cipher_by_char(),
+         ssl3_get_cipher_by_char().
+      [Patrick McCormick <patrick@tellme.com>, Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Reorder cleanup sequence in SSL_CTX_free(): only remove the ex_data after
+      the cached sessions are flushed, as the remove_cb() might use ex_data
+      contents. Bug found by Sam Varshavchik <mrsam@courier-mta.com>
+      (see [openssl.org #212]).
+      [Geoff Thorpe, Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix typo in OBJ_txt2obj which incorrectly passed the content
+      length, instead of the encoding length to d2i_ASN1_OBJECT.
+      [Steve Henson]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6f and 0.9.6g  [9 Aug 2002]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6g-engine release:]
+      Fix crypto/engine/vendor_defns/cswift.h for WIN32 (use '_stdcall').
+      [Lynn Gazis <lgazis@rainbow.com>]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6e and 0.9.6f  [8 Aug 2002]
+ 
+   *) Fix ASN1 checks. Check for overflow by comparing with LONG_MAX
+      and get fix the header length calculation.
+      [Florian Weimer <Weimer@CERT.Uni-Stuttgart.DE>,
+ 	Alon Kantor <alonk@checkpoint.com> (and others),
+ 	Steve Henson]
+ 
+   *) Use proper error handling instead of 'assertions' in buffer
+      overflow checks added in 0.9.6e.  This prevents DoS (the
+      assertions could call abort()).
+      [Arne Ansper <arne@ats.cyber.ee>, Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6d and 0.9.6e  [30 Jul 2002]
+ 
+   *) Add various sanity checks to asn1_get_length() to reject
+      the ASN1 length bytes if they exceed sizeof(long), will appear
+      negative or the content length exceeds the length of the
+      supplied buffer.
+      [Steve Henson, Adi Stav <stav@mercury.co.il>, James Yonan <jim@ntlp.com>]
+ 
+   *) Fix cipher selection routines: ciphers without encryption had no flags
+      for the cipher strength set and where therefore not handled correctly
+      by the selection routines (PR #130).
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix EVP_dsa_sha macro.
+      [Nils Larsch]
+ 
+   *) New option
+           SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
+      for disabling the SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability countermeasure
+      that was added in OpenSSL 0.9.6d.
+ 
+      As the countermeasure turned out to be incompatible with some
+      broken SSL implementations, the new option is part of SSL_OP_ALL.
+      SSL_OP_ALL is usually employed when compatibility with weird SSL
+      implementations is desired (e.g. '-bugs' option to 's_client' and
+      's_server'), so the new option is automatically set in many
+      applications.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Changes in security patch:
+ 
+      Changes marked "(CHATS)" were sponsored by the Defense Advanced
+      Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force Research Laboratory,
+      Air Force Materiel Command, USAF, under agreement number
+      F30602-01-2-0537.
+ 
+   *) Add various sanity checks to asn1_get_length() to reject
+      the ASN1 length bytes if they exceed sizeof(long), will appear
+      negative or the content length exceeds the length of the
+      supplied buffer. (CAN-2002-0659)
+      [Steve Henson, Adi Stav <stav@mercury.co.il>, James Yonan <jim@ntlp.com>]
+ 
+   *) Assertions for various potential buffer overflows, not known to
+      happen in practice.
+      [Ben Laurie (CHATS)]
+ 
+   *) Various temporary buffers to hold ASCII versions of integers were
+      too small for 64 bit platforms. (CAN-2002-0655)
+      [Matthew Byng-Maddick <mbm@aldigital.co.uk> and Ben Laurie (CHATS)>
+ 
+   *) Remote buffer overflow in SSL3 protocol - an attacker could
+      supply an oversized session ID to a client. (CAN-2002-0656)
+      [Ben Laurie (CHATS)]
+ 
+   *) Remote buffer overflow in SSL2 protocol - an attacker could
+      supply an oversized client master key. (CAN-2002-0656)
+      [Ben Laurie (CHATS)]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6c and 0.9.6d  [9 May 2002]
+ 
+   *) Fix crypto/asn1/a_sign.c so that 'parameters' is omitted (not
+      encoded as NULL) with id-dsa-with-sha1.
+      [Nils Larsch <nla@trustcenter.de>; problem pointed out by Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Check various X509_...() return values in apps/req.c.
+      [Nils Larsch <nla@trustcenter.de>]
+ 
+   *) Fix BASE64 decode (EVP_DecodeUpdate) for data with CR/LF ended lines:
+      an end-of-file condition would erronously be flagged, when the CRLF
+      was just at the end of a processed block. The bug was discovered when
+      processing data through a buffering memory BIO handing the data to a
+      BASE64-decoding BIO. Bug fund and patch submitted by Pavel Tsekov
+      <ptsekov@syntrex.com> and Nedelcho Stanev.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Implement a countermeasure against a vulnerability recently found
+      in CBC ciphersuites in SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0: Send an empty fragment
+      before application data chunks to avoid the use of known IVs
+      with data potentially chosen by the attacker.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Fix length checks in ssl3_get_client_hello().
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) TLS/SSL library bugfix: use s->s3->in_read_app_data differently
+      to prevent ssl3_read_internal() from incorrectly assuming that
+      ssl3_read_bytes() found application data while handshake
+      processing was enabled when in fact s->s3->in_read_app_data was
+      merely automatically cleared during the initial handshake.
+      [Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Arne Ansper <arne@ats.cyber.ee>]
+ 
+   *) Fix object definitions for Private and Enterprise: they were not
+      recognized in their shortname (=lowercase) representation. Extend
+      obj_dat.pl to issue an error when using undefined keywords instead
+      of silently ignoring the problem (Svenning Sorensen
+      <sss@sss.dnsalias.net>).
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix DH_generate_parameters() so that it works for 'non-standard'
+      generators, i.e. generators other than 2 and 5.  (Previously, the
+      code did not properly initialise the 'add' and 'rem' values to
+      BN_generate_prime().)
+ 
+      In the new general case, we do not insist that 'generator' is
+      actually a primitive root: This requirement is rather pointless;
+      a generator of the order-q subgroup is just as good, if not
+      better.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+  
+   *) Map new X509 verification errors to alerts. Discovered and submitted by
+      Tom Wu <tom@arcot.com>.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix ssl3_pending() (ssl/s3_lib.c) to prevent SSL_pending() from
+      returning non-zero before the data has been completely received
+      when using non-blocking I/O.
+      [Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by John Hughes]
+ 
+   *) Some of the ciphers missed the strength entry (SSL_LOW etc).
+      [Ben Laurie, Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix bug in SSL_clear(): bad sessions were not removed (found by
+      Yoram Zahavi <YoramZ@gilian.com>).
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Add information about CygWin 1.3 and on, and preserve proper
+      configuration for the versions before that.
+      [Corinna Vinschen <vinschen@redhat.com> and Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Make removal from session cache (SSL_CTX_remove_session()) more robust:
+      check whether we deal with a copy of a session and do not delete from
+      the cache in this case. Problem reported by "Izhar Shoshani Levi"
+      <izhar@checkpoint.com>.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Do not store session data into the internal session cache, if it
+      is never intended to be looked up (SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP
+      flag is set). Proposed by Aslam <aslam@funk.com>.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Have ASN1_BIT_STRING_set_bit() really clear a bit when the requested
+      value is 0.
+      [Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6d-engine release:]
+      Fix a crashbug and a logic bug in hwcrhk_load_pubkey().
+      [Toomas Kiisk <vix@cyber.ee> via Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Add the configuration target linux-s390x.
+      [Neale Ferguson <Neale.Ferguson@SoftwareAG-USA.com> via Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) The earlier bugfix for the SSL3_ST_SW_HELLO_REQ_C case of
+      ssl3_accept (ssl/s3_srvr.c) incorrectly used a local flag
+      variable as an indication that a ClientHello message has been
+      received.  As the flag value will be lost between multiple
+      invocations of ssl3_accept when using non-blocking I/O, the
+      function may not be aware that a handshake has actually taken
+      place, thus preventing a new session from being added to the
+      session cache.
+ 
+      To avoid this problem, we now set s->new_session to 2 instead of
+      using a local variable.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke, Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Bugfix: Return -1 from ssl3_get_server_done (ssl3/s3_clnt.c)
+      if the SSL_R_LENGTH_MISMATCH error is detected.
+      [Geoff Thorpe, Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) New 'shared_ldflag' column in Configure platform table.
+      [Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) Fix EVP_CIPHER_mode macro.
+      ["Dan S. Camper" <dan@bti.net>]
+ 
+   *) Fix ssl3_read_bytes (ssl/s3_pkt.c): To ignore messages of unknown
+      type, we must throw them away by setting rr->length to 0.
+      [D P Chang <dpc@qualys.com>]
+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6b and 0.9.6c  [21 dec 2001]
+ 
+   *) Fix BN_rand_range bug pointed out by Dominikus Scherkl
+      <Dominikus.Scherkl@biodata.com>.  (The previous implementation
+      worked incorrectly for those cases where  range = 10..._2  and
+      3*range  is two bits longer than  range.)
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Only add signing time to PKCS7 structures if it is not already
+      present.
+      [Steve Henson]
+ 
+   *) Fix crypto/objects/objects.h: "ld-ce" should be "id-ce",
+      OBJ_ld_ce should be OBJ_id_ce.
+      Also some ip-pda OIDs in crypto/objects/objects.txt were
+      incorrect (cf. RFC 3039).
+      [Matt Cooper, Frederic Giudicelli, Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Release CRYPTO_LOCK_DYNLOCK when CRYPTO_destroy_dynlockid()
+      returns early because it has nothing to do.
+      [Andy Schneider <andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk>]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
+      Fix mutex callback return values in crypto/engine/hw_ncipher.c.
+      [Andy Schneider <andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk>]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
+      Add support for Cryptographic Appliance's keyserver technology.
+      (Use engine 'keyclient')
+      [Cryptographic Appliances and Geoff Thorpe]
+ 
+   *) Add a configuration entry for OS/390 Unix.  The C compiler 'c89'
+      is called via tools/c89.sh because arguments have to be
+      rearranged (all '-L' options must appear before the first object
+      modules).
+      [Richard Shapiro <rshapiro@abinitio.com>]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
+      Add support for Broadcom crypto accelerator cards, backported
+      from 0.9.7.
+      [Broadcom, Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>, Mark Cox]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
+      Add support for SureWare crypto accelerator cards from 
+      Baltimore Technologies.  (Use engine 'sureware')
+      [Baltimore Technologies and Mark Cox]
+ 
+   *) [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
+      Add support for crypto accelerator cards from Accelerated
+      Encryption Processing, www.aep.ie.  (Use engine 'aep')
+      [AEP Inc. and Mark Cox]
+ 
+   *) Add a configuration entry for gcc on UnixWare.
+      [Gary Benson <gbenson@redhat.com>]
+ 
+   *) Change ssl/s2_clnt.c and ssl/s2_srvr.c so that received handshake
+      messages are stored in a single piece (fixed-length part and
+      variable-length part combined) and fix various bugs found on the way.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Disable caching in BIO_gethostbyname(), directly use gethostbyname()
+      instead.  BIO_gethostbyname() does not know what timeouts are
+      appropriate, so entries would stay in cache even when they have
+      become invalid.
+      [Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Rich Salz <rsalz@zolera.com>
+ 
+   *) Change ssl23_get_client_hello (ssl/s23_srvr.c) behaviour when
+      faced with a pathologically small ClientHello fragment that does
+      not contain client_version: Instead of aborting with an error,
+      simply choose the highest available protocol version (i.e.,
+      TLS 1.0 unless it is disabled).  In practice, ClientHello
+      messages are never sent like this, but this change gives us
+      strictly correct behaviour at least for TLS.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Fix SSL handshake functions and SSL_clear() such that SSL_clear()
+      never resets s->method to s->ctx->method when called from within
+      one of the SSL handshake functions.
+      [Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Niko Baric]
+ 
+   *) In ssl3_get_client_hello (ssl/s3_srvr.c), generate a fatal alert
+      (sent using the client's version number) if client_version is
+      smaller than the protocol version in use.  Also change
+      ssl23_get_client_hello (ssl/s23_srvr.c) to select TLS 1.0 if
+      the client demanded SSL 3.0 but only TLS 1.0 is enabled; then
+      the client will at least see that alert.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Fix ssl3_get_message (ssl/s3_both.c) to handle message fragmentation
+      correctly.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Avoid infinite loop in ssl3_get_message (ssl/s3_both.c) if a
+      client receives HelloRequest while in a handshake.
+      [Bodo Moeller; bug noticed by Andy Schneider <andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk>]
+ 
+   *) Bugfix in ssl3_accept (ssl/s3_srvr.c): Case SSL3_ST_SW_HELLO_REQ_C
+      should end in 'break', not 'goto end' which circuments various
+      cleanups done in state SSL_ST_OK.   But session related stuff
+      must be disabled for SSL_ST_OK in the case that we just sent a
+      HelloRequest.
+ 
+      Also avoid some overhead by not calling ssl_init_wbio_buffer()
+      before just sending a HelloRequest.
+      [Bodo Moeller, Eric Rescorla <ekr@rtfm.com>]
+ 
+   *) Fix ssl/s3_enc.c, ssl/t1_enc.c and ssl/s3_pkt.c so that we don't
+      reveal whether illegal block cipher padding was found or a MAC
+      verification error occured.  (Neither SSLerr() codes nor alerts
+      are directly visible to potential attackers, but the information
+      may leak via logfiles.)
+ 
+      Similar changes are not required for the SSL 2.0 implementation
+      because the number of padding bytes is sent in clear for SSL 2.0,
+      and the extra bytes are just ignored.  However ssl/s2_pkt.c
+      failed to verify that the purported number of padding bytes is in
+      the legal range.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Add OpenUNIX-8 support including shared libraries
+      (Boyd Lynn Gerber <gerberb@zenez.com>).
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Improve RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_OAEP() check again to avoid
+      'wristwatch attack' using huge encoding parameters (cf.
+      James H. Manger's CRYPTO 2001 paper).  Note that the
+      RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING case of RSA_private_decrypt() does not use
+      encoding parameters and hence was not vulnerable.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) BN_sqr() bug fix.
+      [Ulf Möller, reported by Jim Ellis <jim.ellis@cavium.com>]
+ 
+   *) Rabin-Miller test analyses assume uniformly distributed witnesses,
+      so use BN_pseudo_rand_range() instead of using BN_pseudo_rand()
+      followed by modular reduction.
+      [Bodo Moeller; pointed out by Adam Young <AYoung1@NCSUS.JNJ.COM>]
+ 
+   *) Add BN_pseudo_rand_range() with obvious functionality: BN_rand_range()
+      equivalent based on BN_pseudo_rand() instead of BN_rand().
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) s3_srvr.c: allow sending of large client certificate lists (> 16 kB).
+      This function was broken, as the check for a new client hello message
+      to handle SGC did not allow these large messages.
+      (Tracked down by "Douglas E. Engert" <deengert@anl.gov>.)
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Add alert descriptions for TLSv1 to SSL_alert_desc_string[_long]().
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Fix buggy behaviour of BIO_get_num_renegotiates() and BIO_ctrl()
+      for BIO_C_GET_WRITE_BUF_SIZE ("Stephen Hinton" <shinton@netopia.com>).
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Rework the configuration and shared library support for Tru64 Unix.
+      The configuration part makes use of modern compiler features and
+      still retains old compiler behavior for those that run older versions
+      of the OS.  The shared library support part includes a variant that
+      uses the RPATH feature, and is available through the special
+      configuration target "alpha-cc-rpath", which will never be selected
+      automatically.
+      [Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu> via Richard Levitte]
+ 
+   *) In ssl3_get_key_exchange (ssl/s3_clnt.c), call ssl3_get_message()
+      with the same message size as in ssl3_get_certificate_request().
+      Otherwise, if no ServerKeyExchange message occurs, CertificateRequest
+      messages might inadvertently be reject as too long.
+      [Petr Lampa <lampa@fee.vutbr.cz>]
+ 
+   *) Enhanced support for IA-64 Unix platforms (well, Linux and HP-UX).
+      [Andy Polyakov]
+ 
+   *) Modified SSL library such that the verify_callback that has been set
+      specificly for an SSL object with SSL_set_verify() is actually being
+      used. Before the change, a verify_callback set with this function was
+      ignored and the verify_callback() set in the SSL_CTX at the time of
+      the call was used. New function X509_STORE_CTX_set_verify_cb() introduced
+      to allow the necessary settings.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) Initialize static variable in crypto/dsa/dsa_lib.c and crypto/dh/dh_lib.c
+      explicitly to NULL, as at least on Solaris 8 this seems not always to be
+      done automatically (in contradiction to the requirements of the C
+      standard). This made problems when used from OpenSSH.
+      [Lutz Jaenicke]
+ 
+   *) In OpenSSL 0.9.6a and 0.9.6b, crypto/dh/dh_key.c ignored
+      dh->length and always used
+ 
+           BN_rand_range(priv_key, dh->p).
+ 
+      BN_rand_range() is not necessary for Diffie-Hellman, and this
+      specific range makes Diffie-Hellman unnecessarily inefficient if
+      dh->length (recommended exponent length) is much smaller than the
+      length of dh->p.  We could use BN_rand_range() if the order of
+      the subgroup was stored in the DH structure, but we only have
+      dh->length.
+ 
+      So switch back to
+ 
+           BN_rand(priv_key, l, ...)
+ 
+      where 'l' is dh->length if this is defined, or BN_num_bits(dh->p)-1
+      otherwise.

+   *) In crypto/rand/md_rand.c, use a new short-time lock CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2

+ 
+  Changes between 0.9.6a and 0.9.6b  [9 Jul 2001]
+ 
+   *) Change ssleay_rand_bytes (crypto/rand/md_rand.c)
+      to avoid a SSLeay/OpenSSL PRNG weakness pointed out by
+      Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen <markku-juhani.saarinen@nokia.com>:
+      PRNG state recovery was possible based on the output of
+      one PRNG request appropriately sized to gain knowledge on
+      'md' followed by enough consecutive 1-byte PRNG requests
+      to traverse all of 'state'.
+ 
+      1. When updating 'md_local' (the current thread's copy of 'md')
+         during PRNG output generation, hash all of the previous
+         'md_local' value, not just the half used for PRNG output.
+ 
+      2. Make the number of bytes from 'state' included into the hash
+         independent from the number of PRNG bytes requested.
+ 
+      The first measure alone would be sufficient to avoid
+      Markku-Juhani's attack.  (Actually it had never occurred
+      to me that the half of 'md_local' used for chaining was the
+      half from which PRNG output bytes were taken -- I had always
+      assumed that the secret half would be used.)  The second
+      measure makes sure that additional data from 'state' is never
+      mixed into 'md_local' in small portions; this heuristically
+      further strengthens the PRNG.

+ 
+   *) Fix OAEP check.
+      [Ulf Möller, Bodo Möller]
+ 
+   *) The countermeasure against Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5
+      RSA encryption was accidentally removed in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.5
+      when fixing the server behaviour for backwards-compatible 'client
+      hello' messages.  (Note that the attack is impractical against
+      SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 anyway because length and version checking
+      means that the probability of guessing a valid ciphertext is
+      around 2^-40; see section 5 in Bleichenbacher's CRYPTO '98
+      paper.)
+ 
+      Before 0.9.5, the countermeasure (hide the error by generating a
+      random 'decryption result') did not work properly because
+      ERR_clear_error() was missing, meaning that SSL_get_error() would
+      detect the supposedly ignored error.
+ 
+      Both problems are now fixed.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) In crypto/bio/bf_buff.c, increase DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE to 4096
+      (previously it was 1024).
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) Fix for compatibility mode trust settings: ignore trust settings

+ 
+   *) Fix various bugs related to DSA S/MIME verification. Handle missing
+      parameters in DSA public key structures and return an error in the
+      DSA routines if parameters are absent.
+      [Steve Henson]
+ 
+   *) In versions up to 0.9.6, RAND_file_name() resorted to file ".rnd"
+      in the current directory if neither $RANDFILE nor $HOME was set.
+      RAND_file_name() in 0.9.6a returned NULL in this case.  This has
+      caused some confusion to Windows users who haven't defined $HOME.
+      Thus RAND_file_name() is changed again: e_os.h can define a
+      DEFAULT_HOME, which will be used if $HOME is not set.
+      For Windows, we use "C:"; on other platforms, we still require
+      environment variables.
+ 
+   *) Move 'if (!initialized) RAND_poll()' into regions protected by
+      CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND.  This is not strictly necessary, but avoids
+      having multiple threads call RAND_poll() concurrently.
+      [Bodo Moeller]
+ 
+   *) In crypto/rand/md_rand.c, replace 'add_do_not_lock' flag by a
+      combination of a flag and a thread ID variable.
+      Otherwise while one thread is in ssleay_rand_bytes (which sets the
+      flag), *other* threads can enter ssleay_add_bytes without obeying
+      the CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND lock (and may even illegally release the lock
+      that they do not hold after the first thread unsets add_do_not_lock).
+      [Bodo Moeller]

+      versions of 'test'.

  autoconf will probably be used in future OpenSSL versions. If it was
  less Unix-centric, it might have been used much earlier.
  
+ * What is an 'engine' version?
+ 
+ With version 0.9.6 OpenSSL was extended to interface to external crypto
+ hardware. This was realized in a special release '0.9.6-engine'. With
+ version 0.9.7 (not yet released) the changes were merged into the main
+ development line, so that the special release is no longer necessary.
+ 
+ * How do I check the authenticity of the OpenSSL distribution?
+ 
+ We provide MD5 digests and ASC signatures of each tarball.
+ Use MD5 to check that a tarball from a mirror site is identical:
+ 
+    md5sum TARBALL | awk '{print $1;}' | cmp - TARBALL.md5
+ 
+ You can check authenticity using pgp or gpg. You need the OpenSSL team
+ member public key used to sign it (download it from a key server). Then
+ just do:
+ 
+    pgp TARBALL.asc

  Cryptographic software needs a source of unpredictable data to work
  correctly.  Many open source operating systems provide a "randomness
! device" that serves this purpose.  On other systems, applications have
! to call the RAND_add() or RAND_seed() function with appropriate data
! before generating keys or performing public key encryption.
! 
! Some broken applications do not do this.  As of version 0.9.5, the
! OpenSSL functions that need randomness report an error if the random
! number generator has not been seeded with at least 128 bits of
! randomness.  If this error occurs, please contact the author of the
! application you are using.  It is likely that it never worked
! correctly.  OpenSSL 0.9.5 and later make the error visible by refusing
! to perform potentially insecure encryption.
! 
! On systems without /dev/urandom, it is a good idea to use the Entropy
! Gathering Demon; see the RAND_egd() manpage for details.
! 
! Most components of the openssl command line tool try to use the
! file $HOME/.rnd (or $RANDFILE, if this environment variable is set)
! for seeding the PRNG.  If this file does not exist or is too short,
! the "PRNG not seeded" error message may occur.
! 
! [Note to OpenSSL 0.9.5 users: The command "openssl rsa" in version

! when trying to password-encrypt an RSA key!  This is a bug in the

  * How do I create certificates or certificate requests?
--- 184,256 ----
  
  Cryptographic software needs a source of unpredictable data to work
  correctly.  Many open source operating systems provide a "randomness
! device" (/dev/urandom or /dev/random) that serves this purpose.
! All OpenSSL versions try to use /dev/urandom by default; starting with
! version 0.9.7, OpenSSL also tries /dev/random if /dev/urandom is not
! available.
! 
! On other systems, applications have to call the RAND_add() or
! RAND_seed() function with appropriate data before generating keys or
! performing public key encryption. (These functions initialize the
! pseudo-random number generator, PRNG.)  Some broken applications do
! not do this.  As of version 0.9.5, the OpenSSL functions that need
! randomness report an error if the random number generator has not been
! seeded with at least 128 bits of randomness.  If this error occurs and
! is not discussed in the documentation of the application you are
! using, please contact the author of that application; it is likely
! that it never worked correctly.  OpenSSL 0.9.5 and later make the
! error visible by refusing to perform potentially insecure encryption.
! 
! If you are using Solaris 8, you can add /dev/urandom and /dev/random
! devices by installing patch 112438 (Sparc) or 112439 (x86), which are
! available via the Patchfinder at <URL: http://sunsolve.sun.com>
! (Solaris 9 includes these devices by default). For /dev/random support
! for earlier Solaris versions, see Sun's statement at
! <URL: http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsrdb/27606&zone_32=SUNWski>
! (the SUNWski package is available in patch 105710).
! 
! On systems without /dev/urandom and /dev/random, it is a good idea to
! use the Entropy Gathering Demon (EGD); see the RAND_egd() manpage for
! details.  Starting with version 0.9.7, OpenSSL will automatically look
! for an EGD socket at /var/run/egd-pool, /dev/egd-pool, /etc/egd-pool and
! /etc/entropy.
! 
! Most components of the openssl command line utility automatically try
! to seed the random number generator from a file.  The name of the
! default seeding file is determined as follows: If environment variable
! RANDFILE is set, then it names the seeding file.  Otherwise if
! environment variable HOME is set, then the seeding file is $HOME/.rnd.
! If neither RANDFILE nor HOME is set, versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.6 will
! use file .rnd in the current directory while OpenSSL 0.9.6a uses no
! default seeding file at all.  OpenSSL 0.9.6b and later will behave
! similarly to 0.9.6a, but will use a default of "C:\" for HOME on
! Windows systems if the environment variable has not been set.
! 
! If the default seeding file does not exist or is too short, the "PRNG
! not seeded" error message may occur.
! 
! The openssl command line utility will write back a new state to the
! default seeding file (and create this file if necessary) unless
! there was no sufficient seeding.
! 
! Pointing $RANDFILE to an Entropy Gathering Daemon socket does not work.
! Use the "-rand" option of the OpenSSL command line tools instead.
! The $RANDFILE environment variable and $HOME/.rnd are only used by the
! OpenSSL command line tools. Applications using the OpenSSL library
! provide their own configuration options to specify the entropy source,
! please check out the documentation coming the with application.
! 
! 
! * Why do I get an "unable to write 'random state'" error message?
! 
! 
! Sometimes the openssl command line utility does not abort with
! a "PRNG not seeded" error message, but complains that it is
! "unable to write 'random state'".  This message refers to the
! default seeding file (see previous answer).  A possible reason
! is that no default filename is known because neither RANDFILE
! nor HOME is set.  (Versions up to 0.9.6 used file ".rnd" in the
! current directory in this case, but this has changed with 0.9.6a.)

  The solution is to add the relevant CA certificate to your servers "trusted

+ The usual way is to send the DER encoded certificate to the browser as
+ MIME type application/x-x509-ca-cert, for example by clicking on an appropriate
+ link. On MSIE certain extensions such as .der or .cacert may also work, or you
+ can import the certificate using the certificate import wizard.
+ 
+ You can convert a certificate to DER form using the command:
+ 
+ openssl x509 -in ca.pem -outform DER -out ca.der
+ 
+ Occasionally someone suggests using a command such as:
+ 
+ openssl pkcs12 -export -out cacert.p12 -in cacert.pem -inkey cakey.pem
+ 
+ DO NOT DO THIS! This command will give away your CAs private key and
+ reduces its security to zero: allowing anyone to forge certificates in

  and the changes are only valid for the current DOS session.
  
  
+ * What is special about OpenSSL on Redhat?
+ 
+ Red Hat Linux (release 7.0 and later) include a preinstalled limited
+ version of OpenSSL. For patent reasons, support for IDEA, RC5 and MDC2
+ is disabled in this version. The same may apply to other Linux distributions.
+ Users may therefore wish to install more or all of the features left out.
+ 
+ To do this you MUST ensure that you do not overwrite the openssl that is in
+ /usr/bin on your Red Hat machine. Several packages depend on this file,
+ including sendmail and ssh. /usr/local/bin is a good alternative choice. The
+ libraries that come with Red Hat 7.0 onwards have different names and so are
+ not affected. (eg For Red Hat 7.2 they are /lib/libssl.so.0.9.6b and
+ /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6b with symlinks /lib/libssl.so.2 and
+ /lib/libcrypto.so.2 respectively).
+ 
+ Please note that we have been advised by Red Hat attempting to recompile the
+ openssl rpm with all the cryptography enabled will not work. All other
+ packages depend on the original Red Hat supplied openssl package. It is also
+ worth noting that due to the way Red Hat supplies its packages, updates to
+ openssl on each distribution never change the package version, only the
+ build number. For example, on Red Hat 7.1, the latest openssl package has
+ version number 0.9.6 and build number 9 even though it contains all the
+ relevant updates in packages up to and including 0.9.6b.
+ 
+ A possible way around this is to persuade Red Hat to produce a non-US
+ version of Red Hat Linux.
+ 
+ FYI: Patent numbers and expiry dates of US patents:
+ MDC-2: 4,908,861 13/03/2007
+ IDEA:  5,214,703 25/05/2010
+ RC5:   5,724,428 03/03/2015
+ 
+ 
+ * Why does the OpenSSL test suite fail on MacOS X?
+ 
+ If the failure happens when running 'make test' and the RC4 test fails,
+ it's very probable that you have OpenSSL 0.9.6b delivered with the
+ operating system (you can find out by running '/usr/bin/openssl version')
+ and that you were trying to build OpenSSL 0.9.6d.  The problem is that
+ the loader ('ld') in MacOS X has a misfeature that's quite difficult to
+ go around and has linked the programs "openssl" and the test programs
+ with /usr/lib/libcrypto.dylib and /usr/lib/libssl.dylib instead of the
+ libraries you just built.
+ Look in the file PROBLEMS for a more detailed explanation and for possible
+ solutions.

! Permissions might be wrong.

! The general answer is to check the config.log file generated when running

   Note on shared libraries
   ------------------------
  
+  Shared library is currently an experimental feature.  The only reason to
+  have them would be to conserve memory on systems where several program
+  are using OpenSSL.  Binary backward compatibility can't be guaranteed
+  before OpenSSL version 1.0.
+ 
   For some systems, the OpenSSL Configure script knows what is needed to
   build shared libraries for libcrypto and libssl.  On these systems,
   the shared libraries are currently not created by default, but giving
***************
*** 276,278 ****
--- 285,299 ----
   targets for shared library creation, like linux-shared.  Those targets
   can currently be used on their own just as well, but this is expected
   to change in future versions of OpenSSL.
+ 
+  Note on random number generation
+  --------------------------------
+ 
+  Availability of cryptographically secure random numbers is required for
+  secret key generation. OpenSSL provides several options to seed the
+  internal PRNG. If not properly seeded, the internal PRNG will refuse
+  to deliver random bytes and a "PRNG not seeded error" will occur.
+  On systems without /dev/urandom (or similar) device, it may be necessary
+  to install additional support software to obtain random seed.
+  Please check out the manual pages for RAND_add(), RAND_bytes(), RAND_egd(),
+  and the FAQ for more information.

-   AVAILABLE PATCHES

-     o CA.pl patch (Damien Miller)
- 
-   IN PROGRESS
- 
-     o Steve is currently working on (in no particular order):
-         ASN1 code redesign, butchery, replacement.
-         EVP cipher enhancement.
-         Proper (or at least usable) certificate chain verification.
- 	Private key, certificate and CRL API and implementation.
- 	Developing and bugfixing PKCS#7 (S/MIME code).
-         Various X509 issues: character sets, certificate request extensions.
-     o Geoff and Richard are currently working on:
- 	ENGINE (the new code that gives hardware support among others).
-     o Richard is currently working on:
- 	UTIL (a new set of library functions to support some higher level
- 	      functionality that is currently missing).
- 	Dynamic thread-lock support.
- 	Shared library support for VMS.
- 
-   NEEDS PATCH
- 
-     o  non-blocking socket on AIX
-     o  $(PERL) in */Makefile.ssl
-     o  "Sign the certificate?" - "n" creates empty certificate file
- 
-   OPEN ISSUES
- 
-     o internal_verify doesn't know about X509.v3 (basicConstraints
-       CA flag ...)
- 
-     o  The Makefile hierarchy and build mechanism is still not a round thing:
- 
-        1. The config vs. Configure scripts
-           It's the same nasty situation as for Apache with APACI vs.
-           src/Configure. It confuses.
-           Suggestion: Merge Configure and config into a single configure
-                       script with a Autoconf style interface ;-) and remove
-                       Configure and config. Or even let us use GNU Autoconf
-                       itself. Then we can avoid a lot of those platform checks
-                       which are currently in Configure.
- 
-     o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
-        for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
-        Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
-        solution to be really simple.
- 
-        Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
-                compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
-                into the OpenSSL Configure script.
- 
-                Ulf: +1 for using GNU autoconf and libtool (but not automake,
-                     which apparently is not flexible enough to generate
-                     libcrypto)
- 
- 
-     o  The perl/ stuff needs a major overhaul. Currently it's
-        totally obsolete. Either we clean it up and enhance it to be up-to-date
-        with the C code or we also could replace it with the really nice
-        Net::SSLeay package we can find under
-        http://www.neuronio.pt/SSLeay.pm.html.  Ralf uses this package for a
-        longer time and it works fine and is a nice Perl module. Best would be
-        to convince the author to work for the OpenSSL project and create a
-        Net::OpenSSL or Crypt::OpenSSL package out of it and maintains it for
-        us.
- 
-        Status: Ralf thinks we should both contact the author of Net::SSLeay
-                and look how much effort it is to bring Eric's perl/ stuff up
-                to date.

*** 1,84 ****
- Modes of DES
- Quite a bit of the following information has been taken from
- 	AS 2805.5.2
- 	Australian Standard
- 	Electronic funds transfer - Requirements for interfaces,
- 	Part 5.2: Modes of operation for an n-bit block cipher algorithm
- 	Appendix A
- 
- There are several different modes in which DES can be used, they are
- as follows.
- 
- Electronic Codebook Mode (ECB) (des_ecb_encrypt())
- - 64 bits are enciphered at a time.
- - The order of the blocks can be rearranged without detection.
- - The same plaintext block always produces the same ciphertext block
-   (for the same key) making it vulnerable to a 'dictionary attack'.
- - An error will only affect one ciphertext block.
- 
- Cipher Block Chaining Mode (CBC) (des_cbc_encrypt())
- - a multiple of 64 bits are enciphered at a time.
- - The CBC mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same
-   plaintext is encrypted using the same key and starting variable.
- - The chaining operation makes the ciphertext blocks dependent on the
-   current and all preceding plaintext blocks and therefore blocks can not
-   be rearranged.
- - The use of different starting variables prevents the same plaintext
-   enciphering to the same ciphertext.
- - An error will affect the current and the following ciphertext blocks.
- 
- Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) (des_cfb_encrypt())
- - a number of bits (j) <= 64 are enciphered at a time.
- - The CFB mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same
-   plaintext is encrypted using the same key and starting variable.
- - The chaining operation makes the ciphertext variables dependent on the
-   current and all preceding variables and therefore j-bit variables are
-   chained together and con not be rearranged.
- - The use of different starting variables prevents the same plaintext
-   enciphering to the same ciphertext.
- - The strength of the CFB mode depends on the size of k (maximal if
-   j == k).  In my implementation this is always the case.
- - Selection of a small value for j will require more cycles through
-   the encipherment algorithm per unit of plaintext and thus cause
-   greater processing overheads.
- - Only multiples of j bits can be enciphered.
- - An error will affect the current and the following ciphertext variables.
- 
- Output Feedback Mode (OFB) (des_ofb_encrypt())
- - a number of bits (j) <= 64 are enciphered at a time.
- - The OFB mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same
-   plaintext enciphered using the same key and starting variable.  More
-   over, in the OFB mode the same key stream is produced when the same
-   key and start variable are used.  Consequently, for security reasons
-   a specific start variable should be used only once for a given key.
- - The absence of chaining makes the OFB more vulnerable to specific attacks.
- - The use of different start variables values prevents the same
-   plaintext enciphering to the same ciphertext, by producing different
-   key streams.
- - Selection of a small value for j will require more cycles through
-   the encipherment algorithm per unit of plaintext and thus cause
-   greater processing overheads.
- - Only multiples of j bits can be enciphered.
- - OFB mode of operation does not extend ciphertext errors in the
-   resultant plaintext output.  Every bit error in the ciphertext causes
-   only one bit to be in error in the deciphered plaintext.
- - OFB mode is not self-synchronising.  If the two operation of
-   encipherment and decipherment get out of synchronism, the system needs
-   to be re-initialised.
- - Each re-initialisation should use a value of the start variable
- different from the start variable values used before with the same
- key.  The reason for this is that an identical bit stream would be
- produced each time from the same parameters.  This would be
- susceptible to a 'known plaintext' attack.
- 
- Triple ECB Mode (des_ecb3_encrypt())
- - Encrypt with key1, decrypt with key2 and encrypt with key1 again.
- - As for ECB encryption but increases the effective key length to 112 bits.
- - If both keys are the same it is equivalent to encrypting once with
-   just one key.
- 
- Triple CBC Mode (des_3cbc_encrypt())
- - Encrypt with key1, decrypt with key2 and encrypt with key1 again.
- - As for CBC encryption but increases the effective key length to 112 bits.
- - If both keys are the same it is equivalent to encrypting once with
-   just one key.

- .SH DESCRIPTION
- .B des
- encrypts and decrypts data using the
- Data Encryption Standard algorithm.
- One of
- .B \-e, \-E
- (for encrypt) or
- .B \-d, \-D
- (for decrypt) must be specified.
- It is also possible to use
- .B \-c
- or
- .B \-C
- in conjunction or instead of the a encrypt/decrypt option to generate
- a 16 character hexadecimal checksum, generated via the
- .I des_cbc_cksum.
- .LP
- Two standard encryption modes are supported by the
- .B des
- program, Cipher Block Chaining (the default) and Electronic Code Book
- (specified with
- .B \-b
- ).
- .LP
- The key used for the DES
- algorithm is obtained by prompting the user unless the
- .B `\-k
- .I key'
- option is given.
- If the key is an argument to the
- .B des
- command, it is potentially visible to users executing
- .BR ps (1)
- or a derivative.  To minimise this possibility,
- .B des
- takes care to destroy the key argument immediately upon entry.
- If your shell keeps a history file be careful to make sure it is not
- world readable.
- .LP
- Since this program attempts to maintain compatability with sunOS's
- des(1) command, there are 2 different methods used to convert the user
- supplied key to a des key.
- Whenever and one or more of
- .B \-E, \-D, \-C
- or
- .B \-3
- options are used, the key conversion procedure will not be compatible
- with the sunOS des(1) version but will use all the user supplied
- character to generate the des key.
- .B des
- command reads from standard input unless
- .I input-file
- is specified and writes to standard output unless
- .I output-file
- is given.
- .SH OPTIONS
- .TP
- .B \-b
- Select ECB
- (eight bytes at a time) encryption mode.
- .TP
- .B \-3
- Encrypt using triple encryption.
- By default triple cbc encryption is used but if the
- .B \-b
- option is used then triple ecb encryption is performed.
- If the key is less than 8 characters long, the flag has no effect.
- .TP
- .B \-e
- Encrypt data using an 8 byte key in a manner compatible with sunOS
- des(1).
- .TP
- .B \-E
- Encrypt data using a key of nearly unlimited length (1024 bytes).
- This will product a more secure encryption.
- .TP
- .B \-d
- Decrypt data that was encrypted with the \-e option.
- .TP
- .B \-D
- Decrypt data that was encrypted with the \-E option.
- .TP
- .B \-c
- Generate a 16 character hexadecimal cbc checksum and output this to
- stderr.
- If a filename was specified after the
- .B \-c
- option, the checksum is output to that file.
- The checksum is generated using a key generated in a sunOS compatible
- manner.
- .TP
- .B \-C
- A cbc checksum is generated in the same manner as described for the
- .B \-c
- option but the DES key is generated in the same manner as used for the
- .B \-E
- and
- .B \-D
- options
- .TP
- .B \-f
- Does nothing - allowed for compatibility with sunOS des(1) command.
- .TP
- .B \-s
- Does nothing - allowed for compatibility with sunOS des(1) command.
- .TP
- .B "\-k \fIkey\fP"
- Use the encryption 
- .I key
- specified.
- .TP
- .B "\-h"
- The
- .I key
- is assumed to be a 16 character hexadecimal number.
- If the
- .B "\-3"
- option is used the key is assumed to be a 32 character hexadecimal
- number.
- .TP
- .B \-u
- This flag is used to read and write uuencoded files.  If decrypting,
- the input file is assumed to contain uuencoded, DES encrypted data.
- If encrypting, the characters following the -u are used as the name of
- the uuencoded file to embed in the begin line of the uuencoded
- output.  If there is no name specified after the -u, the name text.des
- will be embedded in the header.
- .SH SEE ALSO
- .B ps (1)
- .B des_crypt(3)
- .SH BUGS
- .LP
- The problem with using the
- .B -e
- option is the short key length.
- It would be better to use a real 56-bit key rather than an
- ASCII-based 56-bit pattern.  Knowing that the key was derived from ASCII
- radically reduces the time necessary for a brute-force cryptographic attack.
- My attempt to remove this problem is to add an alternative text-key to
- DES-key function.  This alternative function (accessed via
- .B -E, -D, -S
- and
- .B -3
- )
- uses DES to help generate the key.
- .LP
- Be carefully when using the -u option.  Doing des -ud <filename> will
- not decrypt filename (the -u option will gobble the d option).
- .LP
- The VMS operating system operates in a world where files are always a
- multiple of 512 bytes.  This causes problems when encrypted data is
- send from unix to VMS since a 88 byte file will suddenly be padded
- with 424 null bytes.  To get around this problem, use the -u option
- to uuencode the data before it is send to the VMS system.

- # 11 April 1996 - patched to circumvent Perl 5 (through 5.002) problem
- #                 with sign-extension on right shift operations.

- # eay - 92/08/31 - I think I have fixed all problems for 64bit
- # versions of perl but I could be wrong since I have not tested it yet :-).
- #
- # This is an implementation of DES in perl.
- # The two routines (des_set_key and des_ecb_encrypt)
- # take 8 byte objects as arguments.
- #
- # des_set_key takes an 8 byte string as a key and returns a key schedule
- # for use in calls to des_ecb_encrypt.
- # des_ecb_encrypt takes three arguments, the first is a key schedule
- # (make sure to pass it by reference with the *), the second is 1
- # to encrypt, 0 to decrypt.  The third argument is an 8 byte object
- # to encrypt.  The function returns an 8 byte object that has been
- # DES encrypted.
- #
- # example:
- # require 'des.pl'
- #
- # $key =pack("C8",0x12,0x23,0x45,0x67,0x89,0xab,0xcd,0xef);
- # @ks=  &des_set_key($key);
- #
- # $outbytes= &des_ecb_encrypt(*ks,1,$data);
- # @enc =unpack("C8",$outbytes);
- #
-

- .SH DESCRIPTION
- This library contains a fast implementation of the DES encryption
- algorithm.
- .PP
- There are two phases to the use of DES encryption.
- The first is the generation of a
- .I des_key_schedule
- from a key,
- the second is the actual encryption.
- A des key is of type
- .I des_cblock.
- This type is made from 8 characters with odd parity.
- The least significant bit in the character is the parity bit.
- The key schedule is an expanded form of the key; it is used to speed the
- encryption process.
- .PP
- .I des_read_password
- writes the string specified by prompt to the standard output,
- turns off echo and reads an input string from standard input
- until terminated with a newline.
- If verify is non-zero, it prompts and reads the input again and verifies
- that both entered passwords are the same.
- The entered string is converted into a des key by using the
- .I des_string_to_key
- routine.
- The new key is placed in the
- .I des_cblock
- that was passed (by reference) to the routine.
- If there were no errors,
- .I des_read_password
- returns 0,
- -1 is returned if there was a terminal error and 1 is returned for
- any other error.
- .PP
- .I des_read_2password
- operates in the same way as
- .I des_read_password
- except that it generates 2 keys by using the
- .I des_string_to_2key
- function.
- .PP
- .I des_read_pw_string
- is called by
- .I des_read_password
- to read and verify a string from a terminal device.
- The string is returned in
- .I buf.
- The size of
- .I buf
- is passed to the routine via the
- .I length
- parameter.
- .PP
- .I des_string_to_key
- converts a string into a valid des key.
- .PP
- .I des_string_to_2key
- converts a string into 2 valid des keys.
- This routine is best suited for used to generate keys for use with
- .I des_ecb3_encrypt.
- .PP
- .I des_random_key
- returns a random key that is made of a combination of process id,
- time and an increasing counter.
- .PP
- Before a des key can be used it is converted into a
- .I des_key_schedule
- via the
- .I des_set_key
- routine.
- If the
- .I des_check_key
- flag is non-zero,
- .I des_set_key
- will check that the key passed is of odd parity and is not a week or
- semi-weak key.
- If the parity is wrong,
- then -1 is returned.
- If the key is a weak key,
- then -2 is returned.
- If an error is returned,
- the key schedule is not generated.
- .PP
- .I des_key_sched
- is another name for the
- .I des_set_key
- function.
- .PP
- The following routines mostly operate on an input and output stream of
- .I des_cblock's.
- .PP
- .I des_ecb_encrypt
- is the basic DES encryption routine that encrypts or decrypts a single 8-byte
- .I des_cblock
- in
- .I electronic code book
- mode.
- It always transforms the input data, pointed to by
- .I input,
- into the output data,
- pointed to by the
- .I output
- argument.
- If the
- .I encrypt
- argument is non-zero (DES_ENCRYPT),
- the
- .I input
- (cleartext) is encrypted in to the
- .I output
- (ciphertext) using the key_schedule specified by the
- .I schedule
- argument,
- previously set via
- .I des_set_key.
- If
- .I encrypt
- is zero (DES_DECRYPT),
- the
- .I input
- (now ciphertext)
- is decrypted into the
- .I output
- (now cleartext).
- Input and output may overlap.
- No meaningful value is returned.
- .PP
- .I des_ecb3_encrypt
- encrypts/decrypts the
- .I input
- block by using triple ecb DES encryption.
- This involves encrypting the input with 
- .I ks1,
- decryption with the key schedule
- .I ks2,
- and then encryption with the first again.
- This routine greatly reduces the chances of brute force breaking of
- DES and has the advantage of if
- .I ks1
- and
- .I ks2
- are the same, it is equivalent to just encryption using ecb mode and
- .I ks1
- as the key.
- .PP
- .I des_cbc_encrypt
- encrypts/decrypts using the
- .I cipher-block-chaining
- mode of DES.
- If the
- .I encrypt
- argument is non-zero,
- the routine cipher-block-chain encrypts the cleartext data pointed to by the
- .I input
- argument into the ciphertext pointed to by the
- .I output
- argument,
- using the key schedule provided by the
- .I schedule
- argument,
- and initialisation vector provided by the
- .I ivec
- argument.
- If the
- .I length
- argument is not an integral multiple of eight bytes, 
- the last block is copied to a temporary area and zero filled.
- The output is always
- an integral multiple of eight bytes.
- To make multiple cbc encrypt calls on a large amount of data appear to
- be one 
- .I des_cbc_encrypt
- call, the
- .I ivec
- of subsequent calls should be the last 8 bytes of the output.
- .PP
- .I des_3cbc_encrypt
- encrypts/decrypts the
- .I input
- block by using triple cbc DES encryption.
- This involves encrypting the input with key schedule
- .I ks1,
- decryption with the key schedule
- .I ks2,
- and then encryption with the first again.
- 2 initialisation vectors are required,
- .I ivec1
- and
- .I ivec2.
- Unlike
- .I des_cbc_encrypt,
- these initialisation vectors are modified by the subroutine.
- This routine greatly reduces the chances of brute force breaking of
- DES and has the advantage of if
- .I ks1
- and
- .I ks2
- are the same, it is equivalent to just encryption using cbc mode and
- .I ks1
- as the key.
- .PP
- .I des_pcbc_encrypt
- encrypt/decrypts using a modified block chaining mode.
- It provides better error propagation characteristics than cbc
- encryption.
- .PP
- .I des_cfb_encrypt
- encrypt/decrypts using cipher feedback mode.  This method takes an
- array of characters as input and outputs and array of characters.  It
- does not require any padding to 8 character groups.  Note: the ivec
- variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to
- the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete
- DES ecb encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for
- use when sending small numbers of characters.
- .PP
- .I des_ofb_encrypt
- encrypt using output feedback mode.  This method takes an
- array of characters as input and outputs and array of characters.  It
- does not require any padding to 8 character groups.  Note: the ivec
- variable is changed and the new changed value needs to be passed to
- the next call to this function.  Since this function runs a complete
- DES ecb encryption per numbits, this function is only suggested for
- use when sending small numbers of characters.
- .PP
- .I des_cbc_cksum
- produces an 8 byte checksum based on the input stream (via cbc encryption).
- The last 4 bytes of the checksum is returned and the complete 8 bytes is
- placed in
- .I output.
- .PP
- .I des_quad_cksum
- returns a 4 byte checksum from the input bytes.
- The algorithm can be iterated over the input,
- depending on
- .I out_count,
- 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.
- If
- .I output
- is non-NULL,
- the 8 bytes generated by each pass are written into
- .I output.
- .PP
- .I des_enc_write
- is used to write
- .I len
- bytes
- to file descriptor
- .I fd
- from buffer
- .I buf.
- The data is encrypted via
- .I pcbc_encrypt
- (default) using
- .I sched
- for the key and
- .I iv
- as a starting vector.
- The actual data send down
- .I fd
- consists of 4 bytes (in network byte order) containing the length of the
- following encrypted data.  The encrypted data then follows, padded with random
- data out to a multiple of 8 bytes.
- .PP
- .I des_enc_read
- is used to read
- .I len
- bytes
- from file descriptor
- .I fd
- into buffer
- .I buf.
- The data being read from
- .I fd
- is assumed to have come from
- .I des_enc_write
- and is decrypted using
- .I sched
- for the key schedule and
- .I iv
- for the initial vector.
- The
- .I des_enc_read/des_enc_write
- pair can be used to read/write to files, pipes and sockets.
- I have used them in implementing a version of rlogin in which all
- data is encrypted.
- .PP
- .I des_rw_mode
- is used to specify the encryption mode to use with 
- .I des_enc_read
- and 
- .I des_end_write.
- If set to
- .I DES_PCBC_MODE
- (the default), des_pcbc_encrypt is used.
- If set to
- .I DES_CBC_MODE
- des_cbc_encrypt is used.
- These two routines and the variable are not part of the normal MIT library.
- .PP
- .I des_set_odd_parity
- sets the parity of the passed
- .I key
- to odd.  This routine is not part of the standard MIT library.
- .PP
- .I des_is_weak_key
- returns 1 is the passed key is a weak key (pick again :-),
- 0 if it is ok.
- This routine is not part of the standard MIT library.
- .PP
- .I crypt
- is a replacement for the normal system crypt.
- It is much faster than the system crypt.
- .PP
- .SH FILES
- /usr/include/openssl/des.h
- .br
- /usr/lib/libcrypto.a
- .PP
- The encryption routines have been tested on 16bit, 32bit and 64bit
- machines of various endian and even works under VMS.
- .PP
- .SH BUGS
- .PP
- If you think this manual is sparse,
- read the des_crypt(3) manual from the MIT kerberos (or bones outside
- of the USA) distribution.
- .PP
- .I des_cfb_encrypt
- and
- .I des_ofb_encrypt
- operates on input of 8 bits.  What this means is that if you set
- numbits to 12, and length to 2, the first 12 bits will come from the 1st
- input byte and the low half of the second input byte.  The second 12
- bits will have the low 8 bits taken from the 3rd input byte and the
- top 4 bits taken from the 4th input byte.  The same holds for output.
- This function has been implemented this way because most people will
- be using a multiple of 8 and because once you get into pulling bytes input
- bytes apart things get ugly!
- .PP
- .I des_read_pw_string
- is the most machine/OS dependent function and normally generates the
- most problems when porting this code.
- .PP
- .I des_string_to_key
- is probably different from the MIT version since there are lots
- of fun ways to implement one-way encryption of a text string.
- .PP
- The routines are optimised for 32 bit machines and so are not efficient
- on IBM PCs.
- .PP
- NOTE: extensive work has been done on this library since this document
- was origionally written.  Please try to read des.doc from the libdes
- distribution since it is far more upto date and documents more of the
- functions.  Libdes is now also being shipped as part of SSLeay, a
- general cryptographic library that amonst other things implements
- netscapes SSL protocoll.  The most recent version can be found in
- SSLeay distributions.

- 
- OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL
- v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and related
- cryptography standards required by them.
- 
- The B<openssl> program is a command line tool for using the various
- cryptography functions of OpenSSL's B<crypto> library from the shell. 
- It can be used for 
- 
-  o  Creation of RSA, DH and DSA key parameters
-  o  Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs 
-  o  Calculation of Message Digests
-  o  Encryption and Decryption with Ciphers
-  o  SSL/TLS Client and Server Tests
-

+ 
+ SSL_COMP_add_compression_method - handle SSL/TLS integrated compression methods
+ 
+ =head1 SYNOPSIS
+ 
+  #include <openssl/ssl.h>
+ 
+  int SSL_COMP_add_compression_method(int id, COMP_METHOD *cm);
+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() adds the compression method B<cm> with
+ the identifier B<id> to the list of available compression methods. This
+ list is globally maintained for all SSL operations within this application.
+ It cannot be set for specific SSL_CTX or SSL objects.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ The TLS standard (or SSLv3) allows the integration of compression methods
+ into the communication. The TLS RFC does however not specify compression
+ methods or their corresponding identifiers, so there is currently no compatible
+ way to integrate compression with unknown peers. It is therefore currently not
+ recommended to integrate compression into applications. Applications for
+ non-public use may agree on certain compression methods. Using different
+ compression methods with the same identifier will lead to connection failure.
+ 
+ An OpenSSL client speaking a protocol that allows compression (SSLv3, TLSv1)
+ will unconditionally send the list of all compression methods enabled with
+ SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() to the server during the handshake.
+ Unlike the mechanisms to set a cipher list, there is no method available to
+ restrict the list of compression method on a per connection basis.
+ 
+ An OpenSSL server will match the identifiers listed by a client against
+ its own compression methods and will unconditionally activate compression
+ when a matching identifier is found. There is no way to restrict the list
+ of compression methods supported on a per connection basis.
+ 
+ The OpenSSL library has the compression methods B<COMP_rle()> and (when
+ especially enabled during compilation) B<COMP_zlib()> available.
+ 
+ =head1 WARNINGS
+ 
+ Once the identities of the compression methods for the TLS protocol have
+ been standardized, the compression API will most likely be changed. Using
+ it in the current state is not recommended.
+ 
+ =head1 RETURN VALUES
+ 
+ SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() may return the following values:

+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_cert_store() sets/replaces the certificate verification storage
+ of B<ctx> to/with B<store>. If another X509_STORE object is currently
+ set in B<ctx>, it will be X509_STORE_free()ed.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_get_cert_store() returns a pointer to the current certificate
+ verification storage.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ In order to verify the certificates presented by the peer, trusted CA
+ certificates must be accessed. These CA certificates are made available
+ via lookup methods, handled inside the X509_STORE. From the X509_STORE
+ the X509_STORE_CTX used when verifying certificates is created.
+ 
+ Typically the trusted certificate store is handled indirectly via using
+ L<SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3)|SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3)>.
+ Using the SSL_CTX_set_cert_store() and SSL_CTX_get_cert_store() functions
+ it is possible to manipulate the X509_STORE object beyond the
+ L<SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3)|SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3)>
+ call.
+ 
+ Currently no detailed documentation on how to use the X509_STORE
+ object is available. Not all members of the X509_STORE are used when
+ the verification takes place. So will e.g. the verify_callback() be
+ overridden with the verify_callback() set via the
+ L<SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)|SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)> family of functions.
+ This document must therefore be updated when documentation about the
+ X509_STORE object and its handling becomes available.

+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() sets the verification callback function for
+ B<ctx>. SSL objects, that are created from B<ctx> inherit the setting valid at
+ the time, L<SSL_new(3)|SSL_new(3)> is called. B<arg> is currently ignored.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ Whenever a certificate is verified during a SSL/TLS handshake, a verification
+ function is called. If the application does not explicitly specify a
+ verification callback function, the built-in verification function is used.
+ If a verification callback B<callback> is specified via
+ SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(), the supplied callback function is called
+ instead. By setting B<callback> to NULL, the default behaviour is restored.
+ 
+ When the verification must be performed, B<callback> will be called with
+ the argument callback(X509_STORE_CTX *x509_store_ctx). The arguments B<arg>
+ that can be specified when setting B<callback> are currently ignored.
+ 
+ B<callback> should return 1 to indicate verification success and 0 to
+ indicate verification failure. If SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set and B<callback>
+ returns 0, the handshake will fail. As the verification procedure may
+ allow to continue the connection in case of failure (by always returning 1)
+ the verification result must be set in any case using the B<error>
+ member of B<x509_store_ctx>, so that the calling application will be informed
+ about the detailed result of the verification procedure! 
+ 
+ Within B<x509_store_ctx>, B<callback> has access to the B<verify_callback>
+ function set using L<SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)|SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)>.
+ 
+ =head1 WARNINGS
+ 
+ Do not mix the verification callback described in this function with the
+ B<verify_callback> function called during the verification process. The
+ latter is set using the L<SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)|SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)>
+ family of functions.
+ 
+ Providing a complete verification procedure including certificate purpose
+ settings etc is a complex task. The built-in procedure is quite powerful
+ and in most cases it should be sufficient to modify its behaviour using
+ the B<verify_callback> function.
+ 
+ =head1 BUGS
+ 
+ It is possible to specify arguments to be passed to the verification callback.
+ Currently they are however not passed but ignored.
+ 
+ The B<callback> function is not specified via a prototype, so that no
+ type checking takes place.

+ =head1 SYNOPSIS
+ 
+  #include <openssl/ssl.h>
+ 
+  void SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb(SSL_CTX *ctx, int (*client_cert_cb)(SSL *ssl, X509 **x509, EVP_PKEY **pkey));
+  int (*SSL_CTX_get_client_cert_cb(SSL_CTX *ctx))(SSL *ssl, X509 **x509, EVP_PKEY **pkey);
+  int (*client_cert_cb)(SSL *ssl, X509 **x509, EVP_PKEY **pkey);
+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb() sets the B<client_cert_cb()> callback, that is
+ called when a client certificate is requested by a server and no certificate
+ was yet set for the SSL object.
+ 
+ When B<client_cert_cb()> is NULL, no callback function is used.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_get_client_cert_cb() returns a pointer to the currently set callback
+ function.
+ 
+ client_cert_cb() is the application defined callback. If it wants to
+ set a certificate, a certificate/private key combination must be set
+ using the B<x509> and B<pkey> arguments and "1" must be returned. The
+ certificate will be installed into B<ssl>, see the NOTES and BUGS sections.
+ If no certificate should be set, "0" has to be returned and no certificate
+ will be sent. A negative return value will suspend the handshake and the
+ handshake function will return immediatly. L<SSL_get_error(3)|SSL_get_error(3)>
+ will return SSL_ERROR_WANT_X509_LOOKUP to indicate, that the handshake was
+ suspended. The next call to the handshake function will again lead to the call
+ of client_cert_cb(). It is the job of the client_cert_cb() to store information
+ about the state of the last call, if required to continue.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ During a handshake (or renegotiation) a server may request a certificate
+ from the client. A client certificate must only be sent, when the server
+ did send the request.
+ 
+ When a certificate was set using the
+ L<SSL_CTX_use_certificate(3)|SSL_CTX_use_certificate(3)> family of functions,
+ it will be sent to the server. The TLS standard requires that only a
+ certificate is sent, if it matches the list of acceptable CAs sent by the
+ server. This constraint is violated by the default behavior of the OpenSSL
+ library. Using the callback function it is possible to implement a proper
+ selection routine or to allow a user interaction to choose the certificate to
+ be sent.
+ 
+ If a callback function is defined and no certificate was yet defined for the
+ SSL object, the callback function will be called.
+ If the callback function returns a certificate, the OpenSSL library
+ will try to load the private key and certificate data into the SSL
+ object using the SSL_use_certificate() and SSL_use_private_key() functions.
+ Thus it will permanently install the certificate and key for this SSL
+ object. It will not be reset by calling L<SSL_clear(3)|SSL_clear(3)>.
+ If the callback returns no certificate, the OpenSSL library will not send
+ a certificate.
+ 
+ =head1 BUGS
+ 
+ The client_cert_cb() cannot return a complete certificate chain, it can
+ only return one client certificate. If the chain only has a length of 2,
+ the root CA certificate may be omitted according to the TLS standard and
+ thus a standard conforming answer can be sent to the server. For a
+ longer chain, the client must send the complete chain (with the option
+ to leave out the root CA certificate). This can only be accomplished by
+ either adding the intermediate CA certificates into the trusted
+ certificate store for the SSL_CTX object (resulting in having to add
+ CA certificates that otherwise maybe would not be trusted), or by adding
+ the chain certificates using the
+ L<SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert(3)|SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert(3)>
+ function, which is only available for the SSL_CTX object as a whole and that
+ therefore probably can only apply for one client certificate, making
+ the concept of the callback function (to allow the choice from several
+ certificates) questionable.
+ 
+ Once the SSL object has been used in conjunction with the callback function,
+ the certificate will be set for the SSL object and will not be cleared
+ even when L<SSL_clear(3)|SSL_clear(3)> is being called. It is therefore
+ mandatory to destroy the SSL object using L<SSL_free(3)|SSL_free(3)>
+ and create a new one to return to the previous state.

+ 
+  #include <openssl/ssl.h>
+ 
+  void SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL_CTX *ctx, int mode);
+  int SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown(SSL_CTX *ctx);

+  void SSL_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL *ssl, int mode);
+  int SSL_get_quiet_shutdown(SSL *ssl);
+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for B<ctx> to be
+ B<mode>. SSL objects created from B<ctx> inherit the B<mode> valid at the time
+ L<SSL_new(3)|SSL_new(3)> is called. B<mode> may be 0 or 1.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of B<ctx>.
+ 
+ SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for B<ssl> to be
+ B<mode>. The setting stays valid until B<ssl> is removed with
+ L<SSL_free(3)|SSL_free(3)> or SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() is called again.
+ It is not changed when L<SSL_clear(3)|SSL_clear(3)> is called.
+ B<mode> may be 0 or 1.
+ 
+ SSL_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of B<ssl>.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ Normally when a SSL connection is finished, the parties must send out
+ "close notify" alert messages using L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)>
+ for a clean shutdown.
+ 
+ When setting the "quiet shutdown" flag to 1, L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)>
+ will set the internal flags to SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.
+ (L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)> then behaves like
+ L<SSL_set_shutdown(3)|SSL_set_shutdown(3)> called with
+ SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.)
+ The session is thus considered to be shutdown, but no "close notify" alert
+ is sent to the peer. This behaviour violates the TLS standard.
+ 
+ The default is normal shutdown behaviour as described by the TLS standard.

+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback() sets the callback function for B<ctx> to be
+ used when a DH parameters are required to B<tmp_dh_callback>.
+ The callback is inherited by all B<ssl> objects created from B<ctx>.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh() sets DH parameters to be used to be B<dh>.
+ The key is inherited by all B<ssl> objects created from B<ctx>.
+ 
+ SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() sets the callback only for B<ssl>.
+ 
+ SSL_set_tmp_dh() sets the parameters only for B<ssl>.
+ 
+ These functions apply to SSL/TLS servers only.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ When using a cipher with RSA authentication, an ephemeral DH key exchange
+ can take place. Ciphers with DSA keys always use ephemeral DH keys as well.
+ In these cases, the session data are negotiated using the
+ ephemeral/temporary DH key and the key supplied and certified
+ by the certificate chain is only used for signing.
+ Anonymous ciphers (without a permanent server key) also use ephemeral DH keys.
+ 
+ Using ephemeral DH key exchange yields forward secrecy, as the connection
+ can only be decrypted, when the DH key is known. By generating a temporary
+ DH key inside the server application that is lost when the application
+ is left, it becomes impossible for an attacker to decrypt past sessions,
+ even if he gets hold of the normal (certified) key, as this key was
+ only used for signing.
+ 
+ In order to perform a DH key exchange the server must use a DH group
+ (DH parameters) and generate a DH key. The server will always generate a new
+ DH key during the negotiation, when the DH parameters are supplied via
+ callback and/or when the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option of
+ L<SSL_CTX_set_options(3)|SSL_CTX_set_options(3)> is set. It will
+ immediately create a DH key, when DH parameters are supplied via
+ SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh() and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not set. In this case,
+ it may happen that a key is generated on initialization without later
+ being needed, while on the other hand the computer time during the
+ negotiation is being saved.
+ 
+ If "strong" primes were used to generate the DH parameters, it is not strictly
+ necessary to generate a new key for each handshake but it does improve forward
+ secrecy. If it is not assured, that "strong" primes were used (see especially
+ the section about DSA parameters below), SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE must be used
+ in order to prevent small subgroup attacks. Always using SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE
+ has an impact on the computer time needed during negotiation, but it is not
+ very large, so application authors/users should consider to always enable
+ this option.
+ 
+ As generating DH parameters is extremely time consuming, an application
+ should not generate the parameters on the fly but supply the parameters.
+ DH parameters can be reused, as the actual key is newly generated during
+ the negotiation. The risk in reusing DH parameters is that an attacker
+ may specialize on a very often used DH group. Applications should therefore
+ generate their own DH parameters during the installation process using the
+ openssl L<dhparam(1)|dhparam(1)> application. In order to reduce the computer
+ time needed for this generation, it is possible to use DSA parameters
+ instead (see L<dhparam(1)|dhparam(1)>), but in this case SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE
+ is mandatory.
+ 
+ Application authors may compile in DH parameters. Files dh512.pem,
+ dh1024.pem, dh2048.pem, and dh4096 in the 'apps' directory of current
+ version of the OpenSSL distribution contain the 'SKIP' DH parameters,
+ which use safe primes and were generated verifiably pseudo-randomly.
+ These files can be converted into C code using the B<-C> option of the
+ L<dhparam(1)|dhparam(1)> application.
+ Authors may also generate their own set of parameters using
+ L<dhparam(1)|dhparam(1)>, but a user may not be sure how the parameters were
+ generated. The generation of DH parameters during installation is therefore
+ recommended.
+ 
+ An application may either directly specify the DH parameters or
+ can supply the DH parameters via a callback function. The callback approach
+ has the advantage, that the callback may supply DH parameters for different
+ key lengths.
+ 
+ The B<tmp_dh_callback> is called with the B<keylength> needed and
+ the B<is_export> information. The B<is_export> flag is set, when the
+ ephemeral DH key exchange is performed with an export cipher.

+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback() sets the callback function for B<ctx> to be
+ used when a temporary/ephemeral RSA key is required to B<tmp_rsa_callback>.
+ The callback is inherited by all SSL objects newly created from B<ctx>
+ with <SSL_new(3)|SSL_new(3)>. Already created SSL objects are not affected.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa() sets the temporary/ephemeral RSA key to be used to be
+ B<rsa>. The key is inherited by all SSL objects newly created from B<ctx>
+ with <SSL_new(3)|SSL_new(3)>. Already created SSL objects are not affected.
+ 
+ SSL_CTX_need_tmp_rsa() returns 1, if a temporary/ephemeral RSA key is needed
+ for RSA-based strength-limited 'exportable' ciphersuites because a RSA key
+ with a keysize larger than 512 bits is installed.
+ 
+ SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback() sets the callback only for B<ssl>.
+ 
+ SSL_set_tmp_rsa() sets the key only for B<ssl>.
+ 
+ SSL_need_tmp_rsa() returns 1, if a temporary/ephemeral RSA key is needed,
+ for RSA-based strength-limited 'exportable' ciphersuites because a RSA key
+ with a keysize larger than 512 bits is installed.
+ 
+ These functions apply to SSL/TLS servers only.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ When using a cipher with RSA authentication, an ephemeral RSA key exchange
+ can take place. In this case the session data are negotiated using the
+ ephemeral/temporary RSA key and the RSA key supplied and certified
+ by the certificate chain is only used for signing.
+ 
+ Under previous export restrictions, ciphers with RSA keys shorter (512 bits)
+ than the usual key length of 1024 bits were created. To use these ciphers
+ with RSA keys of usual length, an ephemeral key exchange must be performed,
+ as the normal (certified) key cannot be directly used.
+ 
+ Using ephemeral RSA key exchange yields forward secrecy, as the connection
+ can only be decrypted, when the RSA key is known. By generating a temporary
+ RSA key inside the server application that is lost when the application
+ is left, it becomes impossible for an attacker to decrypt past sessions,
+ even if he gets hold of the normal (certified) RSA key, as this key was
+ used for signing only. The downside is that creating a RSA key is
+ computationally expensive.
+ 
+ Additionally, the use of ephemeral RSA key exchange is only allowed in
+ the TLS standard, when the RSA key can be used for signing only, that is
+ for export ciphers. Using ephemeral RSA key exchange for other purposes
+ violates the standard and can break interoperability with clients.
+ It is therefore strongly recommended to not use ephemeral RSA key
+ exchange and use EDH (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) key exchange instead
+ in order to achieve forward secrecy (see
+ L<SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback(3)|SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback(3)>).
+ 
+ On OpenSSL servers ephemeral RSA key exchange is therefore disabled by default
+ and must be explicitly enabled  using the SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA option of
+ L<SSL_CTX_set_options(3)|SSL_CTX_set_options(3)>, violating the TLS/SSL
+ standard. When ephemeral RSA key exchange is required for export ciphers,
+ it will automatically be used without this option!
+ 
+ An application may either directly specify the key or can supply the key via
+ a callback function. The callback approach has the advantage, that the
+ callback may generate the key only in case it is actually needed. As the
+ generation of a RSA key is however costly, it will lead to a significant
+ delay in the handshake procedure.  Another advantage of the callback function
+ is that it can supply keys of different size (e.g. for SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA
+ usage) while the explicit setting of the key is only useful for key size of
+ 512 bits to satisfy the export restricted ciphers and does give away key length
+ if a longer key would be allowed.
+ 
+ The B<tmp_rsa_callback> is called with the B<keylength> needed and
+ the B<is_export> information. The B<is_export> flag is set, when the
+ ephemeral RSA key exchange is performed with an export cipher.
+ 
+ =head1 EXAMPLES
+ 
+ Generate temporary RSA keys to prepare ephemeral RSA key exchange. As the
+ generation of a RSA key costs a lot of computer time, they saved for later
+ reuse. For demonstration purposes, two keys for 512 bits and 1024 bits
+ respectively are generated.

+  int SSL_do_handshake(SSL *ssl);
+ 
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+ 
+ SSL_do_handshake() will wait for a SSL/TLS handshake to take place. If the
+ connection is in client mode, the handshake will be started. The handshake
+ routines may have to be explicitly set in advance using either
+ L<SSL_set_connect_state(3)|SSL_set_connect_state(3)> or
+ L<SSL_set_accept_state(3)|SSL_set_accept_state(3)>.
+ 
+ =head1 NOTES
+ 
+ The behaviour of SSL_do_handshake() depends on the underlying BIO.
+ 
+ If the underlying BIO is B<blocking>, SSL_do_handshake() will only return
+ once the handshake has been finished or an error occurred, except for SGC
+ (Server Gated Cryptography). For SGC, SSL_do_handshake() may return with -1,
+ but SSL_get_error() will yield B<SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE> and
+ SSL_do_handshake() should be called again.
+ 
+ If the underlying BIO is B<non-blocking>, SSL_do_handshake() will also return
+ when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_do_handshake()
+ to continue the handshake. In this case a call to SSL_get_error() with the
+ return value of SSL_do_handshake() will yield B<SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ> or
+ B<SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE>. The calling process then must repeat the call after
+ taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of SSL_do_handshake().
+ The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket,
+ nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required
+ condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written
+ into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.

! The shutdown procedure consists of 2 steps: the sending of the "close notify"
! shutdown alert and the reception of the peer's "close notify" shutdown
! alert. According to the TLS standard, it is acceptable for an application
! to only send its shutdown alert and then close the underlying connection
! without waiting for the peer's response (this way resources can be saved,
! as the process can already terminate or serve another connection).
! When the underlying connection shall be used for more communications, the

! SSL_shutdown() supports both uni- and bidirectional shutdown by its 2 step
! behaviour.

! =item When the application is the first party to send the "close notify"
! alert, SSL_shutdown() will only send the alert and the set the

! be kept in cache). SSL_shutdown() will then return with 0. If a unidirectional
! shutdown is enough (the underlying connection shall be closed anyway), this
! first call to SSL_shutdown() is sufficient. In order to complete the
! bidirectional shutdown handshake, SSL_shutdown() must be called again.
! The second call will make SSL_shutdown() wait for the peer's "close notify"
! shutdown alert. On success, the second call to SSL_shutdown() will return
! with 1.
! 
! =item If the peer already sent the "close notify" alert B<and> it was
! already processed implicitly inside another function
! (L<SSL_read(3)|SSL_read(3)>), the SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN flag is set.
! SSL_shutdown() will send the "close notify" alert, set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN
! flag and will immediately return with 1.

- 
- =head1 NAME
- 
- SSL - OpenSSL SSL/TLS library
- 
- =head1 SYNOPSIS
- 
- =head1 DESCRIPTION
- 
- The OpenSSL B<ssl> library implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
- Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols. It provides a rich API which is
- documented here.
- 
- =head1 HEADER FILES
- 
- Currently the OpenSSL B<ssl> library provides the following C header files
- containing the prototypes for the data structures and and functions:
- 
- =over 4
- 
- =item B<ssl.h>
- 
- That's the common header file for the SSL/TLS API.  Include it into your
- program to make the API of the B<ssl> library available. It internally
- includes both more private SSL headers and headers from the B<crypto> library.
- Whenever you need hard-core details on the internals of the SSL API, look
- inside this header file.
- 
- =item B<ssl2.h>
- 
- That's the sub header file dealing with the SSLv2 protocol only.
- I<Usually you don't have to include it explicitly because
- it's already included by ssl.h>.
- 
- =item B<ssl3.h>
- 
- That's the sub header file dealing with the SSLv3 protocol only.
- I<Usually you don't have to include it explicitly because
- it's already included by ssl.h>.
- 
- =item B<ssl23.h>
- 
- That's the sub header file dealing with the combined use of the SSLv2 and
- SSLv3 protocols.
- I<Usually you don't have to include it explicitly because
- it's already included by ssl.h>.
- 
- =item B<tls1.h>
- 
- That's the sub header file dealing with the TLSv1 protocol only.
- I<Usually you don't have to include it explicitly because
- it's already included by ssl.h>.
- 
- =back
- 
- =head1 DATA STRUCTURES
- 
- Currently the OpenSSL B<ssl> library functions deals with the following data
- structures:
- 
- =over 4
- 
- =item B<SSL_METHOD> (SSL Method)
- 
- That's a dispatch structure describing the internal B<ssl> library
- methods/functions which implement the various protocol versions (SSLv1, SSLv2
- and TLSv1). It's needed to create an B<SSL_CTX>.
- 
- =item B<SSL_CIPHER> (SSL Cipher)
- 
- This structure holds the algorithm information for a particular cipher which
- are a core part of the SSL/TLS protocol. The available ciphers are configured
- on a B<SSL_CTX> basis and the actually used ones are then part of the
- B<SSL_SESSION>.
- 
- =item B<SSL_CTX> (SSL Context)
- 
- That's the global context structure which is created by a server or client
- once per program life-time and which holds mainly default values for the
- B<SSL> structures which are later created for the connections.
- 
- =item B<SSL_SESSION> (SSL Session)
- 
- This is a structure containing the current SSL session details for a
- connection: B<SSL_CIPHER>s, client and server certificates, keys, etc.
- 
- =item B<SSL> (SSL Connection)
- 
- That's the main SSL/TLS structure which is created by a server or client per
- established connection. This actually is the core structure in the SSL API.
- Under run-time the application usually deals with this structure which has
- links to mostly all other structures.
- 
- =back
- 
- =head1 API FUNCTIONS
- 
- Currently the OpenSSL B<ssl> library exports 214 API functions.
- They are documented in the following:
- 
- =head2 DEALING WITH PROTOCOL METHODS
- 
- Here we document the various API functions which deal with the SSL/TLS
- protocol methods defined in B<SSL_METHOD> structures.
- 
- =over 4
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv2_client_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv2 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated client.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv2_server_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv2 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated server.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv2_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv2 SSL_METHOD structure for combined client and server.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv3_client_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv3 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated client.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv3_server_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv3 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated server.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<SSLv3_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the SSLv3 SSL_METHOD structure for combined client and server.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<TLSv1_client_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the TLSv1 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated client.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<TLSv1_server_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the TLSv1 SSL_METHOD structure for a dedicated server.
- 
- =item SSL_METHOD *B<TLSv1_method>(void);
- 
- Constructor for the TLSv1 SSL_METHOD structure for combined client and server.
- 
- =back
- 
- =head2 DEALING WITH CIPHERS
- 
- Here we document the various API functions which deal with the SSL/TLS
- ciphers defined in B<SSL_CIPHER> structures.
- 
- =over 4
- 
- =item char *B<SSL_CIPHER_description>(SSL_CIPHER *cipher, char *buf, int len);
- 
- Write a string to I<buf> (with a maximum size of I<len>) containing a human
- readable description of I<cipher>. Returns I<buf>.
- 
- =item int B<SSL_CIPHER_get_bits>(SSL_CIPHER *cipher, int *alg_bits);
- 
- Determine the number of bits in I<cipher>. Because of export crippled ciphers
- there are two bits: The bits the algorithm supports in general (stored to
- I<alg_bits>) and the bits which are actually used (the return value).
- 
- =item char *B<SSL_CIPHER_get_name>(SSL_CIPHER *cipher);
- 
- Return the internal name of I<cipher> as a string. These are the various
- strings defined by the I<SSL2_TXT_xxx>, I<SSL3_TXT_xxx> and I<TLS1_TXT_xxx>
- definitions in the header files.
- 
- =item char *B<SSL_CIPHER_get_version>(SSL_CIPHER *cipher);
- 
- Returns a string like "C<TLSv1/SSLv3>" or "C<SSLv2>" which indicates the
- SSL/TLS protocol version to which I<cipher> belongs (i.e. where it was defined
- in the specification the first time).
- 
- =back
- 
- =head2 DEALING WITH PROTOCOL CONTEXTS
- 
- Here we document the various API functions which deal with the SSL/TLS
- protocol context defined in the B<SSL_CTX> structure.

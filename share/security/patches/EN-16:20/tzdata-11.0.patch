+Contributing to the tz code and data
+
+The time zone database is by no means authoritative: governments
+change timekeeping rules erratically and sometimes with little
+warning, the data entries do not cover all of civil time before
+1970, and undoubtedly errors remain in the code and data.  Feel
+free to fill gaps or fix mistakes, and please email improvements
+to tz@iana.org for use in the future.
+
+To email small changes, please run a POSIX shell command like
+'diff -u old/europe new/europe >myfix.patch', and attach
+myfix.patch to the email.
+
+For more-elaborate changes, please read the Theory file and browse
+the mailing list archives <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/> for
+examples of patches that tend to work well.  Ideally, additions to
+data should contain commentary citing reliable sources as
+justification.
+
+Please submit changes against either the latest release in
+<ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/> or the master branch of the experimental
+Git repository.  If you use Git the following workflow may be helpful:
+
+  * Copy the experimental repository.
+
+      git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz.git
+      cd tz
+
+  * Get current with the master branch.
+
+      git checkout master
+      git pull
+
+  * Switch to a new branch for the changes.  Choose a different
+    branch name for each change set.
+
+      git checkout -b mybranch
+
+  * Edit source files.  Include commentary that justifies the
+    changes by citing reliable sources.
+
+  * Debug the changes, e.g.:
+
+      make check
+      make install
+      ./zdump -v America/Los_Angeles
+
+  * For each separable change, commit it in the new branch, e.g.:
+
+      git add northamerica
+      git commit
+
+    See recent 'git log' output for the commit-message style.
+
+  * Create patch files 0001-*, 0002-*, ...
+
+      git format-patch master
+
+  * After reviewing the patch files, send the patches to tz@iana.org
+    for others to review.
+
+      git send-email master
+
+  * Start anew by getting current with the master branch again
+    (the second step above).
+
+Please do not create issues or pull requests on GitHub, as the
+proper procedure for proposing and distributing patches is via
+email as illustrated above.

+# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  If not defined, the code attempts to

+# and define NO_TM_ZONE to suppress any guessing.  These two fields are not

+#
+# If you want functions that were inspired by early versions of X3J11's work,

+# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  This arranges for the functions
+# "tzsetwall", "offtime", "timelocal", "timegm", "timeoff",
+# "posix2time", and "time2posix" to be added to the time conversion library.
+# "tzsetwall" is like "tzset" except that it arranges for local wall clock
+# time (rather than the time specified in the TZ environment variable)
+# to be used.
+# "offtime" is like "gmtime" except that it accepts a second (long) argument
+# that gives an offset to add to the time_t when converting it.
+# "timelocal" is equivalent to "mktime".
+# "timegm" is like "timelocal" except that it turns a struct tm into
+# a time_t using UT (rather than local time as "timelocal" does).
+# "timeoff" is like "timegm" except that it accepts a second (long) argument
+# that gives an offset to use when converting to a time_t.
+# "posix2time" and "time2posix" are described in an included manual page.
+# X3J11's work does not describe any of these functions.
+# Sun has provided "tzsetwall", "timelocal", and "timegm" in SunOS 4.0.
+# These functions may well disappear in future releases of the time
+# conversion package.
+#
+# If you don't want functions that were inspired by NetBSD, add
+#	-DNETBSD_INSPIRED=0
+# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  Otherwise, the functions
+# "localtime_rz", "mktime_z", "tzalloc", and "tzfree" are added to the
+# time library, and if STD_INSPIRED is also defined the functions
+# "posix2time_z" and "time2posix_z" are added as well.
+# The functions ending in "_z" (or "_rz") are like their unsuffixed
+# (or suffixed-by-"_r") counterparts, except with an extra first
+# argument of opaque type timezone_t that specifies the time zone.
+# "tzalloc" allocates a timezone_t value, and "tzfree" frees it.
+#
+# If you want to allocate state structures in localtime, add
+#	-DALL_STATE
+# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  Storage is obtained by calling malloc.
+#
+# If you want an "altzone" variable (a la System V Release 3.1), add
+#	-DALTZONE
+# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.
+# This variable is not described in X3J11's work.

+Release 2016i - 2016-11-01 23:19:52 -0700
+
+  Briefly: Cyprus split into two time zones on 2016-10-30, and Tonga
+  reintroduces DST on 2016-11-06.
+
+  Changes to future time stamps
+
+    Pacific/Tongatapu begins DST on 2016-11-06 at 02:00, ending on
+    2017-01-15 at 03:00.  Assume future observances in Tonga will be
+    from the first Sunday in November through the third Sunday in
+    January, like Fiji.  (Thanks to Pulu ʻAnau.)  Switch to numeric
+    time zone abbreviations for this zone.
+
+  Changes to past and future time stamps
+
+    Northern Cyprus is now +03 year round, causing a split in Cyprus
+    time zones starting 2016-10-30 at 04:00.  This creates a zone
+    Asia/Famagusta.  (Thanks to Even Scharning and Matt Johnson.)
+
+    Antarctica/Casey switched from +08 to +11 on 2016-10-22.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Changes to past time stamps
+
+    Several corrections were made for pre-1975 time stamps in Italy.
+    These affect Europe/Malta, Europe/Rome, Europe/San_Marino, and
+    Europe/Vatican.
+
+    First, the 1893-11-01 00:00 transition in Italy used the new UT
+    offset (+01), not the old (+00:49:56).  (Thanks to Michael
+    Deckers.)
+
+    Second, rules for daylight saving in Italy were changed to agree
+    with Italy's National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM)
+    except for 1944, as follows (thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi, Brian
+    Inglis, and Michael Deckers):
+
+      The 1916-06-03 transition was at 24:00, not 00:00.
+
+      The 1916-10-01, 1919-10-05, and 1920-09-19 transitions were at
+      00:00, not 01:00.
+
+      The 1917-09-30 and 1918-10-06 transitions were at 24:00, not
+      01:00.
+
+      The 1944-09-17 transition was at 03:00, not 01:00.  This
+      particular change is taken from Italian law as INRiM's table,
+      (which says 02:00) appears to have a typo here.  Also, keep the
+      1944-04-03 transition for Europe/Rome, as Rome was controlled by
+      Germany then.
+
+      The 1967-1970 and 1972-1974 fallback transitions were at 01:00,
+      not 00:00.
+
+  Changes to code
+
+    The code should now be buildable on AmigaOS merely by setting the
+    appropriate Makefile variables.  (From a patch by Carsten Larsen.)
+
+
+Release 2016h - 2016-10-19 23:17:57 -0700
+
+  Changes to future time stamps
+
+    Asia/Gaza and Asia/Hebron end DST on 2016-10-29 at 01:00, not
+    2016-10-21 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)  Predict that
+    future fall transitions will be on the last Saturday of October
+    at 01:00, which is consistent with predicted spring transitions
+    on the last Saturday of March.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)
+
+  Changes to past time stamps
+
+    In Turkey, transitions in 1986-1990 were at 01:00 standard time
+    not at 02:00, and the spring 1994 transition was on March 20, not
+    March 27.  (Thanks to Kıvanç Yazan.)
+
+  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations
+
+    Asia/Colombo now uses numeric time zone abbreviations like "+0530"
+    instead of alphabetic ones like "IST" and "LKT".  Various
+    English-language sources use "IST", "LKT" and "SLST", with no
+    working consensus.  (Usage of "SLST" mentioned by Sadika
+    Sumanapala.)
+
+  Changes to code
+
+    zic no longer mishandles relativizing file names when creating
+    symbolic links like /etc/localtime, when these symbolic links
+    are outside the usual directory hierarchy.  This fixes a bug
+    introduced in 2016g.  (Problem reported by Andreas Stieger.)
+
+  Changes to build procedure
+
+    New rules 'traditional_tarballs' and 'traditional_signatures' for
+    building just the traditional-format distribution.  (Requested by
+    Deborah Goldsmith.)
+
+    The file 'version' is now put into the tzdata tarball too.
+    (Requested by Howard Hinnant.)
+
+  Changes to documentation and commentary
+
+    The 'Theory' file now has a section on interface stability.
+    (Requested by Paul Koning.)  It also mentions features like
+    tm_zone and localtime_rz that have long been supported by the
+    reference code.
+
+    tz-link.htm has improved coverage of time zone boundaries suitable
+    for geolocation.  (Thanks to heads-ups from Evan Siroky and Matt
+    Johnson.)
+
+    The US commentary now mentions Allen and the "day of two noons".
+
+    The Fiji commentary mentions the government's 2016-10-03 press
+    release.  (Thanks to Raymond Kumar.)
+
+
+Release 2016g - 2016-09-13 08:56:38 -0700
+
+  Changes to future time stamps
+
+    Turkey switched from EET/EEST (+02/+03) to permanent +03,
+    effective 2016-09-07.  (Thanks to Burak AYDIN.)  Use "+03" rather
+    than an invented abbreviation for the new time.
+
+    New leap second 2016-12-31 23:59:60 UTC as per IERS Bulletin C 52.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)
+
+  Changes to past time stamps
+
+    For America/Los_Angeles, spring-forward transition times have been
+    corrected from 02:00 to 02:01 in 1948, and from 02:00 to 01:00 in
+    1950-1966.
+
+    For zones using Soviet time on 1919-07-01, transitions to UT-based
+    time were at 00:00 UT, not at 02:00 local time.  The affected
+    zones are Europe/Kirov, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Samara, and
+    Europe/Ulyanovsk.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)
+
+  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations
+
+    The Factory zone now uses the time zone abbreviation -00 instead
+    of a long English-language string, as -00 is now the normal way to
+    represent an undefined time zone.
+
+    Several zones in Antarctica and the former Soviet Union, along
+    with zones intended for ships at sea that cannot use POSIX TZ
+    strings, now use numeric time zone abbreviations instead of
+    invented or obsolete alphanumeric abbreviations.  The affected
+    zones are Antarctica/Casey, Antarctica/Davis,
+    Antarctica/DumontDUrville, Antarctica/Mawson, Antarctica/Rothera,
+    Antarctica/Syowa, Antarctica/Troll, Antarctica/Vostok,
+    Asia/Anadyr, Asia/Ashgabat, Asia/Baku, Asia/Bishkek, Asia/Chita,
+    Asia/Dushanbe, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Kamchatka, Asia/Khandyga,
+    Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Magadan, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Sakhalin,
+    Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Srednekolymsk, Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Tbilisi,
+    Asia/Ust-Nera, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Yekaterinburg,
+    Asia/Yerevan, Etc/GMT-14, Etc/GMT-13, Etc/GMT-12, Etc/GMT-11,
+    Etc/GMT-10, Etc/GMT-9, Etc/GMT-8, Etc/GMT-7, Etc/GMT-6, Etc/GMT-5,
+    Etc/GMT-4, Etc/GMT-3, Etc/GMT-2, Etc/GMT-1, Etc/GMT+1, Etc/GMT+2,
+    Etc/GMT+3, Etc/GMT+4, Etc/GMT+5, Etc/GMT+6, Etc/GMT+7, Etc/GMT+8,
+    Etc/GMT+9, Etc/GMT+10, Etc/GMT+11, Etc/GMT+12, Europe/Kaliningrad,
+    Europe/Minsk, Europe/Samara, Europe/Volgograd, and
+    Indian/Kerguelen.  For Europe/Moscow the invented abbreviation MSM
+    was replaced by +05, whereas MSK and MSD were kept as they are not
+    our invention and are widely used.
+
+  Changes to zone names
+
+    Rename Asia/Rangoon to Asia/Yangon, with a backward compatibility link.
+    (Thanks to David Massoud.)
+
+  Changes to code
+
+    zic no longer generates binary files containing POSIX TZ-like
+    strings that disagree with the local time type after the last
+    explicit transition in the data.  This fixes a bug with
+    Africa/Casablanca and Africa/El_Aaiun in some year-2037 time
+    stamps on the reference platform.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky
+    for reporting the bug and suggesting a way forward.)
+
+    If the installed localtime and/or posixrules files are symbolic
+    links, zic now keeps them symbolic links when updating them, for
+    compatibility with platforms like OpenSUSE where other programs
+    configure these files as symlinks.
+
+    zic now avoids hard linking to symbolic links, avoids some
+    unnecessary mkdir and stat system calls, and uses shorter file
+    names internally.
+
+    zdump has a new -i option to generate transitions in a
+    more-compact but still human-readable format.  This option is
+    experimental, and the output format may change in future versions.
+    (Thanks to Jon Skeet for suggesting that an option was needed,
+    and thanks to Tim Parenti and Chris Rovick for further comments.)
+
+  Changes to build procedure
+
+    An experimental distribution format is available, in addition
+    to the traditional format which will continue to be distributed.
+    The new format is a tarball tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz with signature
+    file tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz.asc.  It unpacks to a top-level directory
+    tzdb-VERSION containing the code and data of the traditional
+    two-tarball format, along with extra data that may be useful.
+    (Thanks to Antonio Diaz Diaz, Oscar van Vlijmen, and many others
+    for comments about the experimental format.)
+
+    The release version number is now more accurate in the usual case
+    where releases are built from a Git repository.  For example, if
+    23 commits and some working-file changes have been made since
+    release 2016g, the version number is now something like
+    '2016g-23-g50556e3-dirty' instead of the misleading '2016g'.
+    Official releases uses the same version number format as before,
+    e.g., '2016g'.  To support the more-accurate version number, its
+    specification has moved from a line in the Makefile to a new
+    source file 'version'.
+
+    The experimental distribution contains a file to2050.tzs that
+    contains what should be the output of 'zdump -i -c 2050' on
+    primary zones.  If this file is available, 'make check' now checks
+    that zdump generates this output.
+
+    'make check_web' now works on Fedora-like distributions.
+
+  Changes to documentation and commentary
+
+    tzfile.5 now documents the new restriction on POSIX TZ-like
+    strings that is now implemented by zic.
+
+    Comments now cite URLs for some 1917-1921 Russian DST decrees.
+    (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)
+
+    tz-link.htm mentions JuliaTime (thanks to Curtis Vogt) and Time4J
+    (thanks to Meno Hochschild) and ThreeTen-Extra, and its
+    description of Java 8 has been brought up to date (thanks to
+    Stephen Colebourne).  Its description of local time on Mars has
+    been updated to match current practice, and URLs have been updated
+    and some obsolete ones removed.

+Release 2016f - 2016-07-05 16:26:51 +0200
+
+  Changes affecting future time stamps
+
+    The Egyptian government changed its mind on short notice, and
+    Africa/Cairo will not introduce DST starting 2016-07-07 after all.
+    (Thanks to Mina Samuel.)
+
+    Asia/Novosibirsk switches from +06 to +07 on 2016-07-24 at 02:00.

+
+  Changes to past and future time stamps
+
+    Asia/Novokuznetsk and Asia/Novosibirsk now use numeric time zone
+    abbreviations instead of invented ones.
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    Europe/Minsk's 1992-03-29 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 not 00:00.

+
+
+Release 2016e - 2016-06-14 08:46:16 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting future time stamps
+
+    Africa/Cairo observes DST in 2016 from July 7 to the end of October.
+    Guess October 27 and 24:00 transitions.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+    For future years, guess April's last Thursday to October's last
+    Thursday except for Ramadan.
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    Locations while uninhabited now use '-00', not 'zzz', as a
+    placeholder time zone abbreviation.  This is inspired by Internet
+    RFC 3339 and is more consistent with numeric time zone
+    abbreviations already used elsewhere.  The change affects several
+    arctic and antarctic locations, e.g., America/Cambridge_Bay before
+    1920 and Antarctica/Troll before 2005.
+
+    Asia/Baku's 1992-09-27 transition from +04 (DST) to +04 (non-DST) was
+    at 03:00, not 23:00 the previous day.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)
+
+  Changes to code
+
+    zic now outputs a dummy transition at time 2**31 - 1 in zones
+    whose POSIX-style TZ strings contain a '<'.  This mostly works
+    around Qt bug 53071 <https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-53071>.
+    (Thanks to Zhanibek Adilbekov for reporting the Qt bug.)
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    tz-link.htm says why governments should give plenty of notice for

+    1989-03-26 at 02:00, roughly a year after Europe/Volgograd made
+    the same change.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)
+
+    Russia and nearby locations had daylight-saving transitions on
+    1992-03-29 at 02:00 and 1992-09-27 at 03:00, instead of on

+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    Europe/Kaliningrad and Europe/Vilnius changed from +03/+04 to

+
+Release 2016b - 2016-03-12 17:30:14 -0800
+
+  Compatibility note
+
+    Starting with release 2016b, some data entries cause zic implementations
+    derived from tz releases 2005j through 2015e to issue warnings like
+    "time zone abbreviation differs from POSIX standard (+03)".
+    These warnings should not otherwise affect zic's output and can safely be
+    ignored on today's platforms, as the warnings refer to a restriction in
+    POSIX.1-1988 that was removed in POSIX.1-2001.  One way to suppress the
+    warnings is to upgrade to zic derived from tz releases 2015f and later.
+
+  Changes affecting future time stamps
+
+    New zones Europe/Astrakhan and Europe/Ulyanovsk for Astrakhan and
+    Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Russia, both of which will switch from +03 to +04 on
+    2016-03-27 at 02:00 local time.  They need distinct zones since their
+    post-1970 histories disagree.  New zone Asia/Barnaul for Altai Krai and
+    Altai Republic, Russia, which will switch from +06 to +07 on the same date
+    and local time.  The Astrakhan change is already official; the others have
+    passed the first reading in the State Duma and are extremely likely.
+    Also, Asia/Sakhalin moves from +10 to +11 on 2016-03-27 at 02:00.
+    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev for the heads-up, and to Matt Johnson
+    and Stepan Golosunov for followup.)
+
+    As a trial of a new system that needs less information to be made up,
+    the new zones use numeric time zone abbreviations like "+04"
+    instead of invented abbreviations like "ASTT".
+
+    Haiti will not observe DST in 2016.  (Thanks to Jean Antoine via
+    Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+    Palestine's spring-forward transition on 2016-03-26 is at 01:00, not 00:00.
+    (Thanks to Hannah Kreitem.) Guess future transitions will be March's last
+    Saturday at 01:00, not March's last Friday at 24:00.

+
+    Europe/Chisinau observed DST during 1990, and switched from +04 to

+
+    The two characters '%z' in a zone format now stand for the UTC

+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    The following changes affect some pre-1991 Chile-related time stamps

+
+      The 1910 transition was January 10, not January 1.
+
+      The 1918 transition was September 10, not September 1.
+
+      The UT -04 time observed from 1932 to 1942 is now considered to
+      be standard time, not year-round DST.
+
+      Santiago observed DST (UT -03) from 1946-07-15 through
+      1946-08-31, then reverted to standard time, then switched to -05
+      on 1947-04-01.
+
+      Assume transitions before 1968 were at 00:00, since we have no data
+      saying otherwise.
+
+      The spring 1988 transition was 1988-10-09, not 1988-10-02.
+      The fall 1990 transition was 1990-03-11, not 1990-03-18.
+
+      Assume no UTC offset change for Pacific/Easter on 1890-01-01,
+      and omit all transitions on Pacific/Easter from 1942 through 1946
+      since we have no data suggesting that they existed.
+
+    One more zone has been turned into a link, as it differed
+    from an existing zone only for older time stamps.  As usual,

+
+    Many pre-1989 time stamps have been corrected for Asia/Seoul and
+    Asia/Pyongyang, based on sources for the Korean-language Wikipedia
+    entry for time in Korea.  (Thanks to Sanghyuk Jung.)  Also, no
+    longer guess that Pyongyang mimicked Seoul time after World War II,

+
+  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations
+
+    Since Belarus is not changing its clocks even though Moscow is,
+    the time zone abbreviation in Europe/Minsk is changing from FET
+    to its more-traditional value MSK on 2014-10-26 at 01:00.
+    (Thanks to Alexander Bokovoy for the heads-up about Belarus.)
+
+    The new abbreviation IDT stands for the pre-1976 use of UT +08 in
+    Indochina, to distinguish it better from ICT (+07).
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    Many time stamps have been corrected for Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh before 1976
+    (thanks to Trần Ngọc Quân for an indirect pointer to Trần Tiến Bình's
+    authoritative book).  Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh has been added to
+    zone1970.tab, to give tzselect users in Vietnam two choices,
+    since north and south Vietnam disagreed after our 1970 cutoff.
+
+    Asia/Phnom_Penh and Asia/Vientiane have been turned into links, as
+    they differed from existing zones only for older time stamps.  As
+    usual, these changes affect pre-1970 time stamps only.  Their old
+    contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    The time-related library functions now set errno on failure, and
+    some crashes in the new tzalloc-related library functions have
+    been fixed.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for reporting most of
+    these problems and for suggesting fixes.)
+
+    If USG_COMPAT is defined and the requested time stamp is standard time,
+    the tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set the extern
+    variable timezone to a value appropriate for that time stamp; and
+    similarly for ALTZONE, daylight saving time, and the altzone variable.
+    This change is a companion to the tzname change in 2014h, and is
+    designed to make timezone and altzone more compatible with tzname.
+
+    The tz library's functions now set errno to EOVERFLOW if they fail
+    because the result cannot be represented.  ctime and ctime_r now
+    return NULL and set errno when a time stamp is out of range, rather
+    than having undefined behavior.
+
+    Some bugs associated with the new 2014g functions have been fixed.
+    This includes a bug that largely incapacitated the new functions
+    time2posix_z and posix2time_z.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)
+    It also includes some uses of uninitialized variables after tzalloc.
+    The new code uses the standard type 'ssize_t', which the Makefile

+
+    America/Jamaica's 1974 spring-forward transition was Jan. 6, not Apr. 28.
+
+    Shanks says Asia/Novokuznetsk switched from LMT (not "NMT") on 1924-05-01,
+    not 1920-01-06.  The old entry was based on a misinterpretation of Shanks.
+

+    Africa/Lusaka, Africa/Maseru, and Africa/Mbabane.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    zdump -V and -v now output gmtoff= values on all platforms,
+    not merely on platforms defining TM_GMTOFF.
+
+    The tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set tzname to a value
+    appropriate for the requested time stamp, and zdump now uses this
+    on platforms not defining TM_ZONE, fixing a 2014g regression.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)
+
+    The tz library no longer sets tzname if localtime or mktime fails.
+
+    zdump -c no longer mishandles transitions near year boundaries.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)
+
+    An access to uninitialized data has been fixed.
+    (Thanks to Jörg Richter for reporting the problem.)
+
+    When THREAD_SAFE is defined, the code ports to the C11 memory model.
+    A memory leak has been fixed if ALL_STATE and THREAD_SAFE are defined

+
+    A new file 'backzone' contains data which may appeal to
+    connoisseurs of old time stamps, although it is out of scope for
+    the tz database, is often poorly sourced, and contains some data
+    that is known to be incorrect.  The new file is not recommended
+    for ordinary use and its entries are not installed by default.
+    (Thanks to Lester Caine for the high-quality Jersey, Guernsey, and
+    Isle of Man entries.)
+
+    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
+    from existing zones only for older time stamps.  As usual,
+    these changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only.
+    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
+    The affected zones are: Africa/Bangui, Africa/Brazzaville,
+    Africa/Douala, Africa/Kinshasa, Africa/Libreville, Africa/Luanda,
+    Africa/Malabo, Africa/Niamey, and Africa/Porto-Novo.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    Unless NETBSD_INSPIRED is defined to 0, the tz library now
+    supplies functions for creating and using objects that represent
+    time zones. The new functions are tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz,
+    mktime_z, and (if STD_INSPIRED is also defined) posix2time_z and
+    time2posix_z.  They are intended for performance: for example,
+    localtime_rz (unlike localtime_r) is trivially thread-safe without
+    locking.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for proposing NetBSD-inspired
+    functions, and to Alan Barrett and Jonathan Lennox for helping to
+    debug the change.)
+
+    zdump now builds with the tz library unless USE_LTZ is defined to 0,
+    This lets zdump use tz features even if the system library lacks them.
+    To build zdump with the system library, use 'make CFLAGS=-DUSE_LTZ=0
+    TZDOBJS=zdump.o CHECK_TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES='.
+
+    zdump now uses localtime_rz if available, as it's significantly faster,
+    and it can help zdump better diagnose invalid time zone names.
+    Define HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ to 0 to suppress this.  HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ
+    defaults to 1 if NETBSD_INSPIRED && USE_LTZ.  When localtime_rz is
+    not available, zdump now uses localtime_r and tzset if available,
+    as this is a bit cleaner and faster than plain localtime.  Compile
+    with -DHAVE_LOCALTIME_R=0 and/or -DHAVE_TZSET=0 if your system
+    lacks these two functions.
+
+    If THREAD_SAFE is defined to 1, the tz library is now thread-safe.
+    Although not needed for tz's own applications, which are single-threaded,
+    this supports POSIX better if the tz library is used in multithreaded apps.
+
+    Some crashes have been fixed when zdump or the tz library is given
+    invalid or outlandish input.
+
+    The tz library no longer mishandles leap seconds on platforms with
+    unsigned time_t in time zones that lack ordinary transitions after 1970.
+
+    The tz code now attempts to infer TM_GMTOFF and TM_ZONE if not
+    already defined, to make it easier to configure on common platforms.
+    Define NO_TM_GMTOFF and NO_TM_ZONE to suppress this.
+
+    Unless the new macro UNINIT_TRAP is defined to 1, the tz code now
+    assumes that reading uninitialized memory yields garbage values
+    but does not cause other problems such as traps.
+
+    If TM_GMTOFF is defined and UNINIT_TRAP is 0, mktime is now
+    more likely to guess right for ambiguous time stamps near
+    transitions where tm_isdst does not change.
+
+    If HAVE_STRFTIME_L is defined to 1, the tz library now defines
+    strftime_l for compatibility with recent versions of POSIX.
+    Only the C locale is supported, though.  HAVE_STRFTIME_L defaults
+    to 1 on recent POSIX versions, and to 0 otherwise.
+
+    tzselect -c now uses a hybrid distance measure that works better
+    in Africa.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for noting the problem.)
+
+    The C source code now ports to NetBSD when GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS is used,
+    or when time_tz is defined.
+
+    When HAVE_UTMPX_H is set the 'date' command now builds on systems
+    whose <utmpx.h> file does not define WTMPX_FILE, and when setting
+    the date it updates the wtmpx file if _PATH_WTMPX is defined.
+    This affects GNU/Linux and similar systems.
+
+    For easier maintenance later, some C code has been simplified,
+    some lint has been removed, and the code has been tweaked so that
+    plain 'make' is more likely to work.
+
+    The C type 'bool' is now used for boolean values, instead of 'int'.
+
+    The long-obsolete LOCALE_HOME code has been removed.
+
+    The long-obsolete 'gtime' function has been removed.
+
+  Changes affecting build procedure
+
+    'zdump' no longer links in ialloc.o, as it's not needed.
+
+    'make check_time_t_alternatives' no longer assumes GNU diff.
+
+  Changes affecting distribution tarballs
+
+    The files checktab.awk and zoneinfo2tdf.pl are now distributed in
+    the tzdata tarball instead of the tzcode tarball, since they help
+    maintain the data.  The NEWS and Theory files are now also
+    distributed in the tzdata tarball, as they're relevant for data.
+    (Thanks to Alan Barrett for pointing this out.)  Also, the
+    leapseconds.awk file is no longer distributed in the tzcode
+    tarball, since it belongs in the tzdata tarball (where 2014f
+    inadvertently also distributed it).
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    A new file CONTRIBUTING is distributed.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for
+    suggesting a CONTRIBUTING file, and to Tony Finch and Walter Harms
+    for debugging it.)
+
+    The man pages have been updated to use function prototypes,
+    to document thread-safe variants like localtime_r, and to document
+    the NetBSD-inspired functions tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz, and
+    mktime_z.
+
+    The fields in Link lines have been renamed to be more descriptive
+    and more like the parameters of 'ln'.  LINK-FROM has become TARGET,
+    and LINK-TO has become LINK-NAME.
+
+    tz-link.htm mentions the IETF's tzdist working group; Windows
+    Runtime etc. (thanks to Matt Johnson); and HP-UX's tztab.
+
+    Some broken URLs have been fixed in the commentary.  (Thanks to

+
+    Commentary about Philippines DST has been updated, and commentary
+    on pre-1970 time in India has been added.

+
+    Russia will subtract an hour from most of its time zones on 2014-10-26
+    at 02:00 local time.  (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)
+    There are a few exceptions: Magadan Oblast (Asia/Magadan) and Zabaykalsky
+    Krai are subtracting two hours; conversely, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug
+    (Asia/Anadyr), Kamchatka Krai (Asia/Kamchatka), Kemerovo Oblast
+    (Asia/Novokuznetsk), and the Samara Oblast and the Udmurt Republic
+    (Europe/Samara) are not changing their clocks.  The changed zones are
+    Europe/Kaliningrad, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Simferopol, Europe/Volgograd,
+    Asia/Yekaterinburg, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Novosibirsk, Asia/Krasnoyarsk,
+    Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Khandyga,
+    Asia/Sakhalin, and Asia/Ust-Nera; Asia/Magadan will have two hours
+    subtracted; and Asia/Novokuznetsk's time zone abbreviation is affected,
+    but not its UTC offset.  Two zones are added: Asia/Chita (split
+    from Asia/Yakutsk, and also with two hours subtracted) and
+    Asia/Srednekolymsk (split from Asia/Magadan, but with only one hour
+    subtracted).  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for much of the above.)
+
+  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations
+
+    Australian eastern time zone abbreviations are now AEST/AEDT not EST,
+    and similarly for the other Australian zones.  That is, for eastern
+    standard and daylight saving time the abbreviations are AEST and AEDT
+    instead of the former EST for both; similarly, ACST/ACDT, ACWST/ACWDT,
+    and AWST/AWDT are now used instead of the former CST, CWST, and WST.
+    This change does not affect UTC offsets, only time zone abbreviations.
+    (Thanks to Rich Tibbett and many others.)
+
+    Asia/Novokuznetsk shifts from NOVT to KRAT (remaining on UT +07)
+    effective 2014-10-26 at 02:00 local time.
+
+    The time zone abbreviation for Xinjiang Time (observed in Ürümqi)
+    has been changed from URUT to XJT.  (Thanks to Luther Ma.)
+
+    Prefer MSK/MSD for Moscow time in Russia, even in other cities.
+    Similarly, prefer EET/EEST for eastern European time in Russia.
+
+    Change time zone abbreviations in (western) Samoa to use "ST" and
+    "DT" suffixes, as this is more likely to match common practice.
+    Prefix "W" to (western) Samoa time when its standard-time offset
+    disagrees with that of American Samoa.
+
+    America/Metlakatla now uses PST, not MeST, to abbreviate its time zone.
+
+    Time zone abbreviations have been updated for Japan's two time
+    zones used 1896-1937.  JWST now stands for Western Standard
+    Time, and JCST for Central Standard Time (formerly this was CJT).
+    These abbreviations are now used for time in Korea, Taiwan,
+    and Sakhalin while controlled by Japan.
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    China's five zones have been simplified to two, since the post-1970
+    differences in the other three seem to have been imaginary.  The
+    zones Asia/Harbin, Asia/Chongqing, and Asia/Kashgar have been
+    removed; backwards-compatibility links still work, albeit with
+    different behaviors for time stamps before May 1980.  Asia/Urumqi's
+    1980 transition to UT +08 has been removed, so that it is now at
+    +06 and not +08.  (Thanks to Luther Ma and to Alois Treindl;
+    Treindl sent helpful translations of two papers by Guo Qingsheng.)
+
+    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differed from existing
+    zones only for older UTC offsets where data entries were likely invented.
+    These changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only.  This is
+    similar to the change in release 2013e, except this time for western
+    Africa.  The affected zones are: Africa/Bamako, Africa/Banjul,
+    Africa/Conakry, Africa/Dakar, Africa/Freetown, Africa/Lome,
+    Africa/Nouakchott, Africa/Ouagadougou, Africa/Sao_Tome, and
+    Atlantic/St_Helena.  This also affects the backwards-compatibility
+    link Africa/Timbuktu.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett, Stephen Colebourne,
+    Tim Parenti, and David Patte for reporting problems in earlier
+    versions of this change.)
+
+    Asia/Shanghai's pre-standard-time UT offset has been changed from
+    8:05:57 to 8:05:43, the location of Xujiahui Observatory.  Its
+    transition to standard time has been changed from 1928 to 1901.
+
+    Asia/Taipei switched to JWST on 1896-01-01, then to JST on 1937-10-01,
+    then to CST on 1945-09-21 at 01:00, and did not observe DST in 1945.
+    In 1946 it observed DST from 05-15 through 09-30; in 1947
+    from 04-15 through 10-31; and in 1979 from 07-01 through 09-30.
+    (Thanks to Yu-Cheng Chuang.)
+
+    Asia/Riyadh's transition to standard time is now 1947-03-14, not 1950.
+
+    Europe/Helsinki's 1942 fall-back transition was 10-04 at 01:00, not
+    10-03 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Konstantin Hyppönen.)
+
+    Pacific/Pago_Pago has been changed from UT -11:30 to -11 for the
+    period from 1911 to 1950.
+
+    Pacific/Chatham has been changed to New Zealand standard time plus
+    45 minutes for the period before 1957, reflecting a 1956 remark in
+    the New Zealand parliament.
+
+    Europe/Budapest has several pre-1946 corrections: in 1918 the transition
+    out of DST was on 09-16, not 09-29; in 1919 it was on 11-24, not 09-15; in
+    1945 it was on 11-01, not 11-03; in 1941 the transition to DST was 04-08
+    not 04-06 at 02:00; and there was no DST in 1920.
+
+    Africa/Accra is now assumed to have observed DST from 1920 through 1935.
+
+    Time in Russia before 1927 or so has been corrected by a few seconds in
+    the following zones: Europe/Moscow, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Tbilisi,
+    Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yekaterinburg, Europe/Helsinki, and
+    Europe/Riga.  Also, Moscow's location has been changed to its Kilometer 0
+    point.  (Thanks to Vladimir Karpinsky for the Moscow changes.)
+
+  Changes affecting data format
+
+    A new file 'zone1970.tab' supersedes 'zone.tab' in the installed data.
+    The new file's extended format allows multiple country codes per zone.
+    The older file is still installed but is deprecated; its format is
+    not changing and it will still be distributed for a while, but new
+    applications should use the new file.
+
+    The new file format simplifies maintenance of obscure locations.
+    To test this, it adds coverage for the Crozet Islands and the
+    Scattered Islands.  (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Antoine Leca.)
+
+    The file 'iso3166.tab' is planned to switch from ASCII to UTF-8.
+    It is still ASCII now, but commentary about the switch has been added.
+    The new file 'zone1970.tab' already uses UTF-8.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    'localtime', 'mktime', etc. now use much less stack space if ALL_STATE
+    is defined.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes for reporting the problem.)
+
+    'zic' no longer mishandles input when ignoring case in locales that
+    are not compatible with English, e.g., unibyte Turkish locales when
+    compiled with HAVE_GETTEXT.
+
+    Error diagnostics of 'zic' and 'yearistype' have been reworded so that
+    they no longer use ASCII '-' as if it were a dash.
+
+    'zic' now rejects output file names that contain '.' or '..' components.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)
+
+    'zic -v' now warns about output file names that do not follow
+    POSIX rules, or that contain a digit or '.'.  (Thanks to Arthur
+    David Olson for starting the ball rolling on this.)
+
+    Some lint has been removed when using GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS with GCC 4.9.0.
+
+  Changes affecting build procedure
+
+    'zic' no longer links in localtime.o and asctime.o, as they're not needed.
+    (Thanks to John Cochran.)
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    The 'Theory' file documents legacy names, the longstanding
+    exceptions to the POSIX-inspired file name rules.
+
+    The 'zic' documentation clarifies the role of time types when
+    interpreting dates.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+    Documentation and commentary now prefer UTF-8 to US-ASCII,
+    allowing the use of proper accents in foreign words and names.
+    Code and data have not changed because of this.  (Thanks to
+    Garrett Wollman, Ian Abbott, and Guy Harris for helping to debug
+    this.)
+
+    Non-HTML documentation and commentary now use plain-text URLs instead of
+    HTML insertions, and are more consistent about bracketing URLs when they
+    are not already surrounded by white space.  (Thanks to suggestions by
+    Steffen Nurpmeso.)
+
+    There is new commentary about Xujiahui Observatory, the five time-zone
+    project in China from 1918 to 1949, timekeeping in Japanese-occupied
+    Shanghai, and Tibet Time in the 1950s.  The sharp-eyed can spot the
+    warlord Jin Shuren in the data.
+
+    Commentary about the coverage of each Russian zone has been standardized.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti).
+
+    There is new commentary about contemporary timekeeping in Ethiopia.
+
+    Obsolete comments about a 2007 proposal for DST in Kuwait has been removed.
+
+    There is new commentary about time in Poland in 1919.
+
+    Proper credit has been given to DST inventor George Vernon Hudson.
+
+    Commentary about time in Metlakatla, AK and Resolute, NU has been
+    improved, with a new source for the former.
+
+    In zone.tab, Pacific/Easter no longer mentions Salas y Gómez, as it
+    is uninhabited.
+
+    Commentary about permanent Antarctic bases has been updated.
+
+    Several typos have been corrected.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for
+    contributing some of these fixes.)
+
+    tz-link.htm now mentions the JavaScript libraries Moment Timezone,
+    TimezoneJS.Date, Walltime-js, and Timezone.  (Thanks to a heads-up
+    from Matt Johnson.)  Also, it mentions the Go 'latlong' package.
+    (Thanks to a heads-up from Dirkjan Ochtman.)
+
+    The files usno1988, usno1989, usno1989a, usno1995, usno1997, and usno1998
+    have been removed.  These obsolescent US Naval Observatory entries were no
+    longer helpful for maintenance.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for the suggestion.)
+
+
+Release 2014e - 2014-06-12 21:53:52 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    Egypt's 2014 Ramadan-based transitions are June 26 and July 31 at 24:00.
+    (Thanks to Imed Chihi.)  Guess that from 2015 on Egypt will temporarily
+    switch to standard time at 24:00 the last Thursday before Ramadan, and
+    back to DST at 00:00 the first Friday after Ramadan.
+
+    Similarly, Morocco's are June 28 at 03:00 and August 2 at 02:00.  (Thanks
+    to Milamber Space Network.)  Guess that from 2015 on Morocco will
+    temporarily switch to standard time at 03:00 the last Saturday before
+    Ramadan, and back to DST at 02:00 the first Saturday after Ramadan.
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    The abbreviation "MSM" (Moscow Midsummer Time) is now used instead of
+    "MSD" for Moscow's double daylight time in summer 1921.  Also, a typo
+    "VLASST" has been repaired to be "VLAST" for Vladivostok summer time
+    in 1991.  (Thanks to Hank W. for reporting the problems.)
+
+  Changes affecting commentary
+
+    tz-link.htm now cites RFC 7265 for jCal, mentions PTP and the
+    draft CalDAV extension, updates URLs for TSP, TZInfo, IATA, and
+    removes stale pointers to World Time Explorer and WORLDTIME.
+
+
+Release 2014d - 2014-05-27 21:34:40 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    zic no longer generates files containing time stamps before the Big Bang.
+    This works around GNOME bug 730332
+    <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730332>.
+    (Thanks to Leonardo Chiquitto for reporting the bug, and to
+    Arthur David Olson and James Cloos for suggesting improvements to the fix.)
+
+  Changes affecting documentation
+
+    tz-link.htm now mentions GNOME.
+
+
+Release 2014c - 2014-05-13 07:44:13 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    Egypt observes DST starting 2014-05-15 at 24:00.
+    (Thanks to Ahmad El-Dardiry and Gunther Vermier.)
+    Details have not been announced, except that DST will not be observed
+    during Ramadan.  Guess that DST will stop during the same Ramadan dates as
+    Morocco, and that Egypt's future spring and fall transitions will be the
+    same as 2010 when it last observed DST, namely April's last Friday at
+    00:00 to September's last Thursday at 23:00 standard time.  Also, guess
+    that Ramadan transitions will be at 00:00 standard time.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    zic now generates transitions for minimum time values, eliminating guesswork
+    when handling low-valued time stamps.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+    Port to Cygwin sans glibc.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+  Changes affecting commentary and documentation
+
+    Remove now-confusing comment about Jordan.  (Thanks to Oleksii Nochovnyi.)
+
+
+Release 2014b - 2014-03-24 21:28:50 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    Crimea switches to Moscow time on 2014-03-30 at 02:00 local time.
+    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)  Move its zone.tab entry from UA to RU.
+
+    New entry for Troll station, Antarctica.  (Thanks to Paul-Inge Flakstad and
+    Bengt-Inge Larsson.)  This is currently an approximation; a better version
+    will require the zic and localtime fixes mentioned below, and the plan is
+    to wait for a while until at least the zic fixes propagate.
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    'zic' and 'localtime' no longer reject locations needing four transitions
+    per year for the foreseeable future.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)
+    Also, 'zic' avoids some unlikely failures due to integer overflow.
+
+  Changes affecting build procedure
+
+    'make check' now detects Rule lines defined but never used.
+    The NZAQ rules, an instance of this problem, have been removed.
+
+  Changes affecting commentary and documentation
+
+    Fix Tuesday/Thursday typo in description of time in Israel.
+    (Thanks to Bert Katz via Pavel Kharitonov and Mike Frysinger.)
+
+    Microsoft Windows 8.1 doesn't support tz database names.  (Thanks
+    to Donald MacQueen.)  Instead, the Microsoft Windows Store app
+    library supports them.
+
+    Add comments about Johnston Island time in the 1960s.
+    (Thanks to Lyle McElhaney.)
+
+    Morocco's 2014 DST start will be as predicted.
+    (Thanks to Sebastien Willemijns.)
+
+
+Release 2014a - 2014-03-07 23:30:29 -0800
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    Turkey begins DST on 2014-03-31, not 03-30.  (Thanks to Faruk Pasin for
+    the heads-up, and to Tim Parenti for simplifying the update.)
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps
+
+    Fiji ended DST on 2014-01-19 at 02:00, not the previously-scheduled 03:00.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+    Ukraine switched from Moscow to Eastern European time on 1990-07-01
+    (not 1992-01-01), and observed DST during the entire next winter.
+    (Thanks to Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl.)
+
+    In 1988 Israel observed DST from 04-10 to 09-04, not 04-09 to 09-03.
+    (Thanks to Avigdor Finkelstein.)
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    A uninitialized-storage bug in 'localtime' has been fixed.
+    (Thanks to Logan Chien.)
+
+  Changes affecting the build procedure
+
+    The settings for 'make check_web' now default to Ubuntu 13.10.
+
+  Changes affecting commentary and documentation
+
+    The boundary of the US Pacific time zone is given more accurately.
+    (Thanks to Alan Mintz.)
+
+    Chile's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to José Miguel Garrido.)
+
+    Paraguay's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)
+
+    Better descriptions of countries with same time zone history as
+    Trinidad and Tobago since 1970.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for suggestion.)
+
+    Several changes affect tz-link.htm, the main web page.
+
+      Mention Time.is (thanks to Even Scharning) and WX-now (thanks to
+      David Braverman).
+
+      Mention xCal (Internet RFC 6321) and jCal.
+
+      Microsoft has some support for tz database names.
+
+      CLDR data formats include both XML and JSON.
+
+      Mention Maggiolo's map of solar vs standard time.
+      (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+      Mention TZ4Net.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)
+
+      Mention the timezone-olson Haskell package.
+
+      Mention zeitverschiebung.net.  (Thanks to Martin Jäger.)
+
+      Remove moribund links to daylight-savings-time.info and to
+      Simple Timer + Clocks.
+
+      Update two links.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen.)
+
+      Fix some formatting glitches, e.g., remove random newlines from

+
+
+Release 2013i - 2013-12-17 07:25:23 -0800
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps:
+
+    Jordan switches back to standard time at 00:00 on December 20, 2013.
+    The 2006-2011 transition schedule is planned to resume in 2014.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps:
+
+    In 2004, Cuba began DST on March 28, not April 4.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    The compile-time flag NOSOLAR has been removed, as nowadays the
+    benefit of slightly shrinking runtime table size is outweighed by the
+    cost of disallowing potential future updates that exceed old limits.
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    The files solar87, solar88, and solar89 are no longer distributed.
+    They were a negative experiment - that is, a demonstration that
+    tz data can represent solar time only with some difficulty and error.
+    Their presence in the distribution caused confusion, as Riyadh
+    civil time was generally not solar time in those years.
+
+    tz-link.htm now mentions Noda Time.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)
+
+
+Release 2013h - 2013-10-25 15:32:32 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:
+
+    Libya has switched its UT offset back to +02 without DST, instead
+    of +01 with DST.  (Thanks to Even Scharning.)
+
+    Western Sahara (Africa/El_Aaiun) uses Morocco's DST rules.
+    (Thanks to Gwillim Law.)
+
+  Changes affecting future time stamps:
+
+    Acre and (we guess) western Amazonas will switch from UT -04 to -05
+    on 2013-11-10.  This affects America/Rio_Branco and America/Eirunepe.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+    Add entries for DST transitions in Morocco in the year 2038.
+    This avoids some year-2038 glitches introduced in 2013g.
+    (Thanks to Yoshito Umaoka for reporting the problem.)
+
+  Changes affecting API
+
+    The 'tzselect' command no longer requires the 'select' command,
+    and should now work with /bin/sh on more platforms.  It also works
+    around a bug in BusyBox awk before version 1.21.0.  (Thanks to
+    Patrick 'P. J.' McDermott and Alan Barrett.)
+
+  Changes affecting code
+
+    Fix localtime overflow bugs with 32-bit unsigned time_t.
+
+    zdump no longer assumes sscanf returns maximal values on overflow.
+
+  Changes affecting the build procedure
+
+    The builder can specify which programs to use, if any, instead of
+    'ar' and 'ranlib', and libtz.a is now built locally before being
+    installed.  (Thanks to Michael Forney.)
+
+    A dependency typo in the 'zdump' rule has been fixed.
+    (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)
+
+    The Makefile has been simplified by assuming that 'mkdir -p' and 'cp -f'
+    work as specified by POSIX.2-1992 or later; this is portable nowadays.
+
+    'make clean' no longer removes 'leapseconds', since it's
+    host-independent and is part of the distribution.
+
+    The unused makefile macros TZCSRCS, TZDSRCS, DATESRCS have been removed.
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    tz-link.htm now mentions TC TIMEZONE's draft time zone service protocol
+    (thanks to Mike Douglass) and TimezoneJS.Date (thanks to Jim Fehrle).
+
+    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for Microsoft Windows, since
+    8.1 introduces tz support.  Remove URLs for Tru64 and UnixWare (no
+    longer maintained) and for old advisories.  SOFA now does C.
+
+Release 2013g - 2013-09-30 21:08:26 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting current and near-future time stamps
+
+    Morocco now observes DST from the last Sunday in March to the last
+    Sunday in October, not April to September respectively.  (Thanks
+    to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Changes affecting 'zic'
+
+    'zic' now runs on platforms that lack both hard links and symlinks.
+    (Thanks to Theo Veenker for reporting the problem, for MinGW.)
+    Also, fix some bugs on platforms that lack hard links but have symlinks.
+
+    'zic -v' again warns that Asia/Tehran has no POSIX environment variable
+    to predict the far future, fixing a bug introduced in 2013e.
+
+  Changes affecting the build procedure
+
+    The 'leapseconds' file is again put into the tzdata tarball.
+    Also, 'leapseconds.awk', so tzdata is self-contained.  (Thanks to
+    Matt Burgess and Ian Abbott.)  The timestamps of these and other
+    dependent files in tarballs are adjusted more consistently.
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    The README file is now part of the data tarball as well as the code.
+    It now states that files are public domain unless otherwise specified.
+    (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for asking for clarifications.)
+    Its details about the 1989 release moved to a place of honor near
+    the end of NEWS.
+
+
+Release 2013f - 2013-09-24 23:37:36 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    Tocantins will very likely not observe DST starting this spring.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+    Jordan will likely stay at UT +03 indefinitely, and will not fall
+    back this fall.
+
+    Palestine will fall back at 00:00, not 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Changes affecting API
+
+    The types of the global variables 'timezone' and 'altzone' (if present)
+    have been changed back to 'long'.  This is required for 'timezone'
+    by POSIX, and for 'altzone' by common practice, e.g., Solaris 11.
+    These variables were originally 'long' in the tz code, but were
+    mistakenly changed to 'time_t' in 1987; nobody reported the
+    incompatibility until now.  The difference matters on x32, where
+    'long' is 32 bits and 'time_t' is 64.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes.)
+
+  Changes affecting the build procedure
+
+    Avoid long strings in leapseconds.awk to work around a mawk bug.
+    (Thanks to Cyril Baurand.)
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    New file 'NEWS' that contains release notes like this one.
+
+    Paraguay's law does not specify DST transition time; 00:00 is customary.
+    (Thanks to Waldemar Villamayor-Venialbo.)
+
+    Minor capitalization fixes.
+
+  Changes affecting version-control only
+
+    The experimental GitHub repository now contains annotated and
+    signed tags for recent releases, e.g., '2013e' for Release 2013e.
+    Releases are tagged starting with 2012e; earlier releases were
+    done differently, and tags would either not have a simple name or
+    not exactly match what was released.
+
+    'make set-timestamps' is now simpler and a bit more portable.
+
+
+Release 2013e - 2013-09-19 23:50:04 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting near-future time stamps
+
+    This year Fiji will start DST on October 27, not October 20.
+    (Thanks to David Wheeler for the heads-up.)  For now, guess that
+    Fiji will continue to spring forward the Sunday before the fourth
+    Monday in October.
+
+  Changes affecting current and future time zone abbreviations
+
+    Use WIB/WITA/WIT rather than WIT/CIT/EIT for alphabetic Indonesian
+    time zone abbreviations since 1932.  (Thanks to George Ziegler,
+    Priyadi Iman Nurcahyo, Zakaria, Jason Grimes, Martin Pitt, and
+    Benny Lin.)  This affects Asia/Dili, Asia/Jakarta, Asia/Jayapura,
+    Asia/Makassar, and Asia/Pontianak.
+
+    Use ART (UT -03, standard time), rather than WARST (also -03, but
+    daylight saving time) for San Luis, Argentina since 2009.
+
+  Changes affecting Godthåb time stamps after 2037 if version mismatch
+
+    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where the transition time's hour can
+    range from -167 through 167, instead of the POSIX-required 0
+    through 24.  E.g., TZ='FJT-12FJST,M10.3.1/146,M1.3.4/75' for the
+    new Fiji rules.  This is a more-compact way to represent
+    far-future time stamps for America/Godthab, America/Santiago,
+    Antarctica/Palmer, Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron, Asia/Jerusalem,
+    Pacific/Easter, and Pacific/Fiji.  Other zones are unaffected by
+    this change.  (Derived from a suggestion by Arthur David Olson.)
+
+    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where daylight saving time is in
+    effect all year.  E.g., TZ='WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25' for Western
+    Argentina Summer Time all year.  This supports a more-compact way
+    to represent the 2013d data for America/Argentina/San_Luis.
+    Because of the change for San Luis noted above this change does not
+    affect the current data.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for
+    suggestions that improved this change.)
+
+    Where these two TZ changes take effect, there is a minor extension
+    to the tz file format in that it allows new values for the
+    embedded TZ-format string, and the tz file format version number
+    has therefore been increased from 2 to 3 as a precaution.
+    Version-2-based client code should continue to work as before for
+    all time stamps before 2038.  Existing version-2-based client code
+    (tzcode, GNU/Linux, Solaris) has been tested on version-3-format
+    files, and typically works in practice even for time stamps after
+    2037; the only known exception is America/Godthab.
+
+  Changes affecting time stamps before 1970
+
+    Pacific/Johnston is now a link to Pacific/Honolulu.  This corrects
+    some errors before 1947.
+
+    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differ from existing
+    zones only in older data entries that were likely invented or that
+    differ only in LMT or transitions from LMT.  These changes affect
+    only time stamps before 1943.  The affected zones are:
+    Africa/Juba, America/Anguilla, America/Aruba, America/Dominica,
+    America/Grenada, America/Guadeloupe, America/Marigot,
+    America/Montserrat, America/St_Barthelemy, America/St_Kitts,
+    America/St_Lucia, America/St_Thomas, America/St_Vincent,
+    America/Tortola, and Europe/Vaduz.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl for
+    confirming that the old Europe/Vaduz zone was wrong and the new
+    link is better for WWII-era times.)
+
+    Change Kingston Mean Time from -5:07:12 to -5:07:11.  This affects
+    America/Cayman, America/Jamaica and America/Grand_Turk time stamps
+    from 1890 to 1912.
+
+    Change the UT offset of Bern Mean Time from 0:29:44 to 0:29:46.
+    This affects Europe/Zurich time stamps from 1853 to 1894.  (Thanks
+    to Alois Treindl).
+
+    Change the date of the circa-1850 Zurich transition from 1849-09-12
+    to 1853-07-16, overriding Shanks with data from Messerli about
+    postal and telegraph time in Switzerland.
+
+  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations before 1970
+
+    For Asia/Jakarta, use BMT (not JMT) for mean time from 1923 to 1932,
+    as Jakarta was called Batavia back then.
+
+  Changes affecting API
+
+    The 'zic' command now outputs a dummy transition when far-future
+    data can't be summarized using a TZ string, and uses a 402-year
+    window rather than a 400-year window.  For the current data, this
+    affects only the Asia/Tehran file.  It does not affect any of the
+    time stamps that this file represents, so zdump outputs the same
+    information as before.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)
+
+    The 'date' command has a new '-r' option, which lets you specify
+    the integer time to display, a la FreeBSD.
+
+    The 'tzselect' command has two new options '-c' and '-n', which lets you
+    select a zone based on latitude and longitude.
+
+    The 'zic' command's '-v' option now warns about constructs that
+    require the new version-3 binary file format.  (Thanks to Arthur
+    David Olson for the suggestion.)
+
+    Support for floating-point time_t has been removed.
+    It was always dicey, and POSIX no longer requires it.
+    (Thanks to Eric Blake for suggesting to the POSIX committee to
+    remove it, and thanks to Alan Barrett, Clive D.W. Feather, Andy
+    Heninger, Arthur David Olson, and Alois Treindl, for reporting
+    bugs and elucidating some of the corners of the old floating-point
+    implementation.)
+
+    The signatures of 'offtime', 'timeoff', and 'gtime' have been
+    changed back to the old practice of using 'long' to represent UT
+    offsets.  This had been inadvertently and mistakenly changed to
+    'int_fast32_t'.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)
+
+    The code avoids undefined behavior on integer overflow in some
+    more places, including gmtime, localtime, mktime and zdump.
+
+  Changes affecting the zdump utility
+
+    zdump now outputs "UT" when referring to Universal Time, not "UTC".
+    "UTC" does not make sense for time stamps that predate the introduction
+    of UTC, whereas "UT", a more-generic term, does.  (Thanks to Steve Allen
+    for clarifying UT vs UTC.)
+
+  Data changes affecting behavior of tzselect and similar programs
+
+    Country code BQ is now called the more-common name "Caribbean Netherlands"
+    rather than the more-official "Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba".
+
+    Remove from zone.tab the names America/Montreal, America/Shiprock,
+    and Antarctica/South_Pole, as they are equivalent to existing
+    same-country-code zones for post-1970 time stamps.  The data entries for
+    these names are unchanged, so the names continue to work as before.
+
+  Changes affecting code internals
+
+    zic -c now runs way faster on 64-bit hosts when given large numbers.
+
+    zic now uses vfprintf to avoid allocating and freeing some memory.
+
+    tzselect now computes the list of continents from the data,
+    rather than have it hard-coded.
+
+    Minor changes pacify GCC 4.7.3 and GCC 4.8.1.
+
+  Changes affecting the build procedure
+
+    The 'leapseconds' file is now generated automatically from a
+    new file 'leap-seconds.list', which is a copy of
+    <ftp://time.nist.gov/pub/leap-seconds.list>.
+    A new source file 'leapseconds.awk' implements this.
+    The goal is simplification of the future maintenance of 'leapseconds'.
+
+    When building the 'posix' or 'right' subdirectories, if the
+    subdirectory would be a copy of the default subdirectory, it is
+    now made a symbolic link if that is supported.  This saves about
+    2 MB of file system space.
+
+    The links America/Shiprock and Antarctica/South_Pole have been
+    moved to the 'backward' file.  This affects only nondefault builds
+    that omit 'backward'.
+
+  Changes affecting version-control only
+
+    .gitignore now ignores 'date'.
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary
+
+    Changes to the 'tzfile' man page
+
+      It now mentions that the binary file format may be extended in
+      future versions by appending data.
+
+      It now refers to the 'zdump' and 'zic' man pages.
+
+    Changes to the 'zic' man page
+
+      It lists conditions that elicit a warning with '-v'.
+
+      It says that the behavior is unspecified when duplicate names
+      are given, or if the source of one link is the target of another.
+
+      Its examples are updated to match the latest data.
+
+      The definition of white space has been clarified slightly.
+      (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)
+
+    Changes to the 'Theory' file
+
+      There is a new section about the accuracy of the tz database,
+      describing the many ways that errors can creep in, and
+      explaining why so many of the pre-1970 time stamps are wrong or
+      misleading (thanks to Steve Allen, Lester Caine, and Garrett
+      Wollman for discussions that contributed to this).
+
+      The 'Theory' file describes LMT better (this follows a
+      suggestion by Guy Harris).
+
+      It refers to the 2013 edition of POSIX rather than the 2004 edition.
+
+      It's mentioned that excluding 'backward' should not affect the
+      other data, and it suggests at least one zone.tab name per
+      inhabited country (thanks to Stephen Colebourne).
+
+      Some longstanding restrictions on names are documented, e.g.,
+      'America/New_York' precludes 'America/New_York/Bronx'.
+
+      It gives more reasons for the 1970 cutoff.
+
+      It now mentions which time_t variants are supported, such as
+      signed integer time_t.  (Thanks to Paul Goyette for reporting
+      typos in an experimental version of this change.)
+
+      (Thanks to Philip Newton for correcting typos in these changes.)
+
+    Documentation and commentary is more careful to distinguish UT in
+    general from UTC in particular.  (Thanks to Steve Allen.)
+
+    Add a better source for the Zurich 1894 transition.
+    (Thanks to Pierre-Yves Berger.)
+
+    Update shapefile citations in tz-link.htm.  (Thanks to Guy Harris.)
+
+
+Release 2013d - 2013-07-05 07:38:01 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting future time stamps:
+
+    Morocco's midsummer transitions this year are July 7 and August 10,
+    not July 9 and August 8.  (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)
+
+    Israel now falls back on the last Sunday of October.
+    (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps:
+
+    Specify Jerusalem's location more precisely; this changes the pre-1880
+    times by 2 s.
+
+  Changing affecting metadata only:
+
+    Fix typos in the entries for country codes BQ and SX.
+
+  Changes affecting code:
+
+    Rework the code to fix a bug with handling Australia/Macquarie on
+    32-bit hosts (thanks to Arthur David Olson).
+
+    Port to platforms like NetBSD, where time_t can be wider than long.
+
+    Add support for testing time_t types other than the system's.
+    Run 'make check_time_t_alternatives' to try this out.
+    Currently, the tests fail for unsigned time_t;
+    this should get fixed at some point.
+
+  Changes affecting documentation and commentary:
+
+    Deemphasize the significance of national borders.
+
+    Update the zdump man page.
+
+    Remove obsolete NOID comment (thanks to Denis Excoffier).
+
+    Update several URLs and comments in the web pages.
+
+    Spelling fixes (thanks to Kevin Lyda and Jonathan Leffler).
+
+    Update URL for CLDR Zone->Tzid table (thanks to Yoshito Umaoka).
+
+
+Release 2013c - 2013-04-19 16:17:40 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:
+
+    Palestine observed DST starting March 29, 2013.  (Thanks to
+    Steffen Thorsen.)  From 2013 on, Gaza and Hebron both observe DST,
+    with the predicted rules being the last Thursday in March at 24:00
+    to the first Friday on or after September 21 at 01:00.
+
+    Assume that the recent change to Paraguay's DST rules is permanent,
+    by moving the end of DST to the 4th Sunday in March every year.
+    (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)
+
+  Changes affecting past time stamps:
+
+    Fix some historical data for Palestine to agree with that of
+    timeanddate.com, as follows:
+
+	  The spring 2008 change in Gaza and Hebron was on 00:00 Mar 28, not
+	  00:00 Apr 1.
+
+	  The fall 2009 change in Gaza and Hebron on Sep 4 was at 01:00, not
+	  02:00.
+
+	  The spring 2010 change in Hebron was 00:00 Mar 26, not 00:01 Mar 27.
+
+	  The spring 2011 change in Gaza was 00:01 Apr 1, not 12:01 Apr 2.
+
+	  The spring 2011 change in Hebron on Apr 1 was at 00:01, not 12:01.
+
+	  The fall 2011 change in Hebron on Sep 30 was at 00:00, not 03:00.
+
+    Fix times of habitation for Macquarie to agree with the Tasmania
+    Parks & Wildlife Service history, which indicates that permanent
+    habitation was 1899-1919 and 1948 on.
+
+  Changing affecting metadata only:
+
+    Macquarie Island is politically part of Australia, not Antarctica.
+    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi.)
+
+    Sort Macquarie more-consistently with other parts of Australia.
+    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)
+
+
+Release 2013b - 2013-03-10 22:33:40 -0700
+
+  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:
+
+    Haiti uses US daylight-saving rules this year, and presumably future years.
+    This changes time stamps starting today.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+    Paraguay will end DST on March 24 this year.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)  For now, assume it's just this year.
+
+    Morocco does not observe DST during Ramadan;
+    try to predict Ramadan in Morocco as best we can.
+    (Thanks to Erik Homoet for the heads-up.)
+
+  Changes affecting commentary:
+
+    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for webOS, BB10, iOS.
+    Update URL for Solaris.  Mention Internet RFC 6557.
+    Update Internet RFCs 2445->5545, 2822->5322.
+    Switch from FTP to HTTP for Internet RFCs.
+
+
+Release 2013a - 2013-02-27 09:20:35 -0800
+
+  Change affecting binary data format:
+
+    The zone offset at the end of version-2-format zone files is now
+    allowed to be 24:00, as per POSIX.1-2008.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:
+
+    Chile's 2013 rules, and we guess rules for 2014 and later, will be
+    the same as 2012, namely Apr Sun>=23 03:00 UTC to Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.
+    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Robert Elz.)
+
+    New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.
+    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Arthur David Olson.)
+
+  Many changes affect historical time stamps before 1940.
+  These were deduced from: Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899
+  Feb;13(2):173-94 <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359>.
+
+  Changes affecting the code:
+
+    Fix zic bug that mishandled Egypt's 2010 changes (this also affected
+    the data).  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+    Fix localtime bug when time_t is unsigned and data files were generated
+    by a signed time_t system.  (Thanks to Doug Bailey for reporting and
+    to Arthur David Olson for fixing.)
+
+    Allow the email address for bug reports to be set by the packager.
+    The default is tz@iana.org, as before.  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)
+
+    Update HTML checking to be compatible with Ubuntu 12.10.
+
+    Check that files are a safe subset of ASCII.  At some point we may
+    relax this requirement to a safe subset of UTF-8.  Without the
+    check, some non-UTF-8 encodings were leaking into the distribution.
+
+  Commentary changes:
+
+    Restore a comment about copyright notices that was inadvertently deleted.
+    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+    Improve the commentary about which districts observe what times
+    in Russia.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen and Arthur David Olson).
+
+    Add web page links to tz.js.
+
+    Add "Run by the Monkeys" to tz-art.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)
+
+
+Release 2012j - 2012-11-12 18:34:49 -0800
+
+  Libya moved to CET this weekend, but with DST planned next year.
+  (Thanks to Even Scharning, Steffen Thorsen, and Tim Parenti.)
+
+  Signatures now have the extension .asc, not .sign, as that's more
+  standard.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock.)
+
+  The output of 'zdump --version', and of 'zic --version', now
+  uses a format that is more typical for --version.
+  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)
+
+  The output of 'tzselect --help', 'zdump --help', and 'zic --help'
+  now uses tz@iana.org rather than the old elsie address.
+
+  zic -v now complains about abbreviations that are less than 3
+  or more than 6 characters, as per Posix.  Formerly, it checked
+  for abbreviations that were more than 3.
+
+  'make public' no longer puts its temporary directory under /tmp,
+  and uses the just-built zic rather than the system zic.
+
+  Various fixes to documentation and commentary.
+
+
+Release 2012i - 2012-11-03 12:57:09 -0700
+
+  Cuba switches from DST tomorrow at 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Linker flags can now be specified via LDFLAGS.
+  AWK now defaults to 'awk', not 'nawk'.
+  The shell in tzselect now defaults to /bin/bash, but this can
+  be overridden by specifying KSHELL.
+  The main web page now mentions the unofficial GitHub repository.
+  (Thanks to Mike Frysinger.)
+
+  Tarball signatures can now be built by running 'make signatures'.
+  There are also new makefile rules 'tarballs', 'check_public', and
+  separate makefile rules for each tarball and signature file.
+  A few makefile rules are now more portable to strict POSIX.
+
+  The main web page now lists the canonical IANA URL.
+
+
+Release 2012h - 2012-10-26 22:49:10 -0700
+
+  Bahia no longer has DST.  (Thanks to Kelley Cook.)
+
+  Tocantins has DST.  (Thanks to Rodrigo Severo.)
+
+  Israel has new DST rules next year.  (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)
+
+  Jordan stays on DST this winter.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Web page updates.
+
+  More C modernization, except that at Arthur David Olson's suggestion
+  the instances of 'register' were kept.
+
+
+Release 2012g - 2012-10-17 20:59:45 -0700
+
+  Samoa fall 2012 and later.  (Thanks to Nicholas Pereira and Robert Elz.)
+
+  Palestine fall 2012.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
+
+  Assume C89.
+
+  To attack the version-number problem, this release ships the file
+  'Makefile' (which contains the release number) in both the tzcode and
+  the tzdata tarballs.  The two Makefiles are identical, and should be
+  identical in any matching pair of tarballs, so it shouldn't matter
+  which order you extract the tarballs.  Perhaps we can come up with a
+  better version-number scheme at some point; this scheme does have the
+  virtue of not adding more files.
+
+
+Release 2012f - 2012-09-12 23:17:03 -0700

+Release code2012c-data2012d - 2012-07-19 16:35:33 -0700
+
+  Changes for Morocco's time stamps, which take effect in a couple of
+  hours, along with infrastructure changes to accommodate how the tz
+  code and data are released on IANA.
+
+
+Release data2012c - 2012-03-27 12:17:25 -0400
+
+  africa
+	Summer time changes for Morocco (to start late April 2012)
+
+  asia
+	Changes for 2012 for Gaza & the West Bank (Hebron) and Syria
+
+  northamerica
+	Haiti following US/Canada rules for 2012 (and we're assuming,
+	for now anyway, for the future).
+
+
+Release 2012b - 2012-03-02 12:29:15 +0700
+
+  There is just one change to tzcode2012b (compared with 2012a):
+  the Makefile that was accidentally included with 2012a has been
+  replaced with the version that should have been there, which is
+  identical with the previous version (from tzcode2011i).
+
+  There are just two changes in tzdata2012b compared with 2012a.
+
+  Most significantly, summer time in Cuba has been delayed 3 weeks
+  (now starts April 1 rather than March 11).   Since Mar 11 (the old start
+  date, as listed in 2012a) is just a little over a week away, this
+  change is urgent.
+
+  Less importantly, an excess tab in one of the changes in zone.tab
+  in 2012a has been removed.
+
+
+Release 2012a - 2012-03-01 18:28:10 +0700
+
+  The changes in tzcode2012a (compared to the previous version, 2011i)
+  are entirely to the README and tz-art.htm and tz-link.htm files, if
+  none of those concern you, you can ignore the code update.  The changes
+  reflect the changed addresses for the mailing list and the code and
+  data distribution points & methods (and a link to DateTime::TimeZone::Tzfile
+  has been added to tz-link.htm).
+
+  In tzdata2012a (compared to the previous release, which was 2011n)
+  the major changes are:
+	Chile 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 summer time date adjustments.
+	Falkland Islands onto permanent summer time (we're assuming for the
+		foreseeable future, though 2012 is all we're fairly certain of.)
+	Armenia has abolished Summer Time.
+	Tokelau jumped the International Date Line back last December
+		(just the same as their near neighbour, Samoa).
+	America/Creston is a new zone for a small area of British Columbia
+	There will be a leapsecond 2012-06-30 23:59:60 UTC.
+
+  Other minor changes are:
+	Corrections to 1918 Canadian summer time end dates.
+	Updated URL for UK time zone history (in comments)
+	A few typos in Le Corre's list of free French place names (comments)
+
+
+Release data2011n - 2011-10-30 14:57:54 +0700
+
+  There are three changes of note - most urgently, Cuba (America/Havana)
+  has extended summer time by two weeks, now to end on Nov 13, rather than
+  the (already past) Oct 30.   Second, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic
+  (Europe/Tiraspol) decided not to split from the rest of Moldova after
+  all, and consequently that zone has been removed (again) and reinstated
+  in the "backward" file as a link to Europe/Chisinau.   And third, the
+  end date for Fiji's summer time this summer was moved forward from the
+  earlier planned Feb 26, to Jan 22.
+
+  Apart from that, Moldova (MD) returns to a single entry in zone.tab
+  (and the incorrect syntax that was in the 2011m version of that file
+  is so fixed - it would have been fixed in a different way had this
+  change not happened - that's the "missing" sccs version id).
+
+
+Release data2011m - 2011-10-24 21:42:16 +0700
+
+  In particular, the typos in comments in the data (2011-11-17 should have
+  been 2011-10-17 as Alan Barrett noted, and spelling of Tiraspol that
+  Tim Parenti noted) have been fixed, and the change for Ukraine has been
+  made in all 4 Ukrainian zones, rather than just Kiev (again, thanks to
+  Tim Parenti, and also Denys Gavrysh)
+
+  In addition, I added Europe/Tiraspol to zone.tab.
+
+  This time, all the files have new version numbers...  (including the files
+  otherwise unchanged in 2011m that were changed in 2011l but didn't get new
+  version numbers there...)
+
+
+Release data2011l - 2011-10-10 11:15:43 +0700
+
+  There are just 2 changes that cause different generated tzdata files from
+  zic, to Asia/Hebron and Pacific/Fiji - the possible change for Bahia, Brazil
+  is included, but commented out.  Compared with the diff I sent out last week,
+  this version also includes attributions for the sources for the changes
+  (in much the same format as ado used, but the html tags have not been
+  checked, verified, or used in any way at all, so if there are errors there,
+  please let me know.)

+Release 1999e - 1999-08-17 15:20:54 -0400
+
+  changes circulated by Paul Eggert, although the change to handling
+  of DST-specifying time zone names has been commented out for now

+

+
+  The Makefile's "make public" rule has also been changed to do a test

+
+  minor changes to put "TZif" at the start of each time zone information file
+
+  a rule has also been added to the Makefile so you can

+
+Release code1996m-data1996l - 1996-11-05 14:00:12 -0500
+
+  No functional changes here; the files have simply been changed to

+  [tzcode96f.tar.gz + tzdata96g.tar.gz are both missing!]
+
+  The changes get us some of the way to fixing the problems noted in Paul
+  Eggert's letter yesterday (in addition to a few others).  The approach
+  has been to make zic a bit smarter about figuring out what time zone
+  abbreviations apply just after the time specified in the "UNTIL" part
+  of a zone line.  Putting the smarts in zic means avoiding having
+  transition times show up in both "Zone" lines and "Rule" lines, which
+  in turn avoids multiple transition time entries in time zone files.
+  (This also makes the zic input files such as "europe" a bit shorter and
+  should ease maintenance.)
+
+
+Release data96f - 1996-04-19 19:20:03 -0000
+  [tzdata96f.tar.gz is missing!]
+

+
+
+Release code95i-data95m - 1995-12-21 12:46:47 -0500
+
+  The latest revisions from Paul Eggert are included, the usno1995

+
+  For Canada/Central, guess that the Sun customer's "one week too

+

+
+  The files:

+  *	incorporate the table changes by Paul Eggert;
+
+  *	include (and document) support for universal time specifications in
+	data files - but do not (yet) include use of this feature in the
+	data files.
+
+  Think of this as "TZ Classic" - the software has been set up not to break if

+  left as is so as not to break existing implementations.

+
+
+Release 94b - 1994-02-07 10:04:33 -0500
+
+  work by Paul Eggert who notes:
+
+  I found another book of time zone histories by E W Whitman; it's not
+  as extensive as Shanks but has a few goodies of its own.  I used it
+  to update the tables.  I also fixed some more as a result of
+  correspondence with Adam David and Peter Ilieve, and move some stray
+  links from 'europe' to 'backward'.  I corrected some scanning errors
+  in usno1989.
+
+  As far as the code goes, I fixed zic to allow years in the range
+  INT_MIN to INT_MAX; this fixed a few boundary conditions around 1900.
+  And I cleaned up the zic documentation a little bit.
+
+
+Release data94a - 1994-02-03 08:58:54 -0500

+  It simply incorporates the recently announced leap second into the

+
+
+Release 93g - 1993-11-22 17:28:27 -0500
+
+  Paul Eggert has provided a good deal of historic information (based
+  on Shanks), and there are some code changes to deal with the buglets
+  that crawled out in dealing with the new information.
+
+
+Release 93f - 1993-10-15 12:27:46 -0400
+

+

+
+  This has updated data for Israel, England, and Kwajalein.  There's

+
+  updated "leapseconds" file
+
+
+Release 93 - 1993-01-08 07:01:06 -0500
+
+  At kre's suggestion, the package has been split in two - a code piece
+  (which also includes documentation) that's only of use to folks who
+  want to recompile things and a data piece useful to anyone who can
+  run "zic".
+
+  The new version has a few changes to the data files, a few
+  portability changes, and an off-by-one fix (with thanks to
+  Tom Karzes at deshaw.com for providing a description and a
+  solution).
+
+
+Release 92c - 1992-11-21 17:35:36 -0000
+  [tz92c.tar.Z is missing!]
+
+  The fallout from the latest round of DST transitions.
+
+  There are changes for Portugal, Saskatchewan, and "Pacific-New";
+  there's also a change to "zic.c" that makes it portable to more systems.
+
+
+Release 92 - 1992-04-25 18:17:03 -0000
+  [tz92.tar.Z is missing!]
+
+  By popular demand (well, at any rate, following a request by kre at munnari)
+
+
+The 1989 update of the time zone package featured:
+
+  *	POSIXization (including interpretation of POSIX-style TZ environment
+	variables, provided by Guy Harris),
+  *	ANSIfication (including versions of "mktime" and "difftime"),
+  *	SVIDulation (an "altzone" variable)
+  *	MACHination (the "gtime" function)
+  *	corrections to some time zone data (including corrections to the rules
+	for Great Britain and New Zealand)
+  *	reference data from the United States Naval Observatory for folks who
+	want to do additional time zones
+  *	and the 1989 data for Saudi Arabia.
+
+  (Since this code will be treated as "part of the implementation" in some
+  places and as "part of the application" in others, there's no good way to
+  name functions, such as timegm, that are not part of the proposed ANSI C
+  standard; such functions have kept their old, underscore-free names in this
+  update.)
+
+  And the "dysize" function has disappeared; it was present to allow
+  compilation of the "date" command on old BSD systems, and a version of "date"
+  is now provided in the package.  The "date" command is not created when you
+  "make all" since it may lack options provided by the version distributed with
+  your operating system, or may not interact with the system in the same way
+  the native version does.
+
+  Since POSIX frowns on correct leap second handling, the default behavior of
+  the "zic" command (in the absence of a "-L" option) has been changed to omit
+  leap second information from its output files.

+Notes
+
+This file contains copies of the part of each release announcement
+that talks about the changes in that release.  The text has been
+adapted and reformatted for the purposes of this file.
+
+Traditionally a release R consists of a pair of tarball files,
+tzcodeR.tar.gz and tzdataR.tar.gz.  However, some releases (e.g.,
+code2010a, data2012c) consist of just one or the other tarball, and a
+few (e.g., code2012c-data2012d) have tarballs with mixed version
+numbers.  Recent releases also come in an experimental format
+consisting of a single tarball tzdb-R.tar.lz with extra data.
+
+Release time stamps are taken from the release's commit (for newer,
+Git-based releases), from the newest file in the tarball (for older
+releases, where this info is available) or from the email announcing
+the release (if all else fails; these are marked with a time zone of
+-0000 and an "is missing!" comment).
+
+Earlier versions of the code and data were not announced on the tz
+list and are not summarized here.

+"What time is it?" -- Richard Deacon as The King

+
+The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and
+data that represent the history of local time for many representative
+locations around the globe.  It is updated periodically to reflect
+changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets,
+and daylight-saving rules.
+
+Here is a recipe for acquiring, building, installing, and testing the
+tz distribution on a GNU/Linux or similar host.
+
+To acquire the distribution, run the following shell commands:
+
+	mkdir tz
+	cd tz
+	wget --retr-symlinks 'ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tz*-latest.tar.gz'
+	gzip -dc tzcode-latest.tar.gz | tar -xf -
+	gzip -dc tzdata-latest.tar.gz | tar -xf -
+
+Alternatively, the following shell commands acquire the same
+distribution, with extra data useful for regression testing:
+
+	wget --retr-symlinks 'ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdb-latest.tar.lz'
+	lzip -dc tzdb-latest.tar.lz | tar -xf -
+
+Be sure to read the comments in "Makefile" and make any changes needed
+to make things right for your system, especially if you are using some
+platform other than GNU/Linux.  Then run the following commands,
+substituting your desired installation directory for "$HOME/tzdir":
+
+	make TOPDIR=$HOME/tzdir install
+	$HOME/tzdir/etc/zdump -v America/Los_Angeles
+
+Historical local time information has been included here to:
+
+*	provide a compendium of data about the history of civil time
+	that is useful even if not 100% accurate;
+
+*	give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
+	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
+	expected in the future;
+
+*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
+	system.
+
+The information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;
+fixes and enhancements are welcome.  Please see the file CONTRIBUTING
+for details.
+
+Thanks to these Time Zone Caballeros who've made major contributions to the
+time conversion package: Keith Bostic; Bob Devine; Paul Eggert; Robert Elz;
+Guy Harris; Mark Horton; John Mackin; and Bradley White.  Thanks also to
+Michael Bloom, Art Neilson, Stephen Prince, John Sovereign, and Frank Wales
+for testing work, and to Gwillim Law for checking local mean time data.

+
+
+----- Scope of the tz database -----
+
+The tz database attempts to record the history and predicted future of
+all computer-based clocks that track civil time.  To represent this
+data, the world is partitioned into regions whose clocks all agree
+about time stamps that occur after the somewhat-arbitrary cutoff point
+of the POSIX Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).  For each such region,
+the database records all known clock transitions, and labels the region
+with a notable location.  Although 1970 is a somewhat-arbitrary
+cutoff, there are significant challenges to moving the cutoff earlier
+even by a decade or two, due to the wide variety of local practices
+before computer timekeeping became prevalent.
+
+Clock transitions before 1970 are recorded for each such location,
+because most systems support time stamps before 1970 and could
+misbehave if data entries were omitted for pre-1970 transitions.
+However, the database is not designed for and does not suffice for
+applications requiring accurate handling of all past times everywhere,
+as it would take far too much effort and guesswork to record all
+details of pre-1970 civil timekeeping.
+
+As described below, reference source code for using the tz database is
+also available.  The tz code is upwards compatible with POSIX, an
+international standard for UNIX-like systems.  As of this writing, the
+current edition of POSIX is:
+
+  The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7
+  IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition
+  <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>
+
+
+
+----- Names of time zone rules -----
+
+Each of the database's time zone rules has a unique name.
+Inexperienced users are not expected to select these names unaided.
+Distributors should provide documentation and/or a simple selection
+interface that explains the names; for one example, see the 'tzselect'
+program in the tz code.  The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository
+<http://cldr.unicode.org/> contains data that may be useful for other
+selection interfaces.
+
+The time zone rule naming conventions attempt to strike a balance
+among the following goals:
+
+ * Uniquely identify every region where clocks have agreed since 1970.
+   This is essential for the intended use: static clocks keeping local
+   civil time.
+
+ * Indicate to experts where that region is.
+
+ * Be robust in the presence of political changes.  For example, names
+   of countries are ordinarily not used, to avoid incompatibilities
+   when countries change their name (e.g. Zaire->Congo) or when
+   locations change countries (e.g. Hong Kong from UK colony to
+   China).
+
+ * Be portable to a wide variety of implementations.
+
+ * Use a consistent naming conventions over the entire world.
+
+Names normally have the form AREA/LOCATION, where AREA is the name
+of a continent or ocean, and LOCATION is the name of a specific
+location within that region.  North and South America share the same
+area, 'America'.  Typical names are 'Africa/Cairo', 'America/New_York',
+and 'Pacific/Honolulu'.
+
+Here are the general rules used for choosing location names,
+in decreasing order of importance:
+
+	Use only valid POSIX file name components (i.e., the parts of
+		names other than '/').  Do not use the file name
+		components '.' and '..'.  Within a file name component,
+		use only ASCII letters, '.', '-' and '_'.  Do not use
+		digits, as that might create an ambiguity with POSIX
+		TZ strings.  A file name component must not exceed 14
+		characters or start with '-'.  E.g., prefer 'Brunei'
+		to 'Bandar_Seri_Begawan'.  Exceptions: see the discussion
+		of legacy names below.
+	A name must not be empty, or contain '//', or start or end with '/'.
+	Do not use names that differ only in case.  Although the reference
+		implementation is case-sensitive, some other implementations
+		are not, and they would mishandle names differing only in case.
+	If one name A is an initial prefix of another name AB (ignoring case),
+		then B must not start with '/', as a regular file cannot have
+		the same name as a directory in POSIX.  For example,
+		'America/New_York' precludes 'America/New_York/Bronx'.
+	Uninhabited regions like the North Pole and Bouvet Island
+		do not need locations, since local time is not defined there.
+	There should typically be at least one name for each ISO 3166-1
+		officially assigned two-letter code for an inhabited country
+		or territory.
+	If all the clocks in a region have agreed since 1970,
+		don't bother to include more than one location
+		even if subregions' clocks disagreed before 1970.
+		Otherwise these tables would become annoyingly large.
+	If a name is ambiguous, use a less ambiguous alternative;
+		e.g. many cities are named San José and Georgetown, so
+		prefer 'Costa_Rica' to 'San_Jose' and 'Guyana' to 'Georgetown'.
+	Keep locations compact.  Use cities or small islands, not countries
+		or regions, so that any future time zone changes do not split
+		locations into different time zones.  E.g. prefer 'Paris'
+		to 'France', since France has had multiple time zones.
+	Use mainstream English spelling, e.g. prefer 'Rome' to 'Roma', and
+		prefer 'Athens' to the Greek 'Αθήνα' or the Romanized 'Athína'.
+		The POSIX file name restrictions encourage this rule.
+	Use the most populous among locations in a zone,
+		e.g. prefer 'Shanghai' to 'Beijing'.  Among locations with
+		similar populations, pick the best-known location,
+		e.g. prefer 'Rome' to 'Milan'.
+	Use the singular form, e.g. prefer 'Canary' to 'Canaries'.
+	Omit common suffixes like '_Islands' and '_City', unless that
+		would lead to ambiguity.  E.g. prefer 'Cayman' to
+		'Cayman_Islands' and 'Guatemala' to 'Guatemala_City',
+		but prefer 'Mexico_City' to 'Mexico' because the country
+		of Mexico has several time zones.
+	Use '_' to represent a space.
+	Omit '.' from abbreviations in names, e.g. prefer 'St_Helena'
+		to 'St._Helena'.
+	Do not change established names if they only marginally
+		violate the above rules.  For example, don't change
+		the existing name 'Rome' to 'Milan' merely because
+		Milan's population has grown to be somewhat greater
+		than Rome's.
+	If a name is changed, put its old spelling in the 'backward' file.
+		This means old spellings will continue to work.
+
+The file 'zone1970.tab' lists geographical locations used to name time
+zone rules.  It is intended to be an exhaustive list of names for
+geographic regions as described above; this is a subset of the names
+in the data.  Although a 'zone1970.tab' location's longitude
+corresponds to its LMT offset with one hour for every 15 degrees east
+longitude, this relationship is not exact.
+
+Older versions of this package used a different naming scheme,
+and these older names are still supported.
+See the file 'backward' for most of these older names
+(e.g., 'US/Eastern' instead of 'America/New_York').
+The other old-fashioned names still supported are
+'WET', 'CET', 'MET', and 'EET' (see the file 'europe').
+
+Older versions of this package defined legacy names that are
+incompatible with the first rule of location names, but which are
+still supported.  These legacy names are mostly defined in the file
+'etcetera'.  Also, the file 'backward' defines the legacy names
+'GMT0', 'GMT-0', 'GMT+0' and 'Canada/East-Saskatchewan', and the file
+'northamerica' defines the legacy names 'EST5EDT', 'CST6CDT',
+'MST7MDT', and 'PST8PDT'.
+
+Excluding 'backward' should not affect the other data.  If
+'backward' is excluded, excluding 'etcetera' should not affect the
+remaining data.
+
+
+----- Time zone abbreviations -----
+
+When this package is installed, it generates time zone abbreviations
+like 'EST' to be compatible with human tradition and POSIX.
+Here are the general rules used for choosing time zone abbreviations,
+in decreasing order of importance:
+
+	Use three or more characters that are ASCII alphanumerics or '+' or '-'.
+		Previous editions of this database also used characters like
+		' ' and '?', but these characters have a special meaning to
+		the shell and cause commands like
+			set `date`
+		to have unexpected effects.
+		Previous editions of this rule required upper-case letters,
+		but the Congressman who introduced Chamorro Standard Time
+		preferred "ChST", so lower-case letters are now allowed.
+		Also, POSIX from 2001 on relaxed the rule to allow '-', '+',
+		and alphanumeric characters from the portable character set
+		in the current locale.  In practice ASCII alphanumerics and
+		'+' and '-' are safe in all locales.
+
+		In other words, in the C locale the POSIX extended regular
+		expression [-+[:alnum:]]{3,} should match the abbreviation.
+		This guarantees that all abbreviations could have been
+		specified by a POSIX TZ string.
+
+	Use abbreviations that are in common use among English-speakers,
+		e.g. 'EST' for Eastern Standard Time in North America.
+		We assume that applications translate them to other languages
+		as part of the normal localization process; for example,
+		a French application might translate 'EST' to 'HNE'.
+
+	For zones whose times are taken from a city's longitude, use the
+		traditional xMT notation, e.g. 'PMT' for Paris Mean Time.
+		The only name like this in current use is 'GMT'.
+
+	Use 'LMT' for local mean time of locations before the introduction
+		of standard time; see "Scope of the tz database".
+
+	If there is no common English abbreviation, use numeric offsets like
+		-05 and +0830 that are generated by zic's %z notation.
+
+    [The remaining guidelines predate the introduction of %z.
+    They are problematic as they mean tz data entries invent
+    notation rather than record it.  These guidelines are now
+    deprecated and the plan is to gradually move to %z for
+    inhabited locations and to "-00" for uninhabited locations.]
+
+	If there is no common English abbreviation, abbreviate the English
+		translation of the usual phrase used by native speakers.
+		If this is not available or is a phrase mentioning the country
+		(e.g. "Cape Verde Time"), then:
+
+		When a country is identified with a single or principal zone,
+			append 'T' to the country's ISO	code, e.g. 'CVT' for
+			Cape Verde Time.  For summer time append 'ST';
+			for double summer time append 'DST'; etc.
+		Otherwise, take the first three letters of an English place
+			name identifying each zone and append 'T', 'ST', etc.
+			as before; e.g. 'VLAST' for VLAdivostok Summer Time.
+
+	Use UT (with time zone abbreviation '-00') for locations while
+		uninhabited.  The leading '-' is a flag that the time
+		zone is in some sense undefined; this notation is
+		derived from Internet RFC 3339.
+
+Application writers should note that these abbreviations are ambiguous
+in practice: e.g. 'CST' has a different meaning in China than
+it does in the United States.  In new applications, it's often better
+to use numeric UT offsets like '-0600' instead of time zone
+abbreviations like 'CST'; this avoids the ambiguity.
+
+
+----- Accuracy of the tz database -----
+
+The tz database is not authoritative, and it surely has errors.
+Corrections are welcome and encouraged; see the file CONTRIBUTING.
+Users requiring authoritative data should consult national standards
+bodies and the references cited in the database's comments.
+
+Errors in the tz database arise from many sources:
+
+ * The tz database predicts future time stamps, and current predictions
+   will be incorrect after future governments change the rules.
+   For example, if today someone schedules a meeting for 13:00 next
+   October 1, Casablanca time, and tomorrow Morocco changes its
+   daylight saving rules, software can mess up after the rule change
+   if it blithely relies on conversions made before the change.
+
+ * The pre-1970 entries in this database cover only a tiny sliver of how
+   clocks actually behaved; the vast majority of the necessary
+   information was lost or never recorded.  Thousands more zones would
+   be needed if the tz database's scope were extended to cover even
+   just the known or guessed history of standard time; for example,
+   the current single entry for France would need to split into dozens
+   of entries, perhaps hundreds.  And in most of the world even this
+   approach would be misleading due to widespread disagreement or
+   indifference about what times should be observed.  In her 2015 book
+   "The Global Transformation of Time, 1870-1950", Vanessa Ogle writes
+   "Outside of Europe and North America there was no system of time
+   zones at all, often not even a stable landscape of mean times,
+   prior to the middle decades of the twentieth century".  See:
+   Timothy Shenk, Booked: A Global History of Time. Dissent 2015-12-17
+   https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/booked-a-global-history-of-time-vanessa-ogle
+
+ * Most of the pre-1970 data entries come from unreliable sources, often
+   astrology books that lack citations and whose compilers evidently
+   invented entries when the true facts were unknown, without
+   reporting which entries were known and which were invented.
+   These books often contradict each other or give implausible entries,
+   and on the rare occasions when they are checked they are
+   typically found to be incorrect.
+
+ * For the UK the tz database relies on years of first-class work done by
+   Joseph Myers and others; see <http://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/>.
+   Other countries are not done nearly as well.
+
+ * Sometimes, different people in the same city would maintain clocks
+   that differed significantly.  Railway time was used by railroad
+   companies (which did not always agree with each other),
+   church-clock time was used for birth certificates, etc.
+   Often this was merely common practice, but sometimes it was set by law.
+   For example, from 1891 to 1911 the UT offset in France was legally
+   0:09:21 outside train stations and 0:04:21 inside.
+
+ * Although a named location in the tz database stands for the
+   containing region, its pre-1970 data entries are often accurate for
+   only a small subset of that region.  For example, Europe/London
+   stands for the United Kingdom, but its pre-1847 times are valid
+   only for locations that have London's exact meridian, and its 1847
+   transition to GMT is known to be valid only for the L&NW and the
+   Caledonian railways.
+
+ * The tz database does not record the earliest time for which a zone's
+   data entries are thereafter valid for every location in the region.
+   For example, Europe/London is valid for all locations in its
+   region after GMT was made the standard time, but the date of
+   standardization (1880-08-02) is not in the tz database, other than
+   in commentary.  For many zones the earliest time of validity is
+   unknown.
+
+ * The tz database does not record a region's boundaries, and in many
+   cases the boundaries are not known.  For example, the zone
+   America/Kentucky/Louisville represents a region around the city of
+   Louisville, the boundaries of which are unclear.
+
+ * Changes that are modeled as instantaneous transitions in the tz
+   database were often spread out over hours, days, or even decades.
+
+ * Even if the time is specified by law, locations sometimes
+   deliberately flout the law.
+
+ * Early timekeeping practices, even assuming perfect clocks, were
+   often not specified to the accuracy that the tz database requires.
+
+ * Sometimes historical timekeeping was specified more precisely
+   than what the tz database can handle.  For example, from 1909 to
+   1937 Netherlands clocks were legally UT +00:19:32.13, but the tz
+   database cannot represent the fractional second.
+
+ * Even when all the timestamp transitions recorded by the tz database
+   are correct, the tz rules that generate them may not faithfully
+   reflect the historical rules.  For example, from 1922 until World
+   War II the UK moved clocks forward the day following the third
+   Saturday in April unless that was Easter, in which case it moved
+   clocks forward the previous Sunday.  Because the tz database has no
+   way to specify Easter, these exceptional years are entered as
+   separate tz Rule lines, even though the legal rules did not change.
+
+ * The tz database models pre-standard time using the proleptic Gregorian
+   calendar and local mean time (LMT), but many people used other
+   calendars and other timescales.  For example, the Roman Empire used
+   the Julian calendar, and had 12 varying-length daytime hours with a
+   non-hour-based system at night.
+
+ * Early clocks were less reliable, and data entries do not represent
+   this unreliability.
+
+ * As for leap seconds, civil time was not based on atomic time before
+   1972, and we don't know the history of earth's rotation accurately
+   enough to map SI seconds to historical solar time to more than
+   about one-hour accuracy.  See: Morrison LV, Stephenson FR.
+   Historical values of the Earth's clock error Delta T and the
+   calculation of eclipses. J Hist Astron. 2004;35:327-36
+   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004JHA....35..327M>;
+   Historical values of the Earth's clock error. J Hist Astron. 2005;36:339
+   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005JHA....36..339M>.
+
+ * The relationship between POSIX time (that is, UTC but ignoring leap
+   seconds) and UTC is not agreed upon after 1972.  Although the POSIX
+   clock officially stops during an inserted leap second, at least one
+   proposed standard has it jumping back a second instead; and in
+   practice POSIX clocks more typically either progress glacially during
+   a leap second, or are slightly slowed while near a leap second.
+
+ * The tz database does not represent how uncertain its information is.
+   Ideally it would contain information about when data entries are
+   incomplete or dicey.  Partial temporal knowledge is a field of
+   active research, though, and it's not clear how to apply it here.
+
+In short, many, perhaps most, of the tz database's pre-1970 and future
+time stamps are either wrong or misleading.  Any attempt to pass the
+tz database off as the definition of time should be unacceptable to
+anybody who cares about the facts.  In particular, the tz database's
+LMT offsets should not be considered meaningful, and should not prompt
+creation of zones merely because two locations differ in LMT or
+transitioned to standard time at different dates.
+
+
+----- Time and date functions -----
+
+The tz code contains time and date functions that are upwards
+compatible with those of POSIX.
+
+POSIX has the following properties and limitations.
+
+*	In POSIX, time display in a process is controlled by the
+	environment variable TZ.  Unfortunately, the POSIX TZ string takes
+	a form that is hard to describe and is error-prone in practice.
+	Also, POSIX TZ strings can't deal with other (for example, Israeli)
+	daylight saving time rules, or situations where more than two
+	time zone abbreviations are used in an area.
+
+	The POSIX TZ string takes the following form:
+
+		stdoffset[dst[offset][,date[/time],date[/time]]]
+
+	where:
+
+	std and dst
+		are 3 or more characters specifying the standard
+		and daylight saving time (DST) zone names.
+		Starting with POSIX.1-2001, std and dst may also be
+		in a quoted form like "<UTC+10>"; this allows
+		"+" and "-" in the names.
+	offset
+		is of the form '[+-]hh:[mm[:ss]]' and specifies the
+		offset west of UT.  'hh' may be a single digit; 0<=hh<=24.
+		The default DST offset is one hour ahead of standard time.
+	date[/time],date[/time]
+		specifies the beginning and end of DST.  If this is absent,
+		the system supplies its own rules for DST, and these can
+		differ from year to year; typically US DST rules are used.
+	time
+		takes the form 'hh:[mm[:ss]]' and defaults to 02:00.
+		This is the same format as the offset, except that a
+		leading '+' or '-' is not allowed.
+	date
+		takes one of the following forms:
+		Jn (1<=n<=365)
+			origin-1 day number not counting February 29
+		n (0<=n<=365)
+			origin-0 day number counting February 29 if present
+		Mm.n.d (0[Sunday]<=d<=6[Saturday], 1<=n<=5, 1<=m<=12)
+			for the dth day of week n of month m of the year,
+			where week 1 is the first week in which day d appears,
+			and '5' stands for the last week in which day d appears
+			(which may be either the 4th or 5th week).
+			Typically, this is the only useful form;
+			the n and Jn forms are rarely used.
+
+	Here is an example POSIX TZ string, for US Pacific time using rules
+	appropriate from 1987 through 2006:
+
+		TZ='PST8PDT,M4.1.0/02:00,M10.5.0/02:00'
+
+	This POSIX TZ string is hard to remember, and mishandles time stamps
+	before 1987 and after 2006.  With this package you can use this
+	instead:
+
+		TZ='America/Los_Angeles'
+
+*	POSIX does not define the exact meaning of TZ values like "EST5EDT".
+	Typically the current US DST rules are used to interpret such values,
+	but this means that the US DST rules are compiled into each program
+	that does time conversion.  This means that when US time conversion
+	rules change (as in the United States in 1987), all programs that
+	do time conversion must be recompiled to ensure proper results.
+
+*	The TZ environment variable is process-global, which makes it hard
+	to write efficient, thread-safe applications that need access
+	to multiple time zones.
+
+*	In POSIX, there's no tamper-proof way for a process to learn the
+	system's best idea of local wall clock.  (This is important for
+	applications that an administrator wants used only at certain times -
+	without regard to whether the user has fiddled the "TZ" environment
+	variable.  While an administrator can "do everything in UTC" to get
+	around the problem, doing so is inconvenient and precludes handling
+	daylight saving time shifts - as might be required to limit phone
+	calls to off-peak hours.)
+
+*	POSIX provides no convenient and efficient way to determine the UT
+	offset and time zone abbreviation of arbitrary time stamps,
+	particularly for time zone settings that do not fit into the
+	POSIX model.
+
+*	POSIX requires that systems ignore leap seconds.
+
+*	The tz code attempts to support all the time_t implementations
+	allowed by POSIX.  The time_t type represents a nonnegative count of
+	seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, ignoring leap seconds.
+	In practice, time_t is usually a signed 64- or 32-bit integer; 32-bit
+	signed time_t values stop working after 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, so
+	new implementations these days typically use a signed 64-bit integer.
+	Unsigned 32-bit integers are used on one or two platforms,
+	and 36-bit and 40-bit integers are also used occasionally.
+	Although earlier POSIX versions allowed time_t to be a
+	floating-point type, this was not supported by any practical
+	systems, and POSIX.1-2013 and the tz code both require time_t
+	to be an integer type.
+
+These are the extensions that have been made to the POSIX functions:
+
+*	The "TZ" environment variable is used in generating the name of a file
+	from which time zone information is read (or is interpreted a la
+	POSIX); "TZ" is no longer constrained to be a three-letter time zone
+	name followed by a number of hours and an optional three-letter
+	daylight time zone name.  The daylight saving time rules to be used
+	for a particular time zone are encoded in the time zone file;
+	the format of the file allows U.S., Australian, and other rules to be
+	encoded, and allows for situations where more than two time zone
+	abbreviations are used.
+
+	It was recognized that allowing the "TZ" environment variable to
+	take on values such as "America/New_York" might cause "old" programs
+	(that expect "TZ" to have a certain form) to operate incorrectly;
+	consideration was given to using some other environment variable
+	(for example, "TIMEZONE") to hold the string used to generate the
+	time zone information file name.  In the end, however, it was decided
+	to continue using "TZ": it is widely used for time zone purposes;
+	separately maintaining both "TZ" and "TIMEZONE" seemed a nuisance;
+	and systems where "new" forms of "TZ" might cause problems can simply
+	use TZ values such as "EST5EDT" which can be used both by
+	"new" programs (a la POSIX) and "old" programs (as zone names and
+	offsets).
+
+*	The code supports platforms with a UT offset member in struct tm,
+	e.g., tm_gmtoff.
+
+*	The code supports platforms with a time zone abbreviation member in
+	struct tm, e.g., tm_zone.
+
+*	Since the "TZ" environment variable can now be used to control time
+	conversion, the "daylight" and "timezone" variables are no longer
+	needed.  (These variables are defined and set by "tzset"; however, their
+	values will not be used by "localtime.")
+
+*	Functions tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz, and mktime_z for
+	more-efficient thread-safe applications that need to use
+	multiple time zones.  The tzalloc and tzfree functions
+	allocate and free objects of type timezone_t, and localtime_rz
+	and mktime_z are like localtime_r and mktime with an extra
+	timezone_t argument.  The functions were inspired by NetBSD.
+
+*	A function "tzsetwall" has been added to arrange for the system's
+	best approximation to local wall clock time to be delivered by
+	subsequent calls to "localtime."  Source code for portable
+	applications that "must" run on local wall clock time should call
+	"tzsetwall();" if such code is moved to "old" systems that don't
+	provide tzsetwall, you won't be able to generate an executable program.
+	(These time zone functions also arrange for local wall clock time to be
+	used if tzset is called - directly or indirectly - and there's no "TZ"
+	environment variable; portable applications should not, however, rely
+	on this behavior since it's not the way SVR2 systems behave.)
+
+*	Negative time_t values are supported, on systems where time_t is signed.
+
+*	These functions can account for leap seconds, thanks to Bradley White.
+
+Points of interest to folks with other systems:
+
+*	Code compatible with this package is already part of many platforms,
+	including GNU/Linux, Android, the BSDs, Chromium OS, Cygwin, AIX, iOS,
+	BlackBery 10, macOS, Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, and Solaris.
+	On such hosts, the primary use of this package
+	is to update obsolete time zone rule tables.
+	To do this, you may need to compile the time zone compiler
+	'zic' supplied with this package instead of using the system 'zic',
+	since the format of zic's input is occasionally extended,
+	and a platform may still be shipping an older zic.
+
+*	The UNIX Version 7 "timezone" function is not present in this package;
+	it's impossible to reliably map timezone's arguments (a "minutes west
+	of GMT" value and a "daylight saving time in effect" flag) to a
+	time zone abbreviation, and we refuse to guess.
+	Programs that in the past used the timezone function may now examine
+	tzname[localtime(&clock)->tm_isdst] to learn the correct time
+	zone abbreviation to use.  Alternatively, use
+	localtime(&clock)->tm_zone if this has been enabled.
+
+*	The 4.2BSD gettimeofday function is not used in this package.
+	This formerly let users obtain the current UTC offset and DST flag,
+	but this functionality was removed in later versions of BSD.
+
+*	In SVR2, time conversion fails for near-minimum or near-maximum
+	time_t values when doing conversions for places that don't use UT.
+	This package takes care to do these conversions correctly.
+	A comment in the source code tells how to get compatibly wrong
+	results.
+
+The functions that are conditionally compiled if STD_INSPIRED is defined
+should, at this point, be looked on primarily as food for thought.  They are
+not in any sense "standard compatible" - some are not, in fact, specified in
+*any* standard.  They do, however, represent responses of various authors to
+standardization proposals.
+
+Other time conversion proposals, in particular the one developed by folks at
+Hewlett Packard, offer a wider selection of functions that provide capabilities
+beyond those provided here.  The absence of such functions from this package
+is not meant to discourage the development, standardization, or use of such
+functions.  Rather, their absence reflects the decision to make this package
+contain valid extensions to POSIX, to ensure its broad acceptability.  If
+more powerful time conversion functions can be standardized, so much the
+better.
+
+
+----- Interface stability -----
+
+The tz code and data supply the following interfaces:
+
+ * A set of zone names as per "Names of time zone rules" above.
+
+ * Library functions described in "Time and date functions" above.
+
+ * The programs tzselect, zdump, and zic, documented in their man pages.
+
+ * The format of zic input files, documented in the zic man page.
+
+ * The format of zic output files, documented in the tzfile man page.
+
+ * The format of zone table files, documented in zone1970.tab.
+
+ * The format of the country code file, documented in iso3166.tab.
+
+When these interfaces are changed, an effort is made to preserve
+backward compatibility.  For example, tz data files typically do not
+rely on recently-added zic features, so that users can run older zic
+versions to process newer data files.
+
+Interfaces not listed above are less stable.  For example, users
+should not rely on particular UT offsets or abbreviations for time
+stamps, as data entries are often based on guesswork and these guesses
+may be corrected or improved.
+
+
+----- Calendrical issues -----
+
+Calendrical issues are a bit out of scope for a time zone database,
+but they indicate the sort of problems that we would run into if we
+extended the time zone database further into the past.  An excellent
+resource in this area is Nachum Dershowitz and Edward M. Reingold,
+Calendrical Calculations: Third Edition, Cambridge University Press (2008)
+<http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/third-edition/>.

+
+In 1700, Denmark made the transition from Julian to Gregorian.  Sweden
+decided to *start* a transition in 1700 as well, but rather than have one of
+those unsightly calendar gaps :-), they simply decreed that the next leap
+year after 1696 would be in 1744 - putting the whole country on a calendar
+different from both Julian and Gregorian for a period of 40 years.
+
+However, in 1704 something went wrong and the plan was not carried through;
+they did, after all, have a leap year that year.  And one in 1708.  In 1712
+they gave it up and went back to Julian, putting 30 days in February that
+year!...
+
+Then in 1753, Sweden made the transition to Gregorian in the usual manner,
+getting there only 13 years behind the original schedule.
+

+
+----- Time and time zones on Mars -----
+
+Some people's work schedules use Mars time.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+(JPL) coordinators have kept Mars time on and off at least since 1997
+for the Mars Pathfinder mission.  Some of their family members have
+also adapted to Mars time.  Dozens of special Mars watches were built
+for JPL workers who kept Mars time during the Mars Exploration
+Rovers mission (2004).  These timepieces look like normal Seikos and
+Citizens but use Mars seconds rather than terrestrial seconds.
+
+A Mars solar day is called a "sol" and has a mean period equal to
+about 24 hours 39 minutes 35.244 seconds in terrestrial time.  It is
+divided into a conventional 24-hour clock, so each Mars second equals
+about 1.02749125 terrestrial seconds.
+
+The prime meridian of Mars goes through the center of the crater
+Airy-0, named in honor of the British astronomer who built the
+Greenwich telescope that defines Earth's prime meridian.  Mean solar
+time on the Mars prime meridian is called Mars Coordinated Time (MTC).
+
+Each landed mission on Mars has adopted a different reference for
+solar time keeping, so there is no real standard for Mars time zones.
+For example, the Mars Exploration Rover project (2004) defined two
+time zones "Local Solar Time A" and "Local Solar Time B" for its two
+missions, each zone designed so that its time equals local true solar
+time at approximately the middle of the nominal mission.  Such a "time
+zone" is not particularly suited for any application other than the
+mission itself.
+
+Many calendars have been proposed for Mars, but none have achieved
+wide acceptance.  Astronomers often use Mars Sol Date (MSD) which is a
+sequential count of Mars solar days elapsed since about 1873-12-29
+12:00 GMT.
+
+The tz database does not currently support Mars time, but it is
+documented here in the hopes that support will be added eventually.

+# of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20" but I didn't found its
+# text.
+#
+# According to Izvestia newspaper No. 68 (23334) from 1991-03-20
+# (page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via
+# http://libinfo.org/index.php?id=58564) on 1991-03-31 at 2:00 during
+# transition to "summer" time:
+# Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
+# Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug
+# were to move clocks 1 hour forward.
+# Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
+# SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
+# of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
+# Other territories were to not move clocks.
+# When the "summer" time would end on 1991-09-29, clocks were to be
+# moved 1 hour backwards on the territory of the USSR excluding
+# Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
+#
+# Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
+# was one of such changes.
+#
+# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное время
+# claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
+# Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
+# were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
+# forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
+# (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
+# article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
+# move clocks.)
+#
+# This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
+# the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
+# to +04/+05. It's unclear how Kzyl-Orda oblast moved into the fifth
+# time belt. (By switching from +04/+05 to +05/+06 on 1991-09-29?) ...
+#
+# 1. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
+# from 1992-01-13 No. 28
+# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000028_
+# (text includes modification from the 1996 act)
+# introduced new rules for calculation of time, mirroring Russian
+# 1992-01-08 act.  It specified that time would be calculated
+# according to time belts plus extra hour ("decree time"), moved clocks
+# on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
+# 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
+# located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
+# border between them to be located east of Kustanay and Aktyubinsk
+# oblasts (notably including Turgai and Kzyl-Orda oblasts into the fifth
+# time belt).
+#
+# This means switch on 1992-01-19 at 2:00 from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for
+# Asia/Aqtau, Asia/Aqtobe, Asia/Oral, Atyrau and Kustanay oblasts; from
+# +05/+06 to +06/+07 for Asia/Almaty and Asia/Qyzylorda (and Arkalyk) [*]....

+# from 1992-03-27 No. 284
+# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000284_
+# cancels extra hour ("decree time") for Uralsk and Kzyl-Orda oblasts
+# since the last Sunday of March 1992, while keeping them in the fourth

+#
+# 3. Order of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan

+#
+# This means change from +05/+06 to +04/+05.

+# replaces the previous five documents.
+#
+# The only changes I noticed are in definition of the border between the
+# fourth and the fifth time belts.  They account for changes in spelling
+# and administrative division (splitting of Turgai oblast in 1997
+# probably changed time in territories incorporated into Kostanay oblast
+# (including Arkalyk) from +06/+07 to +05/+06) and move Kyzylorda oblast
+# from being in the fifth time belt and not using decree time into the

+# from 2004-07-20 No. 775
+# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P040000775_/20.07.2004
+# modified the 2000-11-23 act to move Kostanay and Kyzylorda oblasts into
+# the fifth time belt and add Aktobe oblast to the list of regions not
+# using extra hour ("decree time"), leaving Kazakhstan with only 2 time

+# from 2004-09-15 No. 1059

+# modified the 2000-11-23 act to remove exceptions from the "decree time"

+# Kostanay, Kyzylorda and Mangystau oblasts by not moving clocks
+# during the 2014 transition to "winter" time.
+#
+# This means transition from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for Atyrau oblast (no

 # as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.
 
-# From K Sethu (2006-04-25):
-# I think the abbreviation LKT originated from the world of computers at
-# the time of or subsequent to the time zone changes by SL Government
-# twice in 1996 and probably SL Government or its standardization
-# agencies never declared an abbreviation as a national standard.
-#
-# I recollect before the recent change the government announcements
-# mentioning it as simply changing Sri Lanka Standard Time or Sri Lanka
-# Time and no mention was made about the abbreviation.
-#
-# If we look at Sri Lanka Department of Government's "Official News
-# Website of Sri Lanka" ... http://www.news.lk/ we can see that they
-# use SLT as abbreviation in time stamp at the beginning of each news
-# item....
-#
-# Within Sri Lanka I think LKT is well known among computer users and
-# administrators.  In my opinion SLT may not be a good choice because the
-# nation's largest telcom / internet operator Sri Lanka Telcom is well
-# known by that abbreviation - simply as SLT (there IP domains are
-# slt.lk and sltnet.lk).
-#
-# But if indeed our government has adopted SLT as standard abbreviation
-# (that we have not known so far) then  it is better that it be used for
-# all computers.

-# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-25):
-# One possibility is that we wait for a bit for the dust to settle down
-# and then see what people actually say in practice.
+# From Sadika Sumanapala (2016-10-19):
+# According to http://www.sltime.org (maintained by Measurement Units,
+# Standards & Services Department, Sri Lanka) abbreviation for Sri Lanka
+# standard time is SLST.
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-18):
+# "SLST" seems to be reasonably recent and rarely-used outside time
+# zone nerd sources.  I searched Google News and found three uses of
+# it in the International Business Times of India in February and
+# March of this year when discussing cricket match times, but nothing
+# since then (though there has been a lot of cricket) and nothing in
+# other English-language news sources.  Our old abbreviation "LKT" is
+# even worse.  For now, let's use a numeric abbreviation; we can
+# switch to "SLST" if it catches on.

+# (1919-02-08) http://istmat.info/node/35567 established UT-based time
+# zones, and Decree No. 147 (1919-03-29) http://istmat.info/node/35854
+# specified a transition date of 1919-07-01, apparently at 00:00 UT.
+# No doubt only the Soviet-controlled regions switched on that date;
+# later transitions to UT-based time in other parts of Russia are
+# taken from what appear to be guesses by Shanks.
+# (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for pointers to the decrees.)

+# 11. Regions-violators, 1981-1982.
+# Wikipedia refers to
+# http://maps.monetonos.ru/maps/raznoe/Old_Maps/Old_Maps/Articles/022/3_1981.html
+# http://besp.narod.ru/nauka_1981_3.htm
+#
+# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn
+# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to
+# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the
+# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
+# time belt changes map).
+#
+# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
+# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
+# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
+# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
+# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
+# "time violators" (regions which were not using rules of the time
+# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
+# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was
+# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2
+# hour difference.)  Map depicting "time violators" before 1981-10-01
+# is also provided.
+#
+# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems
+# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not
+# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,
+# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,
+# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol
+# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,
+# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and
+# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky
+# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous
+# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end
+# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow
+# time.
+#
+# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
+# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers
+# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds
+# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky
+# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.
+#
+# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,
+# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.
+#
+# 12. Udmurtia
+# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i
+# Zhizn article hints at Izhevsk being on different time from
+# Kuybyshev before 1981-10-01. Udmurtia is not mentioned in the 1989 act.
+# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
+# implies Udmurtia was on Moscow time after 1982-04-01.
+# Wikipedia implies Udmurtia being on Moscow+1 until 1991.
+#
+# ...
+#
+# All Russian zones are supposed to have by default a -1 change at
+# 1991-03-31 2:00 (cancellation of the decree time in the USSR) and a +1
+# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).
+#
+# There were some exceptions, though.
+# Wikipedia says newspapers listed Astrakhan, Saratov, Kirov, Volgograd,
+# Izhevsk, Grozny, Kazan and Samara as such exceptions for the 1992
+# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some
+# lists found in the internet are quite wild.)
+#
+# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.
+# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091

+# In response:

+#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
+#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
+#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
+#     -- Ross, p 25
+#
+# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1

+#
+# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
+# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's

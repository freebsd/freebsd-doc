+# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
+# [undated and unknown publication location]
+# It says several things:
+#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
+#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
+#     the official calendar book of 1914.
+#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
+#     French docks in the 1890s, controled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
+#     Obervatory and set to local mean time.
+#   * "From the end of the 19th century" it changed to UT+8.
+#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
+#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
+#     became used by railways as well.
+#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
+#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
+#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
+#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
+#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
+#     Japanese-occupied territory.
+#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
+#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
+#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear
+#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
+#   * The People's Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
+#
+# An AP article "Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed" in the
+# Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said "Even the time is

+# Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
+# (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
+# 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
+# found on Wikisource:
+# http://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
+# ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
+# during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
+# declared officially.
+#
+# Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
+# Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 "The clause of
+# revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
+# time", in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
+# western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
+# territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
+# (UTC+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can

+# That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UTC+9 on Oct 1, 1937.
 
+# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
+# I've found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UTC+9
+# back to UTC+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
+# during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
+# zone back to Western Standard Time (UTC+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
+# history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
+# note "from today, switch back to Western Standard Time".  From these two
+# materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
+# today I have found another monthly journal called "The Astronomical Herald"
+# from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
+# that:
+#
+# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
+# the time at 135E (GMT+9)
+#
+# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
+# 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
+# as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
+# Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
+#
+# 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
+# territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
+# Time.

+# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-15):
+# Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
+# standardized until relatively recently; we don't know when, and possibly it
+# has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in "Islam city yielding to
+# modern times", New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
+# observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
+# time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o'clock (or to 12
+# o'clock for "Arab" time).
+#
+# The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
+# we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
+# Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the "... Arabian Government, inaugurated
+# a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
+# Jidda, on March 14, 1947".  Shanks & Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
+# earlier date.
+#
+# Shanks & Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
+# time zones; the other zone, at UTC+4, was in the far eastern part of
+# the country.  Ignore this, as it's before our 1970 cutoff.

-# I recently found this Australian government web page on time zones:
-# <http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-13time>
-# And this government web page lists time zone names and abbreviations:
-# <http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml>
-
-# From Paul Eggert (2001-04-05), summarizing a long discussion about "EST"
-# versus "AEST" etc.:
+# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 #
-# I see the following points of dispute:
+# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
+# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
+# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
+# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
+# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
+# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
+# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
+# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
+# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
+# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
+# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
+# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
 #
-# * How important are unique time zone abbreviations?
+#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
+#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
+#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
+#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
+#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
+#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
+#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
 #
-#   Here I tend to agree with the point (most recently made by Chris
-#   Newman) that unique abbreviations should not be essential for proper
-#   operation of software.  We have other instances of ambiguity
-#   (e.g. "IST" denoting both "Israel Standard Time" and "Indian
-#   Standard Time"), and they are not likely to go away any time soon.
-#   In the old days, some software mistakenly relied on unique
-#   abbreviations, but this is becoming less true with time, and I don't
-#   think it's that important to cater to such software these days.
+#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
+#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
 #
-#   On the other hand, there is another motivation for unambiguous
-#   abbreviations: it cuts down on human confusion.  This is
-#   particularly true for Australia, where "EST" can mean one thing for
-#   time T and a different thing for time T plus 1 second.
+# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
+# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
+# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
+# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
 #
-# * Does the relevant legislation indicate which abbreviations should be used?
+#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
+#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
 #
-#   Here I tend to think that things are a mess, just as they are in
-#   many other countries.  We Americans are currently disagreeing about
-#   which abbreviation to use for the newly legislated Chamorro Standard
-#   Time, for example.
+# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
+# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
+# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
+# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
+# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
+# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
+# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
 #
-#   Personally, I would prefer to use common practice; I would like to
-#   refer to legislation only for examples of common practice, or as a
-#   tiebreaker.
+# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
+# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
+# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
+# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
+# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
+# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
+# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
+# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
+# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
+# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
+# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
+# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
+# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
+# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
 #
-# * Do Australians more often use "Eastern Daylight Time" or "Eastern
-#   Summer Time"?  Do they typically prefix the time zone names with
-#   the word "Australian"?
+# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:
 #
-#   My own impression is that both "Daylight Time" and "Summer Time" are
-#   common and are widely understood, but that "Summer Time" is more
-#   popular; and that the leading "A" is also common but is omitted more
-#   often than not.  I just used AltaVista advanced search and got the
-#   following count of page hits:
+#   The Australian Government (2014-03-26)
+#   http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/time
+#   (This document was produced by the Department of Finance.)
+#   AEST ACST AWST AEDT ACDT

+#   Bureau of Meteorology (2012-11-08)
+#   http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml
+#   EST CST WST EDT CDT
 #
-#   Here "Summer" seems quite a bit more popular than "Daylight",
-#   particularly when we know the time zone is Australian and not US,
-#   say.  The "Australian" prefix seems to be popular for Eastern Summer
-#   Time, but unpopular for Eastern Daylight Time.

+#   EST CST WST (no abbreviations given for DST)
 #
-#   For abbreviations, tools like AltaVista are less useful because of
-#   ambiguity.  Many hits are not really time zones, unfortunately, and
-#   many hits denote US time zones and not Australian ones.  But here
-#   are the hit counts anyway:

+#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
+#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
+#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
+#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
+#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
+#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
 #
-#       7,539 "WST" and domain:au
-#          68 "AWST" and domain:au
-#
-#   This data suggest that Australians tend to omit the "A" prefix in
-#   practice.  The situation for "ST" versus "DT" is less clear, given
-#   the ambiguities involved.
-#
-# * How do Australians feel about the abbreviations in the tz database?
-#
-#   If you just count Australians on this list, I count 2 in favor and 3
-#   against.  One of the "against" votes (David Keegel) counseled delay,
-#   saying that both AEST/AEDT and EST/EST are widely used and
-#   understood in Australia.
+# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
+# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
+# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
+# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
+# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
+# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
+# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
+# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
+# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

+#	The following table shows the corrections that must

+#	are transmitted by almost all time services.
+#
+#	The first column shows an epoch as a number of seconds

+#	indicate the same epoch.) Both of these time stamp formats
+#	ignore the complexities of the time scales that were
+#	used before the current definition of UTC at the start
+#	of 1972. (See note 3 below.)
+#	The second column shows the number of seconds that
+#	must be added to UTC to compute TAI for any timestamp
+#	at or after that epoch. The value on each line is
+#	valid from the indicated initial instant until the
+#	epoch given on the next one or indefinitely into the
+#	future if there is no next line.
+#	(The comment on each line shows the representation of
+#	the corresponding initial epoch in the usual
+#	day-month-year format. The epoch always begins at
+#	00:00:00 UTC on the indicated day. See Note 5 below.)
+#
+#	Important notes:
+#
+#	1. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often referred to
+#	as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The GMT time scale is no
+#	longer used, and the use of GMT to designate UTC is
+#	discouraged.
+#
+#	2. The UTC time scale is realized by many national
+#	laboratories and timing centers. Each laboratory
+#	identifies its realization with its name: Thus
+#	UTC(NIST), UTC(USNO), etc. The differences among
+#	these different realizations are typically on the
+#	order of a few nanoseconds (i.e., 0.000 000 00x s)
+#	and can be ignored for many purposes. These differences
+#	are tabulated in Circular T, which is published monthly
+#	by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
+#	(BIPM). See www.bipm.fr for more information.
+#
+#	3. The current definition of the relationship between UTC
+#	and TAI dates from 1 January 1972. A number of different
+#	time scales were in use before that epoch, and it can be
+#	quite difficult to compute precise timestamps and time
+#	intervals in those "prehistoric" days. For more information,
+#	consult:
+#
+#		The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
+#		Ephemeris.
+#	or
+#		Terry Quinn, "The BIPM and the Accurate Measurement
+#		of Time," Proc. of the IEEE, Vol. 79, pp. 894-905,
+#		July, 1991.
+#
+#	4. The decision to insert a leap second into UTC is currently
+#	the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and
+#	Reference Systems Service. (The name was changed from the
+#	International Earth Rotation Service, but the acronym IERS
+#	is still used.)
+#
+#	Leap seconds are announced by the IERS in its Bulletin C.
+#
+#	See www.iers.org for more details.
+#
+#	Every national laboratory and timing center uses the
+#	data from the BIPM and the IERS to construct UTC(lab),
+#	their local realization of UTC.
+#
+#	Although the definition also includes the possibility
+#	of dropping seconds ("negative" leap seconds), this has
+#	never been done and is unlikely to be necessary in the
+#	foreseeable future.
+#
+#	5. If your system keeps time as the number of seconds since
+#	some epoch (e.g., NTP timestamps), then the algorithm for
+#	assigning a UTC time stamp to an event that happens during a positive
+#	leap second is not well defined. The official name of that leap
+#	second is 23:59:60, but there is no way of representing that time
+#	in these systems.
+#	Many systems of this type effectively stop the system clock for
+#	one second during the leap second and use a time that is equivalent
+#	to 23:59:59 UTC twice. For these systems, the corresponding TAI
+#	timestamp would be obtained by advancing to the next entry in the
+#	following table when the time equivalent to 23:59:59 UTC
+#	is used for the second time. Thus the leap second which
+#	occurred on 30 June 1972 at 23:59:59 UTC would have TAI
+#	timestamps computed as follows:
+#
+#	...
+#	30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
+#	30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785599,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
+#	1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600)		TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
+#	...
+#
+#	If your system realizes the leap second by repeating 00:00:00 UTC twice
+#	(this is possible but not usual), then the advance to the next entry
+#	in the table must occur the second time that a time equivalent to
+#	00:00:00 UTC is used. Thus, using the same example as above:
+#
+#	...
+#       30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599):		TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
+#       30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785600, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
+#       1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
+#	...
+#
+#	in both cases the use of timestamps based on TAI produces a smooth
+#	time scale with no discontinuity in the time interval. However,
+#	although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct in both
+#	methods, the second method is technically not correct because it adds
+#	the extra second to the wrong day.
+#
+#	This complexity would not be needed for negative leap seconds (if they
+#	are ever used). The UTC time would skip 23:59:59 and advance from
+#	23:59:58 to 00:00:00 in that case. The TAI offset would decrease by
+#	1 second at the same instant. This is a much easier situation to deal
+#	with, since the difficulty of unambiguously representing the epoch
+#	during the leap second does not arise.

+#
+#	where the first term converts seconds to days and the second

+#	The integer portion of the result is the integer MJD for that

+#	fraction of the day since 0 hours UTC. The conversion from day
+#	fraction to seconds or to hours, minutes, and seconds may involve
+#	rounding or truncation, depending on the method used in the
+#	computation.
+#
+#	The data in this file will be updated periodically as new leap

+#	This update procedure will be performed only when a new leap second

+#
+#	The following entry specifies the expiration date of the data
+#	in this file in units of seconds since the origin at the instant

+#	at least twice per year whether or not a new leap second is

+#	action (if any) is to be taken on 30 June and 31 December,
+#	respectively. (These are the customary effective dates for new
+#	leap seconds.) This expiration date will be identified by a
+#	unique pair of characters in columns 1 and 2 as shown below.
+#	In the unlikely event that a leap second is announced with an

+#	If an announcement by the IERS specifies that no leap second is

-# TZ zone descriptions
+# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
+# This file is intended as a backward-compatibility aid for older programs.
+# New programs should use zone1970.tab.  This file is like zone1970.tab (see
+# zone1970.tab's comments), but with the following additional restrictions:
 #
-# From Paul Eggert (1996-08-05):
+# 1.  This file contains only ASCII characters.
+# 2.  The first data column contains exactly one country code.
 #
-# This file contains a table with the following columns:
-# 1.  ISO 3166 2-character country code.  See /usr/share/misc/iso3166.
-# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the zone's principal location
-#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,
-#     either +-DDMM+-DDDMM or +-DDMMSS+-DDDMMSS,
-#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).
-# 3.  Zone name used in value of TZ environment variable.
-# 4.  Comments; present if and only if the country has multiple rows.
+# Because of (2), each row stands for an area that is the intersection
+# of a region identified by a country code and of a zone where civil
+# clocks have agreed since 1970; this is a narrower definition than
+# that of zone1970.tab.
 #
-# Columns are separated by a single tab.
-# The table is sorted first by country, then an order within the country that
-# (1) makes some geographical sense, and
-# (2) puts the most populous zones first, where that does not contradict (1).
+# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time
+# zone data appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended
+# to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.

      on interactive topics and sessions that reflect the interests of
      the attendees. The Cambridge devsummit is a slightly longer
      three-day event without associated conference, letting us hold
      more extended working groups, brainstorming sessions, and
      hacking on topics over several days. Past significant focuses
      have included virtualisation, network performance, sandboxing,
      tracing/debugging, packages and package security, teaching,
      non-x86 architectures such as ARM/MIPS/RISC-V, and
      testing.</description>

    <description>EuroBSDcon is the European annual technical
      conference gathering users and developers working on and with
      4.4BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) based operating systems
      family and related projects. EuroBSDcon gives the exceptional
      opportunity to learn about the latest news from the BSD world,
      witness contemporary deployment case studies, and meet
      personally other users and companies using BSD oriented
      technologies. EuroBSDcon is also a boiler plate for ideas,
      discussions and information exchange, which often turn into
      programming projects. The conference has always attracted active
      programmers, administrators and aspiring students, as well as IT
      companies at large, which found the conference a convenient and
      quality training option for its staff. We firmly believe that
      high profile education is vital to the future of technology, and
      hence greatly welcome students and young people to this regular
      meeting.</description>

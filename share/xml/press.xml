	  who has made an outstanding contribution to the free
	  software movement in the Cascadia region.  Michael Dexter
	  was chosen because his work with the Portland Linux/Unix
	  Group and the BSD community exemplified the type of unsung
	  community-building work that is so critical to the growth
	  of the free software movement.</p>

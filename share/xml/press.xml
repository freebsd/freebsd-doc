	<p>With over 400 volunteer devs at its helm, the FreeBSD
	  Project is a dynamic force that puts the control in
	  administrators' hands.  Project Committer Allan Jude has
	  been a fan of the project since 2002.  He discusses the
	  system's internal structure and the feature functionality
	  that drew him in &mdash; contributing to its documentation
	  and then to its development &mdash; and what he's working
	  on now, more than a decade later.</p>

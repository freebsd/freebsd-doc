$FreeBSD$

This is an instruction for use of the following files, which are used
for both of www/ and doc/ tree:

 mirrors.xml		database of FreeBSD mirror sites

 mirrors-local.xsl	stylesheet to create localized version of mirrors.xml.
 mirrors-master.xsl	"-master" is master, "-local" is slave.

 transtable.xml		word-by-word basis translation table

 transtable-local.xsl	stylesheet to copy and translate a xml document.
 transtable-master.xsl	"-master" is master, "-local" is slave.

* Notes for mirrors.xml maintainers

  The elements are sorted in alphabetical order when the documents
  are rendered.  So basically order of <entry> is not important, but
  <entry> with role="primary" will be handled specially.  Currently
  it is for the central servers and the primary mirror sites.

* Notes for doc/ and www/ maintainers including translation teams:

  Translators should not simply copy mirrors.xml, mirrors-*.xsl,
  transtable.xml, and transtable-*.xsl in share/xml to the
  language dependent directory.  Instead, create "skeleton" *.xsl,
  which just import the master stylesheet.  *-local.xsl in share/xml
  are "skeleton" for en_US.ISO8859-1, so you can start from these.
  See ja_JP.eucJP/ for example.

  Documents always use mirrors.xml in the language dependent directory.
  This file is dynamically generated from share/xml/mirrors.xml, and it
  is localized using transtable-local.xsl.  transtable-local.xsl refers
  transtable.xml, a translation table for translating country name and
  so on.  It should be in the language dependent directory, but if not exist,
  share/xml/transtable.xml (a dummy translation table) will be used.
  Similarly, if there is no mirrors-local.xsl in the language dependent
  directory, share/xml/mirrors-local.xsl will be used.

  That is:
                          share/xml           <langcode>/share/xml
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   mirrors.xml            master copy           dynamically generated
   mirrors-local.xsl      dummy                 this is used if exists
   mirrors-master.xsl     used from -local.xsl  should not exist
   transtable.xml         dummy                 this is used if exists
   transtable-local.xsl   dummy                 this is used if exists
   transtable-master.xsl  used from -local.xsl  should not exist
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  "dummy" means that it will be used when the localized version of it is
  not available.  So the translation teams copy the "dummy" files,
  and adjust them to the language (especially make sure "encoding" part).

  If you add a document using mirrors.xml, use ${XML_MIRRORS} in the
  Makefile.

# Major variables:
#
#	PATH		- The search path as interpreted by the shell.
#	CVSROOT		- Path to the FreeBSD CVS repository.
#	BUILDDIR	- Where the checked out copies of the files are stored.
#	DESTDIR		- Where the rendered copies should wind up.
#	LOGFILE		- Name of the log file to use (in $BUILDDIR).
#	BUILDARGS	- Arguments to pass to make(1) when {build,install}ing.
#	INSTARGS	- Arguments to pass to make(1) when installing.
#	WEBMAILTO	- Address to send mail to if the build fails.
#
#	subtrees	- List of directores in $BUILDDIR which are from CVS.
#
# Variables which are in uppercase are derived from the environment
# unless they don't exist, in which case a value suitable for

# changed without editing other parts of the script; thus, their value
# in the environment is ignored.

# Exit codes:
#
#	0	- success
#	1	- unknown failure
#	2	- failure in CVS operations
#	3	- failure in make operations

# Notes on the names of the release notes directories:
#
# - They weren't named the same way they will be on the web site
# (CURRENT, 4-STABLE) becuase that wouldn't make it obvious that they
# were release notes.
#
# - They weren't named after their path names in the repository
# (src/release/doc) because that doesn't play well with branches.
#
# - The '/doc' part is necessary because of the way doc.subdir.mk finds
# ${LANGCODE}.  It strips off the last component of ${.CURDIR} one by
# one and compares the last component to 'doc'.  When it finds it, it
# assumes that the directory right below that is the language code.
# This works fine if all the languages are in a directory called
# 'doc', and not at all if they aren't.

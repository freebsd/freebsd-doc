    <description>This year Beastie joins Tux on his tour in Vienna in
      May: another "DanuBSDCon" is coming to gather Central-European
      BSD people to meet!  The event features several BSD developers
      and enthusiasts to tell about their work, communicate with their
      fellows and reach their potential future partners.  As usual,
      there are no formalities, papers, registration or participation
      fee, however the invited folks are encouraged to give a brief
      talk about their favorite BSD-related topic.  The goal is to
      motivate everybody, especially university students to work with
      BSD systems.

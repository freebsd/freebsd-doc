      Dartware's flagship product, InterMapper, shows active maps that
      give a visual, real-time view of traffic flows through and
      between critical network devices and links.  The status windows
      permit you to be proactive as well as reactive by displaying the
      percentage of capacity being used by any link or device.
      InterMapper uses pings, SNMP, Web, SMTP, and dozens of
      built-in server probes to keep tabs on the critical parts of your
      network, and let you know when you have problems-even before your
      customers call.  When InterMapper detects a problem, it sends a
      notification to one or more responsible individuals.  These
      sounds, emails, pages and text messages can be delayed or
      repeated to establish escalation schedules.  InterMapper's
      auto-discovery and map-arrangement tools let you install and get
      it running in an hour or two.<br />A non-expiring, full-functional
      license that lets you monitor up to five devices can be obtained
      for free.  For more information, visit

      InterBase is The Perfect Embedded Database. Behind every great
      client/server application, you will find a great database and very
      possibly an embedded database. The hallmark of a great embedded
      database is its ability to empower applications and deliver
      information while remaining virtually invisible to the end user and
      requiring little or no attention from the database administrator.
      That database is InterBase. InterBase's Japanese partner, RIOS
      Corporation, is now offering a port of InterBase 4 for FreeBSD.
      Additional information is available at <a
      href="http://www.interbase.com">www.interbase.com</a> or directly

    <description>
      BinarySEC is an intelligent web application firewall.  It runs on
      FreeBSD as an Apache module either on i386 and amd64 architectures.
      Its artificial intelligence engine learns normal traffic received on a
      website or any web application (provided it uses Apache) and is then
      able to stop suspicious HTTP requests.  It has two modes: alert
      (suspicious traffic is just reported, not stopped) and blocking mode.
      The webmaster (or the admin) has the ability to make the AI engine learn
      normal traffic so that the profiles of these requests generate no more
      false positives.  After a few days, no more false alerts will appear,
      only suspicious traffic will have been blocked.  BinarySEC is a relevant
      tool to harden a web application.<br/>
      A free trial is available on our website.  It can be installed in a few
      minutes.  <a href="http://www.binarysec.com/page-eng-freetrial.html">Grab

<!-- XXX rel.current and u.rel.* should be available in doc/ -->
<!-- The currently released versions of FreeBSD.  This value is used to
     create some links on web sites and such, so do NOT change it until
     it's really release time.  When you update this, you should also
     update (at least) the following:

	- similar entity in the Handbook
	- similar entity in the Relnotes
	- releases/index.sgml has the date of the current release
	- the FAQ has links to the release FTP url
	- "versions supported" in security.sgml

     (If you're the release engineer, feel free to update this list with
     other doc-related things you had to do.  It'll save you time and
     trouble the next time around :-).)

     As of 5.0, we now have the concept of two different "currently"
     released versions (from two different development branches).  Use
     rel.* and u.rel.* for the "latest and greatest" version and
     rel2.* and u.rel2.* for the "conservative users" version.

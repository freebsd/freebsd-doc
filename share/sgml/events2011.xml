    <description>A new BSD-Day is approaching again to gather Central
      European BSD people to meet.  The event features developers so
      they can popularize their work and communicate with users and
      potential future partners.  There are no formalities, papers,
      registration or participation fee, however the invited developers
      are encouraged to give a brief talk about their favorite BSD-related
      topic.  The goal is to motivate everybody, especially university
      students to work with BSD systems.</description>

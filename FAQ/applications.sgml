      <heading>So, where are all the user applications?</heading>

      <p>Please take a look at <url url="../ports/"
      name="the ports page"> for info on software packages ported to
      FreeBSD.  The list currently tops 1800 and is growing daily, so come
      back to check often or subscribe to the <tt/freebsd-announce/
      <ref id="mailing" name="mailing list"> for periodic updates on new
      entries.

      <p>Most ports should be available for the 2.2, 3.x and 4.0
      branches, and many of them should work on 2.1.x systems as
      well.  Each time a FreeBSD release is made, a snapshot of the
      ports tree at the time of release in also included in the
      <tt>ports/</tt> directory.

      <p>We also support the concept of a ``package'', essentially no
      more than a gzipped binary distribution with a little extra
      intelligence embedded in it for doing whatever custom installation
      work is required.  A package can be installed and uninstalled
      again easily without having to know the gory details of which
      files it includes.

      <p>Use the package installation menu in <tt>/stand/sysinstall</tt>
      (under the post-configuration menu item) or invoke the
      <em>pkg_add(1)</em> command on the specific package files you're
      interested in installing.  Package files can usually be identified by
      their <em>.tgz</em> suffix and CDROM distribution people will have
      a <tt>packages/All</tt> directory on their CD which contains such
      files.  They can also be downloaded over the net for various versions
      of FreeBSD at the following locations:

      <descrip>
        <tag>for 2.2.8-release/2.2.8-stable</tag>
        <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-2.2.8/"
        name="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-2.2.8/">

        <tag>for 3.2-release/3.2-stable</tag>
        <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/"
        name="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-3-stable/">

        <tag>for 4.0-current</tag>
        <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-current/"
        name="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-current/">
      </descrip>

      <p>or your nearest local mirror site.

      <p>Note that all ports may not be available as packages since
      new ones are constantly being added.  It is always a good
      idea to check back periodically to see which packages are available
      at the <url url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/"
      name="ftp.freebsd.org"> master site.

      <heading>Where do I find libc.so.3.0?</heading>

      <p>You are trying to run a package for 2.2/3.x/4.0 on a 2.1.x
      system.  Please take a look at the previous section and get
      the correct port/package for your system.

        ghostscript gives lots of errors with my 386/486SX.<label id="emul">
      </heading>

      <p>You don't have a math co-processor, right?
      You will need to add the alternative math emulator to your kernel;
      you do this by adding the following to your kernel config file
      and it will be compiled in.

      <verb>
        options GPL_MATH_EMULATE
      </verb>

      <p><bf/NOTE/ You will need to remove the <tt/MATH&lowbar;EMULATE/
      option when you do this.

        When I run a SCO/iBCS2 application, it bombs on <tt/socksys/.
      </heading>

      <p>You first need to edit the <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>
      (or <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf(5)"
      name="/etc/rc.conf">) file in the last section to change the
      following variable to <tt/YES/:

      <verb>
        # Set to YES if you want ibcs2 (SCO) emulation loaded at startup
        ibcs2=NO
      </verb>

      <p>It will load the <htmlurl
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ibcs2" name="ibcs2">
      kernel module at startup.

      <p>You'll then need to set up /compat/ibcs2/dev to look like:

      <verb>
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         9 Oct 15 22:20 X0R@ -> /dev/null
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         7 Oct 15 22:20 nfsd@ -> socksys
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  wheel         0 Oct 28 12:02 null
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         9 Oct 15 22:20 socksys@ -> /dev/null
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   41,   1 Oct 15 22:14 spx
      </verb>

      <p>You just need socksys to go to <htmlurl
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?null(4)" name="/dev/null">
      to fake the open &amp; close. The code in -current will handle the
      rest.  This is much cleaner than the way it was done before.  If you
      want the <tt/spx/ driver for a local socket X connection, define
      <tt/SPX&lowbar;HACK/ when you compile the system.

        How do I configure INN (Internet News) for my machine?
      </heading>

      <p>After installing the inn package or port, an excellent place to
      start is <url url="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~barr/INN.html"
      name="Dave Barr's INN Page"> where you'll find the INN FAQ.

      <heading>What version of Microsoft FrontPage should I get?</heading>

      <p>Use the Port, Luke!  A pre-patched version of Apache is available
      in the ports tree.

      <heading>Does FreeBSD support Java?</heading>

      <p>Yes. Please see <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/java"

      <heading>Why can't I build this port on my 3.x-stable machine?</heading>

      <p>If you're running a FreeBSD version that lags significantly behind
      -current or -stable, you may need a ports upgrade kit from
      <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/ports"
      name="http://www.freebsd.org/ports">.  If you are up to date, then
      someone might have committed a change to the port which works for
      -current but which broke the port for -stable. Please submit a bug
      report on this with the <em>send-pr(1)</em> command, since the ports
      collection is supposed to work for both the -current and -stable
      branches.

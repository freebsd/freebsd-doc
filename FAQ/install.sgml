      <heading>Which file do I download to get FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>You generally need just one floppy image, the <em>floppies/boot.flp
      </em> file, which you image-copy onto a 1.44MB floppy and then boot from
      in order to download the rest (and the installation will manage your
      TCP/IP connection, deal with tapes, CDROMs, floppies, DOS
      partitions, whatever's necessary to get the rest of the bits
      installed).

      <p>If you need to download the distributions yourself (for a DOS
      filesystem install, for instance), below are some recommendations
      for distributions to grab:

      <itemize>
      <item> bin/<newline>
      <item> manpages/<newline>
      <item> compat*/<newline>
      <item> doc/ <newline>
      <item> src/ssys.* <newline>
      </itemize>

      <p>Full instructions on this procedure and a little bit more about
      installation issues in general can be found in the <url
      url="../handbook/install.html"
      name="Handbook entry on installing FreeBSD.">

      <heading>Help! The boot floppy image will not fit on a single floppy!
      </heading>
      <p>A 3.5 inch (1.44MB) floppy can accomodate 1474560 bytes of data.  
      The boot image is exactly 1474560 bytes in size.
      <p>Common mistakes when preparing the boot floppy are:
      <itemize>
      <item>Not downloading the floppy image in <tt>binary</tt> mode when
	using <tt>FTP</tt>.  
	<p>Some FTP clients default their transfer mode to <tt>ascii</tt>
	and attempt to change any end-of-line characters received to match 
	the conventions used by the client's system.
	This will almost invariably corrupt the boot image.  Check the
	size of the downloaded boot image:  if it is not <em>exactly</em> 
	that on the server, then the download process is suspect.
	<p>To workaround: type <tt>binary</tt> at the FTP command prompt 
	after getting connected to the server and before starting the 
	download of the image.
      <item>Using the DOS <tt>copy</tt> command (or equivalent GUI tool) to 
        transfer the boot image to floppy.
	<p>Programs like <tt>copy</tt> will not work as the boot 
	image has been created to be booted into directly.  The image has
	the complete content of the floppy, track for track, and is not
	meant to be placed on the floppy as a regular file.
	You have to transfer it to the floppy ``raw'', using the 
	low-level tools (e.g. <tt>fdimage</tt> or <tt>rawrite</tt>) 
	described in the <url url="../handbook/install.html" 
	name="installation guide to FreeBSD">.

    <sect1>
      <heading>What do I need in order to run FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>You'll need a 386 or better PC, with 5 MB or more of RAM and at
      least 60 MB of hard disk space.  It can run with a low end MDA
      graphics card but to run X11R6, a VGA or better video card is needed.

      <p>See also the section on <ref id="hardware"
      name="Hardware compatibility">

    <sect1>
      <heading>I have only 4 MB of RAM. Can I install FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>FreeBSD 2.1.7 was the last version of FreeBSD that could be installed
      on a 4MB system.  Newer versions of FreeBSD, like 2.2, need at least 5MB
      to install on a new system.

      <p>All versions of FreeBSD, including 3.0, will RUN in 4MB of ram, they
      just can't run the installation program in 4MB.  You can add
      extra memory for the install process, if you like, and then
      after the system is up and running, go back to 4MB.  Or you could
      always just swap your disk into a system which has >4MB, install onto
      it and then swap it back.

      <p>There are also situations in which FreeBSD 2.1.7 will not install
      in 4 MB.  To be exact: it does not install with 640 kB base + 3 MB
      extended memory.  If your motherboard can remap some of the ``lost''
      memory out of the 640kB to 1MB region, then you may still be able
      to get FreeBSD 2.1.7 up.

      <p>Try to go into your BIOS setup and look for a ``remap'' option.
      Enable it.  You may also have to disable ROM shadowing.

      <p>It may be easier to get 4 more MB just for the install. Build a
      custom kernel with only the options you need and then get the 4
      MB out again.

      <p>You may also install 2.0.5 and then upgrade your system to 2.1.7
      with the ``upgrade'' option of the 2.1.7 installation program.

      <p>After the installation, if you build a custom kernel, it will run
      in 4 MB. Someone has even succeeded in booting with 2 MB (the
      system was almost unusable though :-))

        How can I make my own custom install floppy?
      </heading>

      <p>Currently there's no way to *just* make a custom install floppy.
      You have to cut a whole new release, which will include your install
      floppy. There's some code in <tt>/usr/src/release/floppies/Makefile</tt>
      that's supposed to let you *just* make those floppies, but it's not
      really gelled yet.

      <p>To make a custom release, follow the instructions <ref id="custrel"
      name="here">.

      <heading>Can Windows 95 co-exist with FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>Install Windows 95 first, after that FreeBSD. FreeBSD's boot
      manager will then manage to boot Win95 and FreeBSD.  If you
      install Windows 95 second, it will boorishly overwrite your
      boot manager without even asking.  If that happens, see
      the next section.

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        Windows 95 killed my boot manager!  How do I get it back?
      </heading>

      <p>You can reinstall the boot manager FreeBSD comes with in one of
      two ways:

      <itemize>
        <item>Running DOS, go into the tools/ directory of your FreeBSD
        distribution and look for <bf>bootinst.exe</bf>.  You run it like so:

        <p><bf>bootinst.exe boot.bin</bf>

        <p>and the boot manager will be reinstalled.

        <item>Boot the FreeBSD boot floppy again and go to the Custom
        installation menu item.  Choose Partition.  Select the drive which
        used to contain your boot manager (likely the first one) and when you
        come to the partition editor for it, as the very first thing (e.g.
        do not make any changes) select (W)rite.  This will ask for
        confirmation, say yes, and when you get the Boot Manager selection
        prompt, be sure to select "Boot Manager."
        This will re-write the boot manager to disk.  Now quit out of the
        installation menu and reboot off the hard disk as normal.
      </itemize>

    <sect1>
      <heading>Can I install on a disk with bad blocks?</heading>

      <p>FreeBSD's bad block (the <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?bad144" name="bad144">
      command) handling is still not 100&percnt; (to put it charitably) and
      it must unfortunately be said that if you've got an IDE or ESDI drive
      with lots of bad blocks, then FreeBSD is probably not for you!
      That said, it does work on thousands of IDE based systems, so
      you'd do well to try it first before simply giving up.

      <p>If you have a SCSI drive with bad blocks, see <ref id="awre"
      name="this answer">.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Strange things happen when I boot the install floppy!</heading>

      <p>If you're seeing things like the machine grinding to a halt or
      spontaneously rebooting when you try to boot the install floppy,
      here are three questions to ask yourself:-

      <enum>
        <item>Did you use a new, freshly-formatted, error-free floppy
        (preferably a brand-new one straight out of the box, as
        opposed to the magazine coverdisk that's been lying under
        the bed for the last three years)?

        <item>Did you download the floppy image in binary (or image) mode?
        (don't be embarrassed, even the best of us have accidentally
        downloaded a binary file in ASCII mode at least once!)

        <item>If you're using one of these new-fangled operating systems
        like Windows95 or Windows NT, did you shut it down and restart
       	the system in plain, honest DOS?  It seems these OS's can
        interfere with programs that write directly to hardware, which
        the disk creation program does; even running it inside a DOS
        shell in the GUI can cause this problem.
      </enum>

      <p>There have also been reports of Netscape causing problems when
      downloading the boot floppy, so it's probably best to use a different
      FTP client if you can.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Help! I can't install from tape!</heading>

      <p>If you are installing 2.1.7R from tape, you  must create the tape
      using a tar blocksize of 10 (5120 bytes).  The default tar
      blocksize is 20 (10240 bytes), and tapes created using this
      default size cannot be used to install 2.1.7R; with these tapes,
      you will get an error that complains about  the record size being
      too big.

      <heading>Connect two FreeBSD boxes over a parallel line (PLIP)
	</heading>

      <p>Get a laplink cable. Make sure both computer have a kernel
      with lpt driver support.

      <verb>
      $ dmesg | grep lp
      lpt0 at 0x378-0x37f irq 7 on isa

      <p>Plug in the laplink cable into the parallel interface.

      <p>Configure the network interface parameters for lp0 on both
      sites as root. For example, if you want connect the host max
      with moritz

      <verb>
                 max <-----> moritz

        Which geometry should I use for a disk drive?<label id="geometry">
      </heading>

      <p>(By the "geometry" of a disk, we mean the number of cylinders,
      heads and sectors/track on a disk - I'll refer to this as
      C/H/S for convenience.  This is how the PC's BIOS works out
      which area on a disk to read/write from).

      <p>This seems to cause a lot of confusion for some reason.  First
      of all, the <tt /physical/ geometry of a SCSI drive is totally
      irrelevant, as FreeBSD works in term of disk blocks.  In fact, there
      is no such thing as "the" physical geometry, as the sector density
      varies across the disk - what manufacturers claim is the "true"
      physical geometry is usually the geometry that they've worked out
      results in the least wasted space.  For IDE disks, FreeBSD does
      work in terms of C/H/S, but all modern drives will convert this
      into block references internally as well.

      <p>All that matters is the <tt /logical/ geometry - the answer that the
      BIOS gets when it asks "what is your geometry?" and then uses to access
      the disk.  As FreeBSD uses the BIOS when booting, it's very important
      to get this right.  In particular, if you have more than one operating
      system on a disk, they must all agree on the geometry, otherwise you
      will have serious problems booting!

      <p>For SCSI disks, the geometry to use depends on whether extended
      translation support is turned on in your controller (this is
      often referred to as "support for DOS disks &gt;1GB" or something
      similar).  If it's turned off, then use N cylinders, 64 heads
      and 32 sectors/track, where 'N' is the capacity of the disk in
      MB.  For example, a 2GB disk should pretend to have 2048 cylinders,
      64 heads and 32 sectors/track.

      <p>If it <tt /is/ turned on (it's often supplied this way to get around
      certain limitations in MSDOS) and the disk capacity is more than 1GB,
      use M cylinders, 63 sectors per track (*not* 64), and 255 heads, where
      'M' is the disk capacity in MB divided by 7.844238 (!).  So our
      example 2GB drive would have 261 cylinders, 63 sectors per track and
      255 heads.

      <p>If you are not sure about this, or FreeBSD fails to detect the
      geometry correctly during installation, the simplest way around
      this is usually to create a small DOS partition on the disk.  The
      correct geometry should then be detected (and you can always remove
      the DOS partition in the partition editor if you don't want to keep
      it, or leave it around for programming network cards and the like).

      <p>Alternatively, there is a freely available utility distributed with
      FreeBSD called ``<tt/pfdisk.exe/'' (located in the <tt>tools</tt>
      subdirectory on the FreeBSD CDROM or on the various FreeBSD
      ftp sites) which can be used to work out what geometry the other
      operating systems on the disk are using.  You can then enter this
      geometry in the partition editor.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Any restrictions on how I divide the disk up?</heading>

      <p>Yes. You must make sure that your root partition is below 1024
      cylinders so the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.  (Note that this
      is a limitation in the PC's BIOS, not FreeBSD).

      <p>For a SCSI drive, this will normally imply that the root partition
      will be in the first 1024MB (or in the first 4096MB if extended
      translation is turned on - see previous question).  For IDE, the
      corresponding figure is 504MB.

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        What about disk managers? Or, I have a large drive!
      </heading>

      <p>FreeBSD recognizes the Ontrack Disk Manager and makes allowances
      for it. Other disk managers are not supported.

      <p>If you just want to use the disk with FreeBSD you don't need a
      disk manager. Just configure the disk for as much space as the
      BIOS can deal with (usually 504 megabytes), and FreeBSD
      should figure out how much space you really have. If you're using
      an old disk with an MFM controller, you may need to explicitly
      tell FreeBSD how many cylinders to use.

      <p>If you want to use the disk with FreeBSD and another operating
      system, you may be able to do without a disk manager: just make sure
      the the FreeBSD boot partition and the slice for the other
      operating system are in the first 1024 cylinders. If you're
      reasonably careful, a 20 megabyte boot partition should be plenty.

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        When I boot FreeBSD I get ``Missing Operating System''
        <label id="missing_os">
      </heading>

      <p>This is classically a case of FreeBSD and DOS or some other OS
      conflicting over their ideas of disk <ref id="geometry"
      name="geometry.">  You will have to reinstall FreeBSD, but obeying the
      instructions given above will almost always get you going.

    <sect1>
      <heading>I can't get past the boot manager's `F?' prompt.</heading>

      <p>This is another symptom of the problem described in the preceding
      question.  Your BIOS geometry and FreeBSD geometry settings do
      not agree!  If your controller or BIOS supports cylinder
      translation (often marked as ``&gt;1GB drive support''), try
      toggling its setting and reinstalling FreeBSD.

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        I have &gt;16MB of RAM. Will this cause any problems?<label id="bigram">
      </heading>

      <p>Apart from performance issues, no.  FreeBSD 2.X comes with bounce
      buffers which allow your bus mastering controller access to greater
      than 16MB. (Note that this should only be required if you are using
      ISA devices, although one or two broken EISA and VLB devices may
      need it as well).

      <p>Also look at the section on <ref id="reallybigram"
      name="&gt;64M machines"> if you have that much memory,
      or if you're using a Compaq or other BIOS that lies about
      the available memory.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Do I need to install the complete sources?</heading>

      <p>In general, no.  However, we would strongly recommend that you
      install, at a minimum, the ``<tt/base/'' source kit, which
      includes several of the files mentioned here, and the
      ``<tt/sys/'' (kernel) source kit, which includes sources for the
      kernel.  There is nothing in the system which requires the
      presence of the sources to operate, however, except for the
      kernel-configuration program 
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?config"
      name="config">.  With the exception
      of the kernel sources, our build structure is set up so that you
      can read-only mount the sources from elsewhere via NFS and still
      be able to make new binaries.  (Because of the kernel-source
      restriction, we recommend that you not mount this on
      <tt>/usr/src</tt> directly, but rather in some other location
      with appropriate symbolic links to duplicate the top-level
      structure of the source tree.)

      <p>Having the sources on-line and knowing how to build a system with
      them will make it much easier for you to upgrade to future
      releases of FreeBSD.

      <p>To actually select a subset of the sources, use the Custom
      menu item when you are in the Distributions menu of the
      system installation tool.  The <tt>src/install.sh</tt> script
      will also install partial pieces of the source distribution,
      depending on the arguments you pass it.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Do I need to build a kernel?</heading>

      <p>Building a new kernel was originally pretty much a required
      step in a FreeBSD installation, but more recent releases have
      benefited from the introduction of a much friendlier kernel
      configuration tool. When at the FreeBSD boot prompt (boot:),
      use the "-c" flag and you will be dropped into a visual
      configuration screen which allows you to configure the kernel's
      settings for most common ISA cards.

      <p>It's still recommended that you eventually build a new
      kernel containing just the drivers that you need, just to save a
      bit of RAM, but it's no longer a strict requirement for most
      systems.

      <heading>I live outside the US. Can I use DES encryption?</heading>

      <p>If it is not absolutely imperative that you use DES style
      encryption, you can use FreeBSD's default encryption for even
      <bf/better/ security, and with no export restrictions.  FreeBSD
      2.0's password default scrambler is now <bf/MD5/-based, and is
      more CPU-intensive to crack with an automated password cracker
      than DES, and allows longer passwords as well. The only reason
      for not using the <bf/MD5/-based crypt today would be to use the
      the same password entries on FreeBSD and non-FreeBSD systems.

      <p>Since the DES encryption algorithm cannot legally be exported
      from the US, non-US users should not download this software (as
      part of the <tt/secrdist/ from US FTP sites.

      <p>There is however a replacement libcrypt available, based on
      sources written in Australia by David Burren.  This code is now
      available on some non-US FreeBSD mirror sites.  Sources for the
      unencumbered libcrypt, and binaries of the programs which use it,
      can be obtained from the following FTP sites:

      <descrip>
        <tag/South Africa/
          <tt>ftp://ftp.internat.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD</tt><newline>
          <tt>ftp://storm.sea.uct.ac.za/pub/FreeBSD</tt>

        <tag/Brazil/
          <tt>ftp://ftp.iqm.unicamp.br/pub/FreeBSD</tt>

        <tag/Finland/
          <tt>ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/unix/FreeBSD/eurocrypt</tt>
      </descrip>

      <p>The non-US <tt/securedist/ can be used as a direct replacement
      for the encumbered US <tt/securedist/.  This <tt/securedist/
      package is installed the same way as the US package (see
      installation notes for details).  If you are going to install DES
      encryption, you should do so as soon as possible, before
      installing other software.

      <p>Non-US users should please not download any encryption software
      from the USA.  This can get the maintainers of the sites from
      which the software is downloaded into severe legal difficulties.

      <p>A non-US distribution of Kerberos is also being developed, and
      current versions can generally be obtained by anonymous FTP from
      <tt>braae.ru.ac.za</tt>.

      <p>There is also a <ref id="mailing" name="mailing list"> for the
      discussion of non-US encryption software.  For more information, send
      an email message with a single line saying ``<tt/help/'' in the body

    <heading>The boot floppy starts but hangs at the ``Probing Devices...''
     screen.</heading>

    <p>If you have a IDE Zip or Jaz drive installed, remove it and try again.
    The boot floppy can get confused by the drives.
    After the system is installed you can reconnect the drive.  Hopefully
    this will be fixed in a later release.

   <sect1>
    <heading>I get a ``panic: cant mount root'' error when rebooting the system after installation.</heading>

    <p>This error comes from confusion between the boot block's and the 
    kernel's understanding of the disk devices.  The error usually 
    manifests on two-disk IDE systems, with the hard disks arranged as the
    master or single device on separate IDE controllers, with FreeBSD
    installed on the secondary IDE controller.  The boot blocks think
    the system is installed on wd1 (the second BIOS disk) while the kernel
    assigns the first disk on the secondary controller device wd2.  After
    the device probing, the kernel tries to mount what the boot blocks 
    think is the boot disk, wd1, while it is really wd2, and fails.

    <p>To fix the problem, do one of the following:

    <enum>
     <item>At the Boot: prompt, enter
     <tt>1:wd(2,a)kernel</tt> and press Enter. If the system starts, then
     run the command 
<verb>
echo "1:wd(2,a)kernel" > /boot.config
</verb>
     to make it the default boot string.
     <item>Move the FreeBSD disk onto the primary IDE controller, so the 
     hard disks are consecutive.
     <item><url url="../handbook/kernelconfig.html" name="Rebuild your kernel,">
     modify the wd configuration lines to read:

<verb>
controller      wdc0    at isa? port "IO_WD1" bio irq 14 vector wdintr
disk            wd0     at wdc0 drive 0
# disk            wd1     at wdc0 drive 1 # comment out this line

controller      wdc1    at isa? port "IO_WD2" bio irq 15 vector wdintr
disk            wd1     at wdc1 drive 0 # change from wd2 to wd1
disk            wd2     at wdc1 drive 1 # change from wd3 to wd2
</verb>

     Install the new kernel.
     If you moved your disks and wish to restore the previous 
     configuration, replace the disks in the desired configuration and reboot.
     Your system should boot successfully.

     <heading>What are the limits for memory?</heading>
     
     <p>For memory, the (theoretical) limit is 4 gigabytes.  One gigabyte
     has been tested; you generally can't buy i386 PCs that can support
     much more than that.

     <sect1>
     <heading>What are the limits for ffs filesystems?</heading>
     
     <p>For ffs filesystems, the maximum theoretical limit is 8 terabytes
     (2G blocks), or 16TB for the default block size of 8K.
     In practice, there is a soft limit of 1 terabyte, but with modifications
     filesystems with 4 terabytes are possible (and exist).

     <p>The maximum size of a single ffs file is approximately 1G blocks 
     (4TB) if the block size is 4K.

     <verb>
                           maxfilesize

fs block size   -stable  -current  works  should-work
-------------   -------  --------  -----  -----------

8K              32+G       8T-1    32+G   16T-1
16K             128+G      16T-1   128+G  32T-1

64K             2048+G     64T-1   2048+G 128T-1
     </verb>

     <p>When the fs block size is 4K, triple indirect blocks work and
     everything should be limited by the maximum fs block number that can
     be represented using triple indirect blocks (approx. 1K^3 + 1K^2 +
     1K), but everything is limited by a (wrong) limit of 1G-1 on fs block
     numbers.  The limit on fs block numbers should be 2G-1.  There are
     some bugs for fs block numbers near 2G-1, but such block numbers are
     unreachable when the fs block size is 4K.

     <p>For block sizes of 8K and larger, everything should be limited
     by the 2G-1 limit on fs block numbers, but is actually limited by the
     1G-1 limit on fs block numbers, except under -stable triple indirect
     blocks are unreachable, so the limit is the maxiumum fs block number
     that can be represented using double indirect blocks
     (approx. (blocksize/4)^2 + (blocksize/4)), and under -current
     exceeding this limit may cause problems.  Using the correct limit of
     2G-1 blocks does cause problems.

     <sect1>
     <heading>How can I put 1TB files on my floppy?</heading>

     <p>I keep several virtual ones on floppies :-).  The maxiumum
     file size is not closely related to the maximum disk size.  The
     maximum disk size is 1TB.  It is a feature that the file size can be
     larger than the disk size.

     <p>The following example creates a file of size 8T-1 using a
     whole 32K of disk space (3 indirect blocks and 1 data block) on a
     small root partition.  The dd command requires a dd that works with
     large files.

    <heading>I compiled a new kernel and now I get the error message "archsw.readin.failed" when booting.</heading>
 
    <p>You can boot by specifying the kernel directly at the second
    stage, pressing any key when the | shows up before loader is
    started. More specifically, you have upgraded the source for your
    kernel, and installed a new kernel builtin from them <em>without making
    world</em>. This is not supported. Make world.

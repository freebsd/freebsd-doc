    <heading>Serial Communications<label id="serial"></heading>

    <p>This section answers common questions about serial communications
    with FreeBSD.  PPP and SLIP are covered in the <ref id="networking"
    name="Networking"> section.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How do I tell if FreeBSD found my serial ports?</heading>

      <p>As the FreeBSD kernel boots, it will probe for the serial ports
      in your system for which the kernel was configured.  You can
      either watch your system closely for the messages it prints or
      run the command

      <verb>
        dmesg | grep sio
      </verb>

      <p>after your system's up and running.

      <p>Here's some example output from the above command:

      <verb>
        sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
        sio0: type 16550A
        sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
        sio1: type 16550A
      </verb>

      <p>This shows two serial ports.  The first is on irq 4, is using
      port address <tt/0x3f8/, and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The
      second uses the same kind of chip but is on irq 3 and is at port
      address <tt/0x2f8/.  Internal modem cards are treated just like
      serial ports---except that they always have a modem ``attached''
      to the port.

      <p>The <tt/GENERIC/ kernel includes support for two serial ports
      using the same irq and port address settings in the above
      example.  If these settings aren't right for your system, or if
      you've added modem cards or have more serial ports than your
      kernel is configured for, just reconfigure your kernel.  See
      section <ref id="make-kernel" name="about building a kernel"> for
      more details.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How do I tell if FreeBSD found my modem cards?</heading>

      <p>Refer to the answer to the previous question.

    <sect1>
      <heading>I just upgraded to 2.0.5 and my <tt/tty0X/ are missing!</heading>

      <p>Don't worry, they have been merged with the <tt/ttydX/ devices.
      You'll have to change any old configuration files you have, though.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How do I access the serial ports on FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>The third serial port, <htmlurl
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio" name="sio2"> (known as
      COM3 in DOS), is on <tt>/dev/cuaa2</tt> for dial-out devices, and on
      <tt>/dev/ttyd2</tt> for dial-in devices.  What's the difference
      between these two classes of devices?

      <p>You use <tt/ttydX/ for dial-ins.  When opening <tt>/dev/ttydX</tt>
      in blocking mode, a process will wait for the corresponding
      <tt/cuaaX/ device to become inactive, and then wait
      for the carrier detect line to go active.  When you open the
      <tt/cuaaX/ device, it makes sure the serial port isn't already in
      use by the <tt/ttydX/ device.  If the port's available, it
      ``steals'' it from the <tt/ttydX/ device.  Also, the <tt/cuaXX/
      device doesn't care about carrier detect.  With this scheme and
      an auto-answer modem, you can have remote users log in and you
      can still dialout with the same modem and the system will take
      care of all the conflicts.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How do I enable support for a multiport serial card?</heading>

      <p>Again, the section on kernel configuration provides information
      about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport serial card,
      place an <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio"
      name="sio"> line for each serial port on the card in the
      kernel configuration file.  But place the irq and vector
      specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports on the
      card should share one irq.  For consistency, use the last serial
      port to specify the irq.  Also, specify the <tt/COM&lowbar;MULTIPORT/
      option.

      <p>The following example is for an AST 4-port serial card on irq 7:

      <verb>
        options "COM_MULTIPORT"
        device sio4 at isa? port 0x2a0 tty flags 0x781
        device sio5 at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x781
        device sio6 at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x781
        device sio7 at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x781 irq 7 vector siointr
      </verb>

      <p>The flags indicate that the master port has minor number 7
      (<tt/0x700/), diagnostics enabled during probe (<tt/0x080/), and
      all the ports share an irq (<tt/0x001/).

    <sect1>
      <heading>Can FreeBSD handle multiport serial cards sharing irqs?</heading>

      <p>Not yet. You'll have to use a different irq for each card.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Can I set the default serial parameters for a port?</heading>

      <p>The <tt/ttydX/ (or <tt/cuaaX/) device is the regular device
      you'll want to open for your applications.  When a process opens
      the device, it'll have a default set of terminal I/O settings.
      You can see these settings with the command

      <verb>
        stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1
      </verb>

      <p>When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in
      effect until the device is closed.  When it's reopened, it goes
      back to the default set.  To make changes to the default set, you
      can open and adjust the settings of the ``initial state'' device.
      For example, to turn on <tt/CLOCAL/ mode, 8 bits, and
      <tt>XON/XOFF</tt> flow control by default for ttyd5, do:

      <verb>
        stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff
      </verb>

      <p>A good place to do this is in <tt>/etc/rc.serial</tt>. Now, an
      application will have these settings by default when it opens
      <tt/ttyd5/.  It can still change these settings to its liking,
      though.

      <p>You can also prevent certain settings from being changed by an
      application by making adjustments to the ``lock state'' device.
      For example, to lock the speed of <tt/ttyd5/ to 57600 bps, do

      <verb>
        stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600
      </verb>

      <p>Now, an application that opens <tt/ttyd5/ and tries to change the
      speed of the port will be stuck with 57600 bps.

      <p>Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state
      devices writable only by <tt/root/. The <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?MAKEDEV"
      name="MAKEDEV"> script does <bf/NOT/ do this when it creates the
      device entries.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How can I enable dialup logins on my modem?</heading>

      <p>So you want to become an Internet service provider, eh?  First,
      you'll need one or more modems that can auto-answer.  Your modem
      will need to assert carrier-detect when it detects a carrier and
      not assert it all the time.  It will need to hang up the phone
      and reset itself when the data terminal ready (<tt/DTR/) line
      goes from on to off.  It should probably use <tt>RTS/CTS</tt>
      flow control or no local flow control at all.  Finally, it must
      use a constant speed between the computer and itself, but (to be
      nice to your callers) it should negotiate a speed between itself
      and the remote modem.

      <p>For many Hayes command-set--compatible modems, this command will
      make these settings and store them in nonvolatile memory:

      <verb>
        AT &amp;C1 &amp;D3 &amp;K3 &amp;Q6 S0=1 &amp;W
      </verb>

      <p>See the section <ref id="direct-at" name="on sending AT
      commands"> below for information on how to make these settings
      without resorting to an MS-DOS terminal program.

      <p>Next, make an entry in <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys" name="/etc/ttys"> for the
      modem.  This file lists all the ports on which the operating system will
      await logins.  Add a line that looks something like this:

      <verb>
        ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.57600" dialup on insecure
      </verb>

      <p>This line indicates that the second serial port
      (<tt>/dev/ttyd1</tt>) has a modem connected running at 57600 bps
      and no parity (<tt/std.57600/, which comes from the file
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?gettytab"
      name="/etc/gettytab">). The terminal type for this port is
      ``dialup.''  The port is ``on'' and is ``insecure''---meaning
      root logins on the port aren't allowed.  For dialin ports like
      this one, use the <tt/ttydX/ entry.

      <p>It's common practice to use ``dialup'' as the terminal type.
      Many users set up in their .profile or .login files a prompt for
      the actual terminal type if the starting type is dialup.  The
      example shows the port as insecure.  To become root on this port,
      you have to login as a regular user, then ``<htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?su" name="su">'' to
      <tt/root/.  If you use ``secure'' then <tt/root/ can login in
      directly.

      <p>After making modifications to <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys" name="/etc/ttys">, you
      need to send a hangup or <tt/HUP/ signal to the <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?init" name="init"> process:

      <verb>
        kill -HUP 1
      </verb>

      <p>This forces the init process to reread <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys" name="/etc/ttys">.  The
      init process will then start getty processes on all ``on'' ports.
      You can find out if logins are available for your port by typing

      <verb>
        ps -ax | grep '[t]tyd1'
      </verb>

      <p>You should see something like:

      <verb>
        747 ??  I      0:00.04 /usr/libexec/getty std.57600 ttyd1
      </verb>

    <sect1>
      <heading>How can I connect a dumb terminal to my FreeBSD box?</heading>

      <p>If you're using another computer as a terminal into your FreeBSD
      system, get a null modem cable to go between the two serial
      ports.  If you're using an actual terminal, see its accompanying
      instructions.

      <p>Then, modify <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys"
      name="/etc/ttys">, like above.  For example, if you're hooking up a
      WYSE-50 terminal to the fifth serial port, use an entry like this:

      <verb>
        ttyd4 "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400" wyse50 on secure
      </verb>

      <p>This example shows that the port on <tt>/dev/ttyd4</tt> has a
      wyse50 terminal connected at 38400 bps with no parity
      (<tt/std.38400/ from <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?gettytab"
      name="/etc/gettytab">) and <tt/root/ logins are allowed (secure).

    <sect1>
      <heading>Why can't I run <tt/tip/ or <tt/cu/?</heading>

      <p>On your system, the programs <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip"> and <htmlurl
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?cu" name="cu"> are probably
      executable only by <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?uucp"
      name="uucp"> and group <tt/dialer/.  You can use the group <tt/dialer/
      to control who has access to your modem or remote systems.  Just add
      yourself to group dialer.

      <p>Alternatively, you can let everyone on your system run <tt/tip/
      and <tt/cu/ by typing:

      <verb>
        # chmod 4511 /usr/bin/cu
        # chmod 4511 /usr/bin/tip
      </verb>

    <sect1>
      <heading>My stock Hayes modem isn't supported---what can I do?</heading>

      <p>Actually, the man page for <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip"> is out of
      date.  There is a generic Hayes dialer already built in.  Just use
      ``<tt/at=hayes/'' in your <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?remote" name="/etc/remote"> file.

      <p>The Hayes driver isn't smart enough to recognize some of the
      advanced features of newer modems---messages like <tt/BUSY/,
      <tt/NO DIALTONE/, or <tt/CONNECT 115200/ will just confuse it.
      You should turn those messages off when you use <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip"> (using
      <tt/ATX0&amp;W/).

      <p>Also, the dial timeout for <tt/tip/ is 60 seconds.  Your modem
      should use something less, or else tip will think there's a
      communication problem.  Try <tt/ATS7=45&amp;W/.

      <p>Actually, as shipped <tt/tip/ doesn't yet support it fully. The
      solution is to edit the file <tt/tipconf.h/ in the directory
      <tt>/usr/src/usr.bin/tip/tip</tt>.  Obviously you need the source
      distribution to do this.

      <p>Edit the line ``<tt/#define HAYES 0/'' to ``<tt/#define HAYES
      1/''. Then ``<tt/make/'' and ``<tt/make install/''. Everything
      works nicely after that.

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        How am I expected to enter these AT commands?<label id="direct-at">
      </heading>

      <p>Make what's called a ``<tt/direct/'' entry in your
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?remote"
      name="/etc/remote"> file.  For example, if your modem's hooked
      up to the first serial port, <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt>, then put in the
      following line:

      <verb>
        cuaa0:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#19200:pa=none
      </verb>

      <p>Use the highest bps rate your modem supports in the br
      capability.  Then, type <htmlurl
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip cuaa0"> and
      you'll be connected to your modem.

      <p>If there is no <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt> on your system, do this:

      <verb>
        # cd /dev
        # ./MAKEDEV cuaa0
      </verb>

      <p>Or use cu as root with the following command:

      <verb>
        # cu -l``line'' -s``speed''
      </verb>

      <p>with line being the serial port (e.g.<tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt>)
      and speed being the speed (e.g.<tt>57600</tt>).  When you are done
      entering the AT commands hit <tt>~.</tt> to exit.

    <sect1>
      <heading>The <tt/@/ sign for the pn capability doesn't work!</heading>

      <p>The <tt/@/ sign in the phone number capability tells tip to look in
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?phones(5)"
      name="/etc/phones"> for a phone number.  But the <tt/@/ sign is
      also a special character in capability files like
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?remote"
      name="/etc/remote">.  Escape it with a backslash:

      <verb>
        pn=\@
      </verb>

    <sect1>
      <heading>How can I dial a phone number on the command line?</heading>

      <p>Put what's called a ``<tt/generic/'' entry in your
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?remote"
      name="/etc/remote"> file.  For example:

      <verb>
        tip115200|Dial any phone number at 115200 bps:\
        :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#115200:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
        tip57600|Dial any phone number at 57600 bps:\
        :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
      </verb>

      <p>Then you can do something like ``<tt/tip -115200 5551234/''.  If you
      prefer <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?cu"
      name="cu"> over <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip">, use a
      generic cu entry:

      <verb>
        cu115200|Use cu to dial any number at 115200bps:\
        :dv=/dev/cuaa1:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
      </verb>

      <p>and type ``<tt/cu 5551234 -s 115200/''.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Do I have to type in the bps rate every time I do that?</heading>

      <p>Put in an entry for <tt/tip1200/ or <tt/cu1200/, but go ahead and
      use whatever bps rate is appropriate with the br capability. <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip"> thinks a good
      default is 1200 bps which is why it looks for a ``<tt/tip1200/'' entry.
      You don't have to use 1200 bps, though.

    <sect1>
      <heading>I access a number of hosts through a terminal server.</heading>

      <p>Rather than waiting until you're connected and typing
      ``<tt/CONNECT &lt;host&gt;/'' each time, use tip's <tt/cm/
      capability. For example, these entries in
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?remote"
       name="/etc/remote">:

      <verb>
        pain|pain.deep13.com|Forrester's machine:\
        :cm=CONNECT pain\n:tc=deep13:
        muffin|muffin.deep13.com|Frank's machine:\
        :cm=CONNECT muffin\n:tc=deep13:
        deep13:Gizmonics Institute terminal server:\
        :dv=/dev/cua02:br#38400:at=hayes:du:pa=none:pn=5551234:
      </verb>

      <p>will let you type ``<tt/tip pain/'' or ``<tt/tip muffin/'' to
      connect to the hosts pain or muffin; and ``<tt/tip deep13/'' to
      get to the terminal server.

      you want to keep retrying, run <tt/tip/ in a while loop.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Why do I have to hit CTRL+P twice to send CTRL+P once?</heading>

      <p>CTRL+P is the default ``force'' character, used to tell 
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip">
      that the next character is literal data.  You can set the force
      character to any other character with the <tt/~s/ escape, which
      means ``set a variable.''

      <p>Type ``<tt/~sforce=&lt;single-char&gt;/'' followed by a newline.
      <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is any single character.  If you leave
      out <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/, then the force character is the nul
      character, which you can get by typing CTRL+2 or CTRL+SPACE.  A
      pretty good value for <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is SHIFT+CTRL+6,
      which I've seen only used on some terminal servers.

      <p>You can have the force character be whatever you want by
      specifying the following in your <tt>&dollar;HOME/.tiprc</tt>
      file:

      <verb>
        force=<single-char>
      </verb>

    <sect1>
      <heading>Suddenly everything I type is in UPPER CASE??</heading>

      <p>You must've pressed CTRL+A, <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip" name="tip"> ``raise
      character,'' specially designed for people with broken caps-lock keys.
      Use <tt/~s/ as above and set the variable ``raisechar'' to something
      reasonable.  In fact, you can set it to the same as the force
      character, if you never expect to use either of these features.

      <p>Here's a sample .tiprc file perfect for Emacs users who need to
      type CTRL+2 and CTRL+A a lot:

      <verb>
        force=^^
        raisechar=^^
      </verb>

      <p>The ^^ is SHIFT+CTRL+6.

      <p>If you're talking to another UNIX system, you can send and
      receive files with <tt/~p/ (put) and <tt/~t/ (take).  These
      commands run <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?cat"
      name="cat"> and <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?echo"
      name="echo"> on the remote system to accept and send files.  The syntax
      is:

      <verb>
        ~p <local-file> [<remote-file>]
        ~t <remote-file> [<local-file>]
      </verb>

      <p>There's no error checking, so you probably should use another
      protocol, like zmodem.

      <heading>How can I run zmodem with <tt/tip/?</heading>

      <p>First, install one of the zmodem programs from the ports
      collection (such as one of the two from the comms category,
      <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi?^lrzsz" name="lrzsz">
      and <htmlurl url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi?^rzsz"
      name="rzsz">).

      <p>To receive files, start the sending program on the remote end.
      Then, press enter and type ``<tt/~C rz/'' (or ``<tt/~C lrz/'' if
      you installed lrzsz) to begin receiving them locally.

      <p>To send files, start the receiving program on the remote end.
      Then, press enter and type ``<tt/~C sz &lt;files&gt;/'' (or
      ``<tt/~C lsz &lt;files&gt;/'') to send them to the
      remote system.

     <heading>FreeBSD can't seem to find my serial ports, even when the
     settings are correct.</heading>
   
     <p>Motherboards and cards with Acer UARTs do not probe properly under
     the FreeBSD sio probe.  Obtain a patch from

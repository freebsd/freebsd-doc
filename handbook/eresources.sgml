  <heading>Resources on the Internet<label id="eresources"></heading>

  <p><em>Contributed by &a.jkh;.</em>

  <p>The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a
    means of following the latest developments.  Electronic resources are
    the best, if not often the only, way stay informed of the latest advances.
    Since FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also
    generally serves as a `technical support department' of sorts, with
    electronic mail and  USENET news being the most effective way of reaching
    that community.

    The most important points of contact with the FreeBSD
    user community are outlined below.  If you are aware of other
    resources not mentioned here, please send them to the &a.doc
    so that they may also be included.

      <sect>
        <heading>Mailing lists<label id="eresources:mail"></heading>

<p>Though many of the FreeBSD development members read USENET, we cannot
always guarantee that we will get to your questions in a timely fashion
(or at all) if you post them only to one of the comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.*
groups.  By addressing your questions to the appropriate mailing list
you will reach both us and a concentrated FreeBSD audience, invariably
assuring a better (or at least faster) response.

<p>The charters for the various lists are given at the bottom of this
document.  <bf>Please read the charter before joining or sending
mail to any list</bf>.  Most of our list subscribers now receive many hundreds
of FreeBSD related messages every day, and by setting down charters
and rules for proper use we are striving to keep the signal-to-noise ratio
of the lists high.  To do less would see the mailing lists ultimately fail
as an effective communications medium for the project.

Archives are kept for all of the mailing lists and can be searched
using the <url url="../search/search.html"
name="FreeBSD World Wide Web server">.  The keyword searchable archive
offers an excellent way of finding answers to frequently asked
questions and should be consulted before posting a question.

<sect1><heading>List summary<label id="eresources:summary"></heading>

<sect1><heading>How to subscribe<label id="eresources:subscribe"></heading>

<p>All mailing lists live on <tt>FreeBSD.ORG</tt>, so to post to a
given list you simply mail to <em>listname</em><tt>@FreeBSD.ORG</tt>.  It
will then be redistributed to mailing list members world-wide.

To subscribe to a list, send mail to &a.majordomo and include
<tscreen><verb>
subscribe <listname> [<optional address>]
</verb></tscreen>
In the body of your message.  For example, to subscribe yourself to
freebsd-announce, you'd do:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
subscribe freebsd-announce
^D
</verb></tscreen>
If you want to subscribe yourself under a different name, or submit a
subscription request for a local mailing list (note: this is more efficient
if you have several interested parties at one site, and highly appreciated by
us!), you would do something like:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
subscribe freebsd-announce local-announce@somesite.com
^D
</verb></tscreen>
Finally, it is also possible to unsubscribe yourself from a list, get a
list of other list members or see the list of mailing lists again by
sending other types of control messages to majordomo.  For a complete
list of available commands, do this:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
help
^D
</verb></tscreen>
Again, we would like to request that you keep discussion in the technical mailing
lists on a technical track.  If you are only interested in the "high points"
then it is suggested that you join freebsd-announce, which is intended only
for infrequent traffic.

<sect1><heading>List charters<label id="eresources:charters"></heading>

<p><bf>All</bf>FreeBSD mailing lists have certain basic rules
which must be adhered to by anyone using them.  Failure to comply
with these guidelines will result in two (2) written warnings from the
FreeBSD <url url="mailto:postmaster@freebsd.org" name="Postmaster">,
after which, on a third offense, the poster will removed from all
FreeBSD mailing lists and filtered from further posting to them.
We regret that such rules and measures are necessary at all, but
today's Internet is a pretty harsh environment, it would seem, and
many fail to appreciate just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.

<p>Rules of the road:
<itemize>
<item>The topic of any posting should adhere to the basic charter of the list
      it is posted to, e.g. if the list is about technical issues then your
      posting should contain technical discussion.  Ongoing irrelevant chatter
      or flaming only detracts from the value of the mailing list for everyone
      on it and will not be tolerated.  For free-form discussion on no
      particular topic, the <url url="mailto:freebsd-chat@freebsd.org"
      name="freebsd-chat"> mailing list is freely available and should
      be used instead.</item>

<item>No posting should be made to more than 2 mailing lists, and only
      to 2 when a clear and obvious need to post to both lists exists.
      For most lists, there is already a great deal of subscriber overlap
      and except for the most esoteric mixes (say "-stable & -scsi"), there
      really is no reason to post to more than one list at a time.
      If a message is sent to you in such a way that multiple mailing lists
      appear on the Cc line then the cc line should also be trimmed before
      sending it out again.
      <em>You are <bf>still</bf> responsible for your own cross-postings, no
      matter who the originator might have been.</em></item>

<item>Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument) are
      not allowed, and that includes users and developers alike.  Gross
      breaches of netiquette, like excerpting or reposting private mail
      when permission to do so was not and would not be forthcoming, 
      are frowned upon but not specifically enforced.  <bf>However</bf>,
      there are also very few cases where such content would fit within the
      charter of a list and it would therefore probably rate a warning
      (or ban) on that basis alone.</item>

<item>Advertising of non-FreeBSD related products or services is
      strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban if it
      is clear that the offender is advertising by spam.</item>

</itemize>

running at the same time

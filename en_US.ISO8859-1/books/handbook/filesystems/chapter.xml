    <para>File systems are an integral part of any operating system.
      They allow users to upload and store files, provide access
      to data, and make hard drives useful.  Different operating
      systems differ in their native file system.  Traditionally, the
      native &os; file system has been the Unix File System
      <acronym>UFS</acronym> which has been modernized as
      <acronym>UFS2</acronym>.  Since &os;&nbsp;7.0, the Z File
      System <acronym>ZFS</acronym> is also available as a native file
      system.</para>

    <para>In addition to its native file systems, &os; supports a
      multitude of other file systems so that data from other
      operating systems can be accessed locally, such as data stored
      on locally attached <acronym>USB</acronym> storage devices,
      flash drives, and hard disks.  This includes support for the
      &linux; Extended File System (<acronym>EXT</acronym>) and the
      &microsoft; New Technology File System
      (<acronym>NTFS</acronym>).</para>

    <para>There are different levels of &os; support for the various
      file systems.  Some require a kernel module to be loaded and
      others may require a toolset to be installed.  Some non-native
      file system support is full read-write while others are
      read-only.</para>

    <title>The Z File System (ZFS)</title>

    <para>The Z&nbsp;file system, originally developed by &sun;,
      is designed to use a pooled storage method in that space is only
      used as it is needed for data storage.  It is also designed for
      maximum data integrity, supporting data snapshots, multiple
      copies, and data checksums.  It uses a software data replication
      model, known as <acronym>RAID</acronym>-Z.
      <acronym>RAID</acronym>-Z provides redundancy similar to
      hardware <acronym>RAID</acronym>, but is designed to prevent
      data write corruption and to overcome some of the limitations
      of hardware <acronym>RAID</acronym>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>ZFS Tuning</title>

      <para>Some of the features provided by <acronym>ZFS</acronym>
	are RAM-intensive, so some tuning may be required to provide
	maximum efficiency on systems with limited RAM.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Memory</title>

	<para>At a bare minimum, the total system memory should be at
	  least one gigabyte.  The amount of recommended RAM depends
	  upon the size of the pool and the ZFS features which are
	  used.  A general rule of thumb is 1GB of RAM for every 1TB
	  of storage.  If the deduplication feature is used, a general
	  rule of thumb is 5GB of RAM per TB of storage to be
	  deduplicated.  While some users successfully use ZFS with
	  less RAM, it is possible that when the system is under heavy
	  load, it may panic due to memory exhaustion.  Further tuning
	  may be required for systems with less than the recommended
	  RAM requirements.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Kernel Configuration</title>

	<para>Due to the RAM limitations of the &i386; platform, users
	  using ZFS on the &i386; architecture should add the
	  following option to a custom kernel configuration file,
	  rebuild the kernel, and reboot:</para>

	<programlisting>options 	KVA_PAGES=512</programlisting>

	<para>This option expands the kernel address space, allowing
	  the <varname>vm.kvm_size</varname> tunable to be pushed
	  beyond the currently imposed limit of 1&nbsp;GB, or the
	  limit of 2&nbsp;GB for <acronym>PAE</acronym>.  To find the
	  most suitable value for this option, divide the desired
	  address space in megabytes by four (4).  In this example, it
	  is <literal>512</literal> for 2&nbsp;GB.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Loader Tunables</title>

	<para>The <devicename>kmem</devicename> address space can
	  be increased on all &os; architectures.  On a test system
	  with one gigabyte of physical memory, success was achieved
	  with the following options added to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, and the system
	  restarted:</para>

	<programlisting>vm.kmem_size="330M"
vm.kmem_size_max="330M"
vfs.zfs.arc_max="40M"
vfs.zfs.vdev.cache.size="5M"</programlisting>

	<para>For a more detailed list of recommendations for
	  ZFS-related tuning, see <ulink
	    url="http://wiki.freebsd.org/ZFSTuningGuide"></ulink>.</para>

      <title>Using <acronym>ZFS</acronym></title>

      <para>There is a start up mechanism that allows &os; to
	mount <acronym>ZFS</acronym> pools during system
	initialization.  To set it, issue the following
	commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'zfs_enable="YES"' &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>service zfs start</userinput></screen>

      <para>The examples in this section assume three
	<acronym>SCSI</acronym> disks with the device names
	<devicename><replaceable>da0</replaceable></devicename>,
	<devicename><replaceable>da1</replaceable></devicename>,
	and <devicename><replaceable>da2</replaceable></devicename>.
	Users of <acronym>IDE</acronym> hardware should instead use
	<devicename><replaceable>ad</replaceable></devicename>
	device names.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Single Disk Pool</title>

	<para>To create a simple, non-redundant <acronym>ZFS</acronym>
	  pool using a single disk device, use
	  <command>zpool</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zpool create example /dev/da0</userinput></screen>

	<para>To view the new pool, review the output of
	  <command>df</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>df</userinput>

	<para>This output shows that the <literal>example</literal>
	  pool has been created and <emphasis>mounted</emphasis>.  It
	  is now accessible as a file system.  Files may be created
	  on it and users can browse it, as seen in the following
	  example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /example</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ls</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>touch testfile</userinput>

	<para>However, this pool is not taking advantage of any
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> features.  To create a dataset on
	  this pool with compression enabled:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs create example/compressed</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set compression=gzip example/compressed</userinput></screen>

	<para>The <literal>example/compressed</literal> dataset is now
	  a <acronym>ZFS</acronym> compressed file system.  Try
	  copying some large files to <filename
	    class="directory">/example/compressed</filename>.</para>

	<para>Compression can be disabled with:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set compression=off example/compressed</userinput></screen>

	<para>To unmount a file system, issue the following command
	  and then verify by using <command>df</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs umount example/compressed</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>df</userinput>

	<para>The pool and file system may also be observed by viewing
	  the output from <command>mount</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount</userinput>
/dev/ad0s1a on / (ufs, local)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local)

example on /example (zfs, local)
example/data on /example/data (zfs, local)
example/compressed on /example/compressed (zfs, local)</screen>

	<para><acronym>ZFS</acronym> datasets, after creation, may be
	  used like any file systems.  However, many other features
	  are available which can be set on a per-dataset basis.  In
	  the following example, a new file system,
	  <literal>data</literal> is created.  Important files will be
	  stored here, the file system is set to keep two copies of
	  each data block:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs create example/data</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set copies=2 example/data</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is now possible to see the data and space utilization
	  by issuing <command>df</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>df</userinput>
Filesystem         1K-blocks    Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/ad0s1a          2026030  235234  1628714    13%    /
devfs                      1       1        0   100%    /dev
/dev/ad0s1d         54098308 1032864 48737580     2%    /usr

example/data        17547008       0 17547008     0%    /example/data</screen>

	<para>Notice that each file system on the pool has the same
	  amount of available space.  This is the reason for using
	  <command>df</command> in these examples, to show that the
	  file systems use only the amount of space they need and all
	  draw from the same pool.  The <acronym>ZFS</acronym> file
	  system does away with concepts such as volumes and
	  partitions, and allows for several file systems to occupy
	  the same pool.</para>

	<para>To destroy the file systems and then destroy the pool as
	  they are no longer needed:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs destroy example/compressed</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs destroy example/data</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zpool destroy example</userinput></screen>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title><acronym>ZFS</acronym> RAID-Z</title>

	<para>There is no way to prevent a disk from failing.  One
	  method of avoiding data loss due to a failed hard disk is to
	  implement <acronym>RAID</acronym>.  <acronym>ZFS</acronym>
	  supports this feature in its pool design.</para>

	<para>To create a <acronym>RAID</acronym>-Z pool, issue the
	  following command and specify the disks to add to the
	  pool:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zpool create storage raidz da0 da1 da2</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>&sun; recommends that the amount of devices used in
	    a <acronym>RAID</acronym>-Z configuration is between
	    three and nine.  For environments requiring a single pool
	    consisting of 10 disks or more, consider breaking it up
	    into smaller <acronym>RAID</acronym>-Z groups.  If only
	    two disks are available and redundancy is a requirement,
	    consider using a <acronym>ZFS</acronym> mirror.  Refer to
	    &man.zpool.8; for more details.</para>
	</note>

	<para>This command creates the <literal>storage</literal>
	  zpool.  This may be verified using &man.mount.8; and
	  &man.df.1;.  This command makes a new file system in the
	  pool called <literal>home</literal>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs create storage/home</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is now possible to enable compression and keep extra
	  copies of directories and files using the following
	  commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set copies=2 storage/home</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set compression=gzip storage/home</userinput></screen>

	<para>To make this the new home directory for users, copy the
	  user data to this directory, and create the appropriate
	  symbolic links:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp -rp /home/* /storage/home</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>rm -rf /home /usr/home</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /storage/home /home</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /storage/home /usr/home</userinput></screen>

	<para>Users should now have their data stored on the freshly
	  created <filename
	    class="directory">/storage/home</filename>.  Test by
	  adding a new user and logging in as that user.</para>

	<para>Try creating a snapshot which may be rolled back
	  later:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs snapshot storage/home@08-30-08</userinput></screen>

	<para>Note that the snapshot option will only capture a real
	  file system, not a home directory or a file.  The
	  <literal>@</literal> character is a delimiter used between
	  the file system name or the volume name.  When a user's
	  home directory gets trashed, restore it with:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs rollback storage/home@08-30-08</userinput></screen>

	<para>To get a list of all available snapshots, run
	  <command>ls</command> in the file system's
	  <filename class="directory">.zfs/snapshot</filename>
	  directory.  For example, to see the previously taken
	  snapshot:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ls /storage/home/.zfs/snapshot</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is possible to write a script to perform regular
	  snapshots on user data.  However, over time, snapshots
	  may consume a great deal of disk space.  The previous
	  snapshot may be removed using the following command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs destroy storage/home@08-30-08</userinput></screen>

	<para>After testing, <filename
	    class="directory">/storage/home</filename> can be made the
	  real <filename class="directory">/home</filename> using
	  this command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set mountpoint=/home storage/home</userinput></screen>

	<para>Run <command>df</command> and
	  <command>mount</command> to confirm that the system now
	  treats the file system as the real
	  <filename class="directory">/home</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount</userinput>

	<title>Data Verification</title>

	<para><acronym>ZFS</acronym> uses checksums to verify the

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set checksum=off storage/home</userinput></screen>

	<para>Doing so is <emphasis>not</emphasis> recommended as
	  checksums take very little storage space and are used to

	<title>ZFS Quotas</title>

	<para>ZFS supports different types of quotas: the refquota,
	  the general quota, the user quota, and the group quota.
	  This section explains the basics of each type and includes
	  some usage instructions.</para>

	<para>Quotas limit the amount of space that a dataset and its
	  descendants can consume, and enforce a limit on the amount
	  of space used by filesystems and snapshots for the
	  descendants.  Quotas are useful to limit the amount of space
	  a particular user can use.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the
	    <literal>volsize</literal> property acts as an implicit
	    quota.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The
	  <literal>refquota=<replaceable>size</replaceable></literal>
	  limits the amount of space a dataset can consume by
	  enforcing a hard limit on the space used.  However, this
	  hard limit does not include space used by descendants, such
	  as file systems or snapshots.</para>

	<para>To enforce a general quota of 10&nbsp;GB for
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename>, use the
	  following:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set quota=10G storage/home/bob</userinput></screen>

	<para>User quotas limit the amount of space that can be used
	  by the specified user.  The general format is
	  <literal>userquota@<replaceable>user</replaceable>=<replaceable>size</replaceable></literal>,
	  and the user's name must be in one of the following
	  formats:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><acronym
		role="Portable Operating System
	      Interface">POSIX</acronym> compatible name such as
	      <replaceable>joe</replaceable>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><acronym
		role="Portable Operating System
		Interface">POSIX</acronym>
	      numeric ID such as
	      <replaceable>789</replaceable>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><acronym role="System Identifier">SID</acronym> name
	      such as
	      <replaceable>joe.bloggs@example.com</replaceable>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><acronym role="System Identifier">SID</acronym>
	      numeric ID such as
	      <replaceable>S-1-123-456-789</replaceable>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>For example, to enforce a quota of 50&nbsp;GB for a user
	  named <replaceable>joe</replaceable>, use the
	  following:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set userquota@joe=50G</userinput></screen>

	<para>To remove the quota or make sure that one is not set,
	  instead use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set userquota@joe=none</userinput></screen>

	<para>User quota properties are not displayed by
	  <command>zfs get all</command>.
	  Non-<username>root</username> users can only see their own
	  quotas unless they have been granted the
	  <literal>userquota</literal> privilege.  Users with this
	  privilege are able to view and set everyone's quota.</para>

	<para>The group quota limits the amount of space that a
	  specified group can consume.  The general format is
	  <literal>groupquota@<replaceable>group</replaceable>=<replaceable>size</replaceable></literal>.</para>

	<para>To set the quota for the group
	  <replaceable>firstgroup</replaceable> to 50&nbsp;GB,
	  use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set groupquota@firstgroup=50G</userinput></screen>

	<para>To remove the quota for the group
	  <replaceable>firstgroup</replaceable>, or to make sure that
	  one is not set, instead use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set groupquota@firstgroup=none</userinput></screen>

	<para>As with the user quota property,
	  non-<username>root</username> users can only see the quotas
	  associated with the groups that they belong to.  However,
	  <username>root</username> or a user with the
	  <literal>groupquota</literal> privilege can view and set all
	  quotas for all groups.</para>

	<para>To display the amount of space consumed by each user on
	  the specified filesystem or snapshot, along with any
	  specified quotas, use <command>zfs userspace</command>.
	  For group information, use <command>zfs
	    groupspace</command>.  For more information about
	  supported options or how to display only specific options,
	  refer to &man.zfs.1;.</para>

	<para>Users with sufficient privileges and
	  <username>root</username> can list the quota for
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename> using:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs get quota storage/home/bob</userinput></screen>
      </sect3>

	<title>ZFS Reservations</title>

	<para>ZFS supports two types of space reservations.  This
	  section explains the basics of each and includes some usage
	  instructions.</para>

	<para>The <literal>reservation</literal> property makes it
	  possible to reserve a minimum amount of space guaranteed
	  for a dataset and its descendants.  This means that if a
	  10&nbsp;GB reservation is set on
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename>, if disk
	  space gets low, at least 10&nbsp;GB of space is reserved
	  for this dataset.  The <literal>refreservation</literal>
	  property sets or indicates the minimum amount of space
	  guaranteed to a dataset excluding descendants, such as
	  snapshots.  As an example, if a snapshot was taken of
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename>, enough disk space
	  would have to exist outside of the
	  <literal>refreservation</literal> amount for the operation
	  to succeed because descendants of the main data set are
	  not counted by the <literal>refreservation</literal>
	  amount and so do not encroach on the space set.</para>

	<para>Reservations of any sort are useful in many situations,
	  such as planning and testing the suitability of disk space
	  allocation in a new system, or ensuring that enough space is
	  available on file systems for system recovery procedures and
	  files.</para>

	<para>The general format of the <literal>reservation</literal>
	  property is
	  <literal>reservation=<replaceable>size</replaceable></literal>,
	  so to set a reservation of 10&nbsp;GB on
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename>, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set reservation=10G storage/home/bob</userinput></screen>

	<para>To make sure that no reservation is set, or to remove a
	  reservation, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs set reservation=none storage/home/bob</userinput></screen>

	<para>The same principle can be applied to the
	  <literal>refreservation</literal> property for setting a
	  refreservation, with the general format
	  <literal>refreservation=<replaceable>size</replaceable></literal>.</para>

	<para>To check if any reservations or refreservations exist on
	  <filename>storage/home/bob</filename>, execute one of the
	  following commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs get reservation storage/home/bob</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>zfs get refreservation storage/home/bob</userinput></screen>

  <sect1 id="filesystems-linux">
    <title>&linux; Filesystems</title>

    <para>This section describes some of the &linux; filesystems
      supported by &os;.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title><acronym>ext2</acronym></title>

      <para>The &man.ext2fs.5; file system kernel implementation has
	been available since &os;&nbsp;2.2.  In &os;&nbsp;8.x and
	earlier, the code is licensed under the
	<acronym>GPL</acronym>.  Since &os;&nbsp;9.0, the code has
	been rewritten and is now <acronym>BSD</acronym>
	licensed.</para>

      <para>The &man.ext2fs.5; driver allows the &os; kernel to both
	read and write to <acronym>ext2</acronym> file systems.</para>

      <para>To access an <acronym>ext2</acronym> file system, first
	load the kernel loadable module:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ext2fs</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then, to mount an &man.ext2fs.5; volume located on
	<filename>/dev/ad1s1</filename>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t ext2fs /dev/ad1s1 /mnt</userinput></screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>XFS</title>

      <para><acronym>XFS</acronym> was originally written by
	<acronym>SGI</acronym> for the <acronym>IRIX</acronym>
	operating system and was then ported to &linux; and
	released under the <acronym>GPL</acronym>.  See
	<ulink url="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs">this page</ulink>
	for more details.  The &os; port was started by Russel
	Cattelan, &a.kan.email;, and &a.rodrigc.email;.</para>

      <para>To load <acronym>XFS</acronym> as a kernel-loadable
	module:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload xfs</userinput></screen>

      <para>The &man.xfs.5; driver lets the &os; kernel access XFS
	filesystems.  However, only read-only access is supported and
	writing to a volume is not possible.</para>

      <para>To mount a &man.xfs.5; volume located on
	<filename>/dev/ad1s1</filename>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t xfs /dev/ad1s1 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>The <filename role="package">sysutils/xfsprogs</filename>
	port includes the <command>mkfs.xfs</command> which enables
	the creation of <acronym>XFS</acronym> filesystems, plus
	utilities for analyzing and repairing them.</para>

      <para>The <literal>-p</literal> flag to
	<command>mkfs.xfs</command> can be used to create an
	&man.xfs.5; filesystem which is populated with files and other
	metadata.  This can be used to quickly create a read-only
	filesystem which can be tested on &os;.</para>

      <title>ReiserFS</title>

      <para>The Reiser file system, ReiserFS, was ported to
	&os; by &a.dumbbell.email;, and has been released under the
	<acronym>GPL</acronym> .</para>

      <para>The ReiserFS driver permits the &os; kernel to access
	ReiserFS file systems and read their contents, but not
	write to them.</para>

      <para>First, the kernel-loadable module needs to be
	loaded:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload reiserfs</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then, to mount a ReiserFS volume located on

      XXXTR: stub sections (added later, as needed, as desire,

      Still need to discuss native and foreign file systems.

  <sect1>
    <title>DOS and NTFS File Systems</title>
    <para>This is a good section for those who transfer files, using
      USB devices, from Windows to FreeBSD and vice-versa.  My camera,
      and many other cameras I have seen default to using FAT16.  There
      is (was?) a kde utility, I think called kamera, that could be used
      to access camera devices.  A section on this would be useful.</para>

    <para>XXXTR: Though!  The disks chapter, covers a bit of this and
      devfs under it's USB devices.  It leaves a lot to be desired though,
      see:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/usb-disks.html
      It may be better to flesh out that section a bit more.  Add the
      word "camera" to it so that others can easily notice.</para>

    <title>Linux EXT File System</title>

    <para>Probably NOT as useful as the other two, but it requires
      knowledge of the existence of the tools.  Which are hidden in
      the ports collection.  Most Linux guys would probably only use
      Linux, BSD guys would be smarter and use NFS.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>HFS</title>

    <para>I think this is the file system used on Apple OSX.  There are
      tools in the ports collection, and with Apple being a big
      FreeBSD supporter and user of our technologies, surely there
      is enough cross over to cover this?</para>

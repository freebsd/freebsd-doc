    <para>File systems are an integral part of any operating system.
      They allow users to upload and store files, provide access to
      data, and make hard drives useful.  Different operating systems
      differ in their native file system.  Traditionally, the native
      &os; file system has been the Unix File System
      <acronym>UFS</acronym> which has been modernized as
      <acronym>UFS2</acronym>.  Since &os;&nbsp;7.0, the Z File System
      (<acronym>ZFS</acronym>) is also available as a native file
      system.  See <xref linkend="zfs"/> for more information.</para>

    <para>In addition to its native file systems, &os; supports a
      multitude of other file systems so that data from other
      operating systems can be accessed locally, such as data stored
      on locally attached <acronym>USB</acronym> storage devices,
      flash drives, and hard disks.  This includes support for the
      &linux; Extended File System (<acronym>EXT</acronym>).</para>

    <para>There are different levels of &os; support for the various
      file systems.  Some require a kernel module to be loaded and
      others may require a toolset to be installed.  Some non-native
      file system support is full read-write while others are
      read-only.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="filesystems-linux">
    <title>&linux; File Systems</title>

    <para>&os; provides built-in support for several &linux; file
      systems.  This section demonstrates how to load support for and
      how to mount the supported &linux; file systems.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title><acronym>ext2</acronym></title>

      <para>Kernel support for ext2 file systems has
	been available since &os;&nbsp;2.2.  In &os;&nbsp;8.x and
	earlier, the code is licensed under the
	<acronym>GPL</acronym>.  Since &os;&nbsp;9.0, the code has
	been rewritten and is now <acronym>BSD</acronym>
	licensed.</para>

      <para>The &man.ext2fs.5; driver allows the &os; kernel to both
	read and write to ext2 file systems.</para>

      <note>
	<para>This driver can also be used to access ext3 and ext4
	  file systems.  The &man.ext2fs.5; filesystem has full read
	  and write support for ext4 as of &os;&nbsp;12.0-RELEASE.
	  Additionally, extended attributes and ACLs are also
	  supported, while journalling and encryption are not.
	  Starting with &os;&nbsp;12.1-RELEASE, a DTrace provider will
	  be available as well.  Prior versions of &os; can access
	  ext4 in read and write mode using
	  <package>sysutils/fusefs-ext2</package>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To access an ext file system, first
	load the kernel loadable module:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ext2fs</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then, mount the ext volume by specifying its &os;
	partition name and an existing mount point.  This example
	mounts <filename>/dev/ad1s1</filename> on
	<filename>/mnt</filename>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t ext2fs <replaceable>/dev/ad1s1</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </sect2>

    <title>Device File System</title>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>DOS and NTFS File Systems</title>
    <para>This is a good section for those who transfer files, using
      USB devices, from Windows to FreeBSD and vice-versa.  My camera,
      and many other cameras I have seen default to using FAT16.  There
      is (was?) a kde utility, I think called kamera, that could be used
      to access camera devices.  A section on this would be useful.</para>

    <para>XXXTR: Though!  The disks chapter, covers a bit of this and
      devfs under it's USB devices.  It leaves a lot to be desired though,
      see:
https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/usb-disks.html
      It may be better to flesh out that section a bit more.  Add the
      word "camera" to it so that others can easily notice.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Linux EXT File System</title>

    <para>Probably NOT as useful as the other two, but it requires
      knowledge of the existence of the tools.  Which are hidden in
      the ports collection.  Most Linux guys would probably only use
      Linux, BSD guys would be smarter and use NFS.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>HFS</title>

    <para>I think this is the file system used on Apple OSX.  There are
      tools in the ports collection, and with Apple being a big
      FreeBSD supporter and user of our technologies, surely there
      is enough cross over to cover this?</para>

    <para>This chapter will provide a basic introduction to system security
      concepts, some general good rules of thumb, and some advanced topics
      under &os;.  A lot of the topics covered here can be applied
      to system and Internet security in general as well.  The Internet
      is no longer a <quote>friendly</quote> place in which everyone
      wants to be your kind neighbor.  Securing your system is imperative
      to protect your data, intellectual property, time, and much more

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Security is a function that begins and ends with the system
      administrator.  While all BSD &unix; multi-user systems have some
      inherent security, the job of building and maintaining additional
      security mechanisms to keep those users <quote>honest</quote> is
      probably one of the single largest undertakings of the sysadmin.
      Machines are only as secure as you make them, and security concerns
      are ever competing with the human necessity for convenience.  &unix;
      systems, in general, are capable of running a huge number of
      simultaneous processes and many of these processes operate as
      servers &mdash; meaning that external entities can connect and talk
      to them.  As yesterday's mini-computers and mainframes become
      today's desktops, and as computers become networked and
      inter-networked, security becomes an even bigger issue.</para>

    <para>System security also pertains to dealing with various forms of
      attack, including attacks that attempt to crash, or otherwise make a
      system unusable, but do not attempt to compromise the
      <username>root</username> account (<quote>break root</quote>).
      Security concerns
      can be split up into several categories:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Denial of service attacks.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>User account compromises.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Root compromise through accessible servers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Root compromise via user accounts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Backdoor creation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <indexterm>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>security</primary>
      <secondary>DoS attacks</secondary>
      <see>Denial of Service (DoS)</see>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>Denial of Service (DoS)</primary></indexterm>

    <para>A denial of service attack is an action that deprives the
      machine of needed resources.  Typically, DoS attacks are
      brute-force mechanisms that attempt to crash or otherwise make a
      machine unusable by overwhelming its servers or network stack.  Some
      DoS attacks try to take advantage of bugs in the networking
      stack to crash a machine with a single packet.  The latter can only
      be fixed by applying a bug fix to the kernel.  Attacks on servers
      can often be fixed by properly specifying options to limit the load
      the servers incur on the system under adverse conditions.
      Brute-force network attacks are harder to deal with.  A
      spoofed-packet attack, for example, is nearly impossible to stop,
      short of cutting your system off from the Internet.  It may not be
      able to take your machine down, but it can saturate your
      Internet connection.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>security</primary>
      <secondary>account compromises</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>A user account compromise is even more common than a DoS
      attack.  Many sysadmins still run standard 
      <application>telnetd</application>, <application>rlogind</application>,
      <application>rshd</application>,
      and <application>ftpd</application> servers on their machines.
      These servers, by default, do
      not operate over encrypted connections.  The result is that if you
      have any moderate-sized user base, one or more of your users logging
      into your system from a remote location (which is the most common
      and convenient way to login to a system) will have his or her
      password sniffed.  The attentive system admin will analyze his
      remote access logs looking for suspicious source addresses even for
      successful logins.</para>

    <para>One must always assume that once an attacker has access to a
      user account, the attacker can break <username>root</username>.
      However, the reality is that in a well secured and maintained system,
      access to a user account does not necessarily give the attacker
      access to <username>root</username>.  The distinction is important
      because without access to <username>root</username> the attacker
      cannot generally hide his tracks and may, at best, be able to do
      nothing more than mess with the user's files, or crash the machine.
      User account compromises are very common because users tend not to
      take the precautions that sysadmins take.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>security</primary>
      <secondary>backdoors</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>System administrators must keep in mind that there are
      potentially many ways to break <username>root</username> on a machine.
      The attacker may know the <username>root</username> password,
      the attacker may find a bug in a root-run server and be able
      to break <username>root</username> over a network
      connection to that server, or the attacker may know of a bug in
      a suid-root program that allows the attacker to break
      <username>root</username> once he has broken into a user's account.
      If an attacker has found a way to break <username>root</username>
      on a machine, the attacker may not have a need
      to install a backdoor.  Many of the <username>root</username> holes
      found and closed to date involve a considerable amount of work
      by the attacker to cleanup after himself, so most attackers install
      backdoors.  A backdoor provides the attacker with a way to easily
      regain <username>root</username> access to the system, but it
      also gives the smart system administrator a convenient way
      to detect the intrusion.
      Making it impossible for an attacker to install a backdoor may
      actually be detrimental to your security, because it will not
      close off the hole the attacker found to break in the first
      place.</para>


    <para>Security remedies should always be implemented with a
      multi-layered <quote>onion peel</quote> approach and can be
      categorized as follows:</para>

    <sect2 id="securing-root-and-staff">
      <title>Securing the <username>root</username> Account and
	Staff Accounts</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary><command>su</command></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>First off, do not bother securing staff accounts if you have
	not secured the <username>root</username> account.
	Most systems have a password assigned to the <username>root</username>
	account.  The first thing you do is assume
	that the password is <emphasis>always</emphasis> compromised.
	This does not mean that you should remove the password.  The
	password is almost always necessary for console access to the
	machine.  What it does mean is that you should not make it
	possible to use the password outside of the console or possibly
	even with the &man.su.1; command.  For example, make sure that
	your ptys are specified as being insecure in the
	<filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file so that direct
	<username>root</username> logins
	via <command>telnet</command> or <command>rlogin</command> are
	disallowed.  If using other login services such as
        <application>sshd</application>, make sure that direct
	<username>root</username> logins are disabled there as well.
	You can do this by editing
        your <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> file, and making
        sure that <literal>PermitRootLogin</literal> is set to
        <literal>no</literal>.  Consider every access method &mdash;
        services such as FTP often fall through the cracks.
	Direct <username>root</username> logins should only be allowed
	via the system console.</para>
      <indexterm>
        <primary><groupname>wheel</groupname></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Of course, as a sysadmin you have to be able to get to
	<username>root</username>, so we open up a few holes.
	But we make sure these holes require additional password
	verification to operate.  One way to make <username>root</username>
	accessible is to add appropriate staff accounts to the
	<groupname>wheel</groupname> group (in
	<filename>/etc/group</filename>).  The staff members placed in the
	<groupname>wheel</groupname> group are allowed to
	<command>su</command> to <username>root</username>.
	You should never give staff
	members native <groupname>wheel</groupname> access by putting them in the
	<groupname>wheel</groupname> group in their password entry.  Staff
	accounts should be placed in a <groupname>staff</groupname> group, and
	then added to the <groupname>wheel</groupname> group via the
	<filename>/etc/group</filename> file.  Only those staff members
	who actually need to have <username>root</username> access
	should be placed in the
	<groupname>wheel</groupname> group.  It is also possible, when using
	an authentication method such as Kerberos, to use Kerberos'
	<filename>.k5login</filename> file in the <username>root</username>
	account to allow a &man.ksu.1; to <username>root</username>
	without having to place anyone at all in the
	<groupname>wheel</groupname> group.  This may be the better solution
	since the <groupname>wheel</groupname> mechanism still allows an
	intruder to break <username>root</username> if the intruder
	has gotten hold of your
	password file and can break into a staff account.  While having
	the <groupname>wheel</groupname> mechanism is better than having
	nothing at all, it is not necessarily the safest option.</para>

      <para>To lock an account completely, the &man.pw.8; command should
	be used:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root;<userinput>pw lock <replaceable>staff</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>This will prevent the user from logging in using any
	mechanism, including &man.ssh.1;.</para>

      <para>Another method of blocking access to accounts would be to
	replace the encrypted password with a single
	<quote><literal>*</literal></quote> character.  This character
	would never match the encrypted password and thus block user
	access.  For example, the following staff account:</para>

      <programlisting>foobar:R9DT/Fa1/LV9U:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh</programlisting>

      <para>Should be changed to this:</para>

      <programlisting>foobar:*:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh</programlisting>

      <para>This will prevent the <username>foobar</username> user
	from logging in using conventional methods.  This method for
	access restriction is flawed on sites using
	<application>Kerberos</application> or in situations where the
	user has set up keys with &man.ssh.1;.</para>

      <para>These security mechanisms also assume that you are
	logging in from a more restrictive server to a less restrictive
	server.  For example, if your main box is running all sorts of
	servers, your workstation should not be running any.  In order for
	your workstation to be reasonably secure you should run as few
	servers as possible, up to and including no servers at all, and
	you should run a password-protected screen blanker.  Of course,
	given physical access to a workstation an attacker can break any
	sort of security you put on it.  This is definitely a problem that
	you should consider, but you should also consider the fact that the
	vast majority of break-ins occur remotely, over a network, from
	people who do not have physical access to your workstation or
	servers.</para>

      <para>Using something like Kerberos also gives you the ability to
	disable or change the password for a staff account in one place,
	and have it immediately affect all the machines on which the staff
	member may have an account.  If a staff member's account gets
	compromised, the ability to instantly change his password on all
	machines should not be underrated.  With discrete passwords,
	changing a password on N machines can be a mess.  You can also
	impose re-passwording restrictions with Kerberos:  not only can a
	Kerberos ticket be made to timeout after a while, but the Kerberos
	system can require that the user choose a new password after a
	certain period of time (say, once a month).</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para>The prudent sysadmin only runs the servers he needs to, no
	more, no less.  Be aware that third party servers are often the
	most bug-prone.  For example, running an old version of
	<application>imapd</application> or
	<application>popper</application> is like giving a universal
	<username>root</username> ticket out to the entire world.
	Never run a server that you have not checked out carefully.
	Many servers do not need to be run as <username>root</username>.
	For example, the <application>ntalk</application>,
	<application>comsat</application>, and
	<application>finger</application> daemons can be run in special
	user <firstterm>sandboxes</firstterm>.  A sandbox is not perfect,
	unless you go through a large amount of trouble, but the onion
	approach to security still stands: If someone is able to break
	in through a server running in a sandbox, they still have to
	break out of the sandbox.  The more layers the attacker must
	break through, the lower the likelihood of his success.  Root
	holes have historically been found in virtually every server
	ever run as <username>root</username>, including basic system servers.
	If you are running a machine through which people only login via
	<application>sshd</application> and never login via
	<application>telnetd</application> or
	<application>rshd</application> or
	<application>rlogind</application>, then turn off those
	services!</para>
      
      <para>&os; now defaults to running
	<application>ntalkd</application>,
	<application>comsat</application>, and
	<application>finger</application> in a sandbox.  Another program
	which may be a candidate for running in a sandbox is &man.named.8;.
	<filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> includes the arguments
	necessary to run <application>named</application> in a sandbox in a
	commented-out form.  Depending on whether you are installing a new
	system or upgrading an existing system, the special user accounts
	used by these sandboxes may not be installed.  The prudent
	sysadmin would research and implement sandboxes for servers
	whenever possible.</para>
      <indexterm>
        <primary><application>sendmail</application></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>There are a number of other servers that typically do not run
	in sandboxes: <application>sendmail</application>,
	<application>popper</application>,
	<application>imapd</application>, <application>ftpd</application>,
	and others.  There are alternatives to some of these, but
	installing them may require more work than you are willing to
	perform (the convenience factor strikes again).  You may have to
	run these servers as <username>root</username> and rely on other
	mechanisms to detect break-ins that might occur through them.</para>

      <para>The other big potential <username>root</username> holes in a
	system are the
	suid-root and sgid binaries installed on the system.  Most of
	these binaries, such as <application>rlogin</application>, reside
	in <filename class="directory">/bin</filename>, <filename
	class="directory">/sbin</filename>, <filename
	class="directory">/usr/bin</filename>, or <filename
	class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename>.
	While nothing is 100% safe, the system-default suid and sgid
	binaries can be considered reasonably safe.  Still,
	<username>root</username> holes are occasionally found in these
	binaries.  A <username>root</username> hole was found in
	<literal>Xlib</literal> in 1998 that made
	<application>xterm</application> (which is typically suid)
	vulnerable.  It is better to be safe than sorry and the prudent
	sysadmin will restrict suid binaries, that only staff should run,
	to a special group that only staff can access, and get rid of
	(<command>chmod 000</command>) any suid binaries that nobody uses.
	A server with no display generally does not need an
	<application>xterm</application> binary.  Sgid binaries can be
	almost as dangerous.  If an intruder can break an sgid-kmem binary,
	the intruder might be able to read <filename>/dev/kmem</filename>
	and thus read the encrypted password file, potentially compromising
	any passworded account.  Alternatively an intruder who breaks
	group <literal>kmem</literal> can monitor keystrokes sent through
	ptys, including ptys used by users who login through secure
	methods.  An intruder that breaks the <groupname>tty</groupname>
	group can write to
	almost any user's tty.  If a user is running a terminal program or
	emulator with a keyboard-simulation feature, the intruder can
	potentially generate a data stream that causes the user's terminal
	to echo a command, which is then run as that user.</para>

      <title>Securing User Accounts</title>

      <para>User accounts are usually the most difficult to secure.  While
	you can impose draconian access restrictions on your staff and
	<quote>star</quote> out their passwords, you may not be able to
	do so with any general user accounts you might have.  If you do
	have sufficient control, then you may win out and be able to secure
	the user accounts properly.  If not, you simply have to be more
	vigilant in your monitoring of those accounts.  Use of
	ssh and Kerberos for user accounts is
	more problematic, due to the extra administration and technical
	support required, but still a very good solution compared to a
	encrypted password file.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Securing the Password File</title>

      <para>The only sure fire way is to star out as many
	passwords as you can and use ssh or
	Kerberos for access to those accounts.  Even though the encrypted
	password file (<filename>/etc/spwd.db</filename>) can only be read
	by <username>root</username>, it may be possible for an intruder
	to obtain read access to that file even if the attacker cannot
	obtain root-write access.</para>

      <para>Your security scripts should always check for and report
	changes to the password file (see the <link

      <title>Securing the Kernel Core, Raw Devices, and
	File systems</title>

      <para>If an attacker breaks <username>root</username> he can do
        just about anything, but
	there are certain conveniences.  For example, most modern kernels
	have a packet sniffing device driver built in.  Under &os; it
	is called the <devicename>bpf</devicename> device.  An intruder
	will commonly attempt to run a packet sniffer on a compromised
	machine.  You do not need to give the intruder the capability and
	most systems do not have the need for the

        <primary><command>sysctl</command></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>But even if you turn off the <devicename>bpf</devicename>
	device, you still have
	<filename>/dev/mem</filename> and 
	<filename>/dev/kmem</filename>
	to worry about.  For that matter, the intruder can still write to
	raw disk devices.  Also, there is another kernel feature called
	the module loader, &man.kldload.8;.  An enterprising intruder can
	use a KLD module to install his own <devicename>bpf</devicename>
	device, or other sniffing
	device, on a running kernel.  To avoid these problems you have to
	run the kernel at a higher secure level, at least securelevel 1.</para>

      <para>The secure level of the kernel can be set in a variety of ways.
	The simplest way of raising the secure level of a running kernel is
	through a <command>sysctl</command> on
	the <varname>kern.securelevel</varname> kernel variable:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl kern.securelevel=<replaceable>1</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>By default, the &os; kernel boots with a secure level of -1.  The
	secure level will remain at -1 unless it is altered, either by the
	administrator or by &man.init.8; because of a setting in the start up
	scripts.  The secure level may be raised during system startup by
	setting the <varname>kern_securelevel_enable</varname> variable to
	<literal>YES</literal> in the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file,
	and the value of the <varname>kern_securelevel</varname> variable to
	the desired secure level.</para>

      <para>The default secure level of an &os; system right after the startup
	scripts are done is -1.  This is called <quote>insecure mode</quote>
	because immutable file flags may be turned off, all devices may be
	read from or written to, and so on.</para>

      <para>Once the secure level is set to 1 or a higher value, the
	append-only and immutable files are honored, they cannot be turned
	off, and access to raw devices will be denied.  Higher levels restrict
	even more operations.  For a full description of the effect of various
	secure levels, please read the &man.security.7; manual page (or the
	manual page of &man.init.8; in releases older than &os; 7.0).</para>

      <note>
	<para>Bumping the secure level to 1 or higher may cause a few problems
	  to X11 (access to <filename>/dev/io</filename> will be blocked), or
	  to the installation of &os; build from source
	  (the <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> part of the process needs
	  to temporarily reset the append-only and immutable flags of some
	  files), and in a few other cases.  Sometimes, as in the case of X11,
	  it may be possible to work around this by starting &man.xdm.1;
	  pretty early in the boot process, when the securelevel is still low
	  enough.  Workarounds like this may not be possible for all secure
	  levels or for all the potential restrictions they enforce.  A bit of
	  forward planning is a good idea.  Understanding the restrictions
	  imposed by each secure level is important as they severly diminish
	  the ease of system use.  It will also make choosing a default
	  setting much simpler and prevent any surprises.</para>
      </note>

      <para>If the kernel's secure level is raised to 1 or a higher value, it
	may be useful to set the <literal>schg</literal> flag on critical
	startup binaries, directories, and script files (i.e. everything that
	gets run up to the point where the securelevel is set).  This might be
	overdoing it, and upgrading the system is much more difficult when it
	operates at a high secure level.  A less strict compromise is to run
	the system at a higher secure level but skip setting
	the <literal>schg</literal> flag for every system file and directory
	under the sun.  Another possibility is to simply
	mount <filename class="directory">/</filename> and <filename
	class="directory">/usr</filename> read-only.
	It should be noted that being too draconian about what is permitted
	may prevent the all-important detection of an intrusion.</para>

      <title>Checking File Integrity: Binaries, Configuration Files,
	Etc.</title>

      <para>When it comes right down to it, you can only protect your core
	system configuration and control files so much before the
	convenience factor rears its ugly head.  For example, using
	<command>chflags</command> to set the <literal>schg</literal> bit
	on most of the files in <filename class="directory">/</filename> and
	<filename class="directory">/usr</filename> is probably
	counterproductive, because while it may protect the files, it also
	closes a detection window.
	The last layer of your security onion is perhaps the most
	important &mdash; detection.  The rest of your security is pretty
	much useless (or, worse, presents you with a false sense of
	security) if you cannot detect potential intrusions.  Half the job
	of the onion is to slow down the attacker, rather than stop him, in
	order to be able to catch him in the act.</para>

      <para>The best way to detect an intrusion is to look for modified,
	missing, or unexpected files.  The best way to look for modified
	files is from another (often centralized) limited-access system.
	Writing your security scripts on the extra-secure limited-access
	system makes them mostly invisible to potential attackers, and this
	is important.  In order to take maximum advantage you generally
	have to give the limited-access box significant access to the
	other machines in the business, usually either by doing a
	read-only NFS export of the other machines to the limited-access
	box, or by setting up ssh key-pairs to
	allow the limited-access box to ssh to
	the other machines.  Except for its network traffic, NFS is the
	least visible method &mdash; allowing you to monitor the
	file systems on each client box virtually undetected.  If your
	limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a
	switch, the NFS method is often the better choice.  If your
	limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a
	hub, or through several layers of routing, the NFS method may be
	too insecure (network-wise) and using
	ssh may be the better choice even with
	the audit-trail tracks that ssh
	lays.</para>

      <para>Once you have given a limited-access box at least read access to the
	client systems it is supposed to monitor, you must write scripts
	to do the actual monitoring.  Given an NFS mount, you can write
	scripts out of simple system utilities such as &man.find.1; and
	&man.md5.1;.  It is best to physically md5 the client-box files
	at least once a day, and to test control files such as those
	found in <filename class="directory">/etc</filename> and <filename
	class="directory">/usr/local/etc</filename> even more often.  When
	mismatches are found, relative to the base md5 information the
	limited-access machine knows is valid, it should scream at a
	sysadmin to go check it out.  A good security script will also
	check for inappropriate suid binaries and for new or deleted files
	on system partitions such as <filename class="directory">/</filename>
	and <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>.</para>

      <para>When using ssh rather than NFS,
	writing the security script is much more difficult.   You
	essentially have to <command>scp</command> the scripts to the client 
	box in order to
	run them, making them visible, and for safety you also need to
	<command>scp</command> the binaries (such as find) that those
	scripts use.  The <application>ssh</application> client on the
	client box may already be compromised.  All in all, using
	ssh may be necessary when running over
	insecure links, but it is also a lot harder to deal with.</para>

      <para>A good security script will also check for changes to user and
	staff members access configuration files:
	<filename>.rhosts</filename>, <filename>.shosts</filename>,
	<filename>.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> and so forth,
	files that might fall outside the purview of the
	<literal>MD5</literal> check.</para>

      <para>If you have a huge amount of user disk space, it may take too
	long to run through every file on those partitions.  In this case,
	setting mount flags to disallow suid binaries is a good idea.
	The <literal>nosuid</literal> option (see &man.mount.8;) is what you
	want to look into.  You should probably scan them anyway, at least
	once a week, since the object of this layer is to detect a break-in
	attempt, whether or not the attempt succeeds.</para>

      <para>Process accounting (see &man.accton.8;) is a relatively
	low-overhead feature of the operating system which might help
	as a post-break-in evaluation mechanism.  It is especially
	useful in tracking down how an intruder has actually broken into
	a system, assuming the file is still intact after the break-in has
	occured.</para>

      <para>Finally, security scripts should process the log files, and the
	logs themselves should be generated in as secure a manner as
	possible &mdash; remote syslog can be very useful.  An intruder
	will try to cover his tracks, and log files are critical to the
	sysadmin trying to track down the time and method of the initial
	break-in.  One way to keep a permanent record of the log files is
	to run the system console to a serial port and collect the
	information to a secure machine monitoring the consoles.</para>

      <title>Paranoia</title>

      <para>A little paranoia never hurts.  As a rule, a sysadmin can add
	any number of security features, as long as they do not affect
	convenience, and can add security features that
	<emphasis>do</emphasis> affect convenience with some added thought.
	Even more importantly, a security administrator should mix it up a
	bit &mdash; if you use recommendations such as those given by this
	document verbatim, you give away your methodologies to the
	prospective attacker who also has access to this document.</para>

      <title>Denial of Service Attacks</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Denial of Service (DoS)</primary></indexterm>

      <para>This section covers Denial of Service attacks.  A DoS attack
	is typically a packet attack.  While there is not much you can do
	about modern spoofed packet attacks that saturate your network,
	you can generally limit the damage by ensuring that the attacks
	cannot take down your servers by:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Limiting server forks.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Limiting springboard attacks (ICMP response attacks, ping
	    broadcast, etc.).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Overloading the Kernel Route Cache.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>A common DoS attack scenario is attacking a forking server and
	making it spawning so many child processes that the host system
	eventually runs out of memory, file descriptors, etc. and then
	grinds to a halt.  <application>inetd</application> 
	(see &man.inetd.8;) has several
	options to limit this sort of attack.  It should be noted that
	while it is possible to prevent a machine from going down, it is
	not generally possible to prevent a service from being disrupted
	by the attack.  Read the <application>inetd</application> manual
	page carefully and pay
	specific attention to the <option>-c</option>, <option>-C</option>,
	and <option>-R</option> options.  Note that spoofed-IP attacks
	will circumvent the <option>-C</option> option to 
	<application>inetd</application>, so
	typically a combination of options must be used.  Some standalone
	servers have self-fork-limitation parameters.</para>

      <para><application>Sendmail</application> has its
	<option>-OMaxDaemonChildren</option> option, which tends to work
	much better than trying to use <application>Sendmail</application>'s load limiting options
	due to the load lag.  You should specify a
	<literal>MaxDaemonChildren</literal> parameter, when you start
	<application>sendmail</application>; high enough to handle your
	expected load, but not so high that the computer cannot handle that
	number of <application>Sendmail</application> instances without falling on
	its face.  It is also prudent to run <application>Sendmail</application> in queued mode
	(<option>-ODeliveryMode=queued</option>) and to run the daemon
	(<command>sendmail -bd</command>) separate from the queue-runs
	(<command>sendmail -q15m</command>).  If you still want real-time
	delivery you can run the queue at a much lower interval, such as
	<option>-q1m</option>, but be sure to specify a reasonable
	<literal>MaxDaemonChildren</literal> option for
	<emphasis>that</emphasis> <application>Sendmail</application> to prevent cascade failures.</para>

      <para><application>Syslogd</application> can be attacked directly
	and it is strongly recommended that you use the <option>-s</option>
	option whenever possible, and the <option>-a</option> option
	otherwise.</para>

      <para>You should also be fairly careful with connect-back services
	such as <application>TCP Wrapper</application>'s reverse-identd,
	which can be attacked directly.  You generally do not want to use
	the reverse-ident feature of
	<application>TCP Wrapper</application> for this reason.</para>

      <para>It is a very good idea to protect internal services from
	external access by firewalling them off at your border routers.
	The idea here is to prevent saturation attacks from outside your
	LAN, not so much to protect internal services from network-based
	<username>root</username> compromise.
	Always configure an exclusive firewall, i.e.,
	<quote>firewall everything <emphasis>except</emphasis> ports A, B,
	C, D, and M-Z</quote>.  This way you can firewall off all of your
	low ports except for certain specific services such as
	<application>named</application> (if you are primary for a zone),
	<application>ntalkd</application>,
	<application>sendmail</application>, and other Internet-accessible
	services.  If you try to configure the firewall the other way
	&mdash; as an inclusive or permissive firewall, there is a good
	chance that you will forget to <quote>close</quote> a couple of
	services, or that you will add a new internal service and forget
	to update the firewall.  You can still open up the high-numbered
	port range on the firewall, to allow permissive-like operation,
	without compromising your low ports.  Also take note that &os;
	allows you to control the range of port numbers used for dynamic
	binding, via the various <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange</varname>
	<command>sysctl</command>'s (<command>sysctl -a | fgrep
	portrange</command>), which can also ease the complexity of your
	firewall's configuration.  For example, you might use a normal
	first/last range of 4000 to 5000, and a hiport range of 49152 to
	65535, then block off everything under 4000 in your firewall
	(except for certain specific Internet-accessible ports, of
	course).</para>

      <para>Another common DoS attack is called a springboard attack
	&mdash; to attack a server in a manner that causes the server to
	generate responses which overloads the server, the local
	network, or some other machine.  The most common attack of this
	nature is the <emphasis>ICMP ping broadcast attack</emphasis>.
	The attacker spoofs ping packets sent to your LAN's broadcast
	address with the source IP address set to the actual machine they
	wish to attack.  If your border routers are not configured to
	stomp on ping packets to broadcast addresses, your LAN winds up
	generating sufficient responses to the spoofed source address to
	saturate the victim, especially when the attacker uses the same
	trick on several dozen broadcast addresses over several dozen
	different networks at once.  Broadcast attacks of over a hundred
	and twenty megabits have been measured.  A second common
	springboard attack is against the ICMP error reporting system.
	By constructing packets that generate ICMP error responses, an
	attacker can saturate a server's incoming network and cause the
	server to saturate its outgoing network with ICMP responses.  This
	type of attack can also crash the server by running it out of
	memory, especially if the server cannot drain the ICMP responses
	it generates fast enough.
	Use the <application>sysctl</application>
	variable <literal>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</literal> to limit these attacks.
	The last major class of springboard
	attacks is related to certain internal 
	<application>inetd</application> services such as the
	udp echo service.  An attacker simply spoofs a UDP packet with the
	source address being server A's echo port, and the destination
	address being server B's echo port, where server A and B are both
	on your LAN.  The two servers then bounce this one packet back and
	forth between each other.  The attacker can overload both servers
	and their LANs simply by injecting a few packets in this manner.
	Similar problems exist with the internal 
	<application>chargen</application> port.  A
	competent sysadmin will turn off all of these inetd-internal test
	services.</para>

      <para>Spoofed packet attacks may also be used to overload the kernel
	route cache.  Refer to the <varname>net.inet.ip.rtexpire</varname>,
	<varname>rtminexpire</varname>, and <varname>rtmaxcache</varname>
	<command>sysctl</command> parameters.  A spoofed packet attack
	that uses a random source IP will cause the kernel to generate a
	temporary cached route in the route table, viewable with
	<command>netstat -rna | fgrep W3</command>.  These routes
	typically timeout in 1600 seconds or so.  If the kernel detects
	that the cached route table has gotten too big it will dynamically
	reduce the <varname>rtexpire</varname> but will never decrease it 
	to less than <varname>rtminexpire</varname>.  There are two 
	problems:</para>
	
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The kernel does not react quickly enough when a lightly
	    loaded server is suddenly attacked.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>The <varname>rtminexpire</varname> is not low enough for
	    the kernel to survive a sustained attack.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      
      <para>If your servers are connected to the Internet via a T3 or
        better, it may be prudent to manually override both
	<varname>rtexpire</varname> and <varname>rtminexpire</varname>
	via &man.sysctl.8;.  Never set either parameter to zero (unless
	you want to crash the machine).  Setting both
	parameters to 2 seconds should be sufficient to protect the route
	table from attack.</para>

      <title>Access Issues with Kerberos and SSH</title>
      <indexterm><primary><command>ssh</command></primary></indexterm>

      <para>There are a few issues with both Kerberos and
	ssh that need to be addressed if
	you intend to use them.  Kerberos 5 is an excellent
	authentication protocol, but there are bugs in the kerberized
	<application>telnet</application> and
	<application>rlogin</application> applications that make them
	unsuitable for dealing with binary streams.  Also, by default
	Kerberos does not encrypt a session unless you use the
	<option>-x</option> option.  <application>ssh</application>
	encrypts everything by default.</para>

      <para>Ssh works quite well in every
	respect except that it forwards encryption keys by default.  What
	this means is that if you have a secure workstation holding keys
	that give you access to the rest of the system, and you
	ssh to an insecure machine, your keys
	are usable.  The actual keys themselves are not exposed, but
	ssh installs a forwarding port for the
	duration of your login, and if an attacker has broken
	<username>root</username> on the
	insecure machine he can utilize that port to use your keys to gain
	access to any other machine that your keys unlock.</para>

      <para>We recommend that you use ssh in
	combination with Kerberos whenever possible for staff logins.
	<application>Ssh</application> can be compiled with Kerberos
	support.  This reduces your reliance on potentially exposed
	ssh keys while at the same time
	protecting passwords via Kerberos.  Ssh
	keys should only be used for automated tasks from secure machines
	(something that Kerberos is unsuited to do).  We also recommend that
	you either turn off key-forwarding in the
	ssh configuration, or that you make use
	of the <literal>from=IP/DOMAIN</literal> option that
	ssh allows in its
	<filename>authorized_keys</filename> file to make the key only
	usable to entities logging in from specific machines.</para>

    <para>Every user on a &unix; system has a password associated with
      their account.  It seems obvious that these passwords need to be
      known only to the user and the actual operating system.  In
      order to keep these passwords secret, they are encrypted with
      what is known as a <quote>one-way hash</quote>, that is, they can
      only be easily encrypted but not decrypted.  In other words, what
      we told you a moment ago was obvious is not even true:  the
      operating system itself does not <emphasis>really</emphasis> know
      the password.  It only knows the <emphasis>encrypted</emphasis>
      form of the password.  The only way to get the
      <quote>plain-text</quote> password is by a brute force search of the
      space of possible passwords.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately the only secure way to encrypt passwords when
      &unix; came into being was based on DES, the Data Encryption
      Standard.  This was not such a problem for users resident in
      the US, but since the source code for DES could not be exported
      outside the US, &os; had to find a way to both comply with 
      US law and retain compatibility with all the other &unix;
      variants that still used DES.</para>

    <para>The solution was to divide up the encryption libraries 
      so that US users could install the DES libraries and use
      DES but international users still had an encryption method
      that could be exported abroad.  This is how &os; came to
      use MD5 as its default encryption method.  MD5 is believed to
      be more secure than DES, so installing DES is offered primarily
      for compatibility reasons.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Recognizing Your Crypt Mechanism</title>

      <para>Currently the library supports DES, MD5 and Blowfish hash
	functions.  By default &os; uses MD5 to encrypt
	passwords.</para>

      <para>It is pretty easy to identify which encryption method 
	&os; is set up to use.  Examining the encrypted passwords in
	the <filename>/etc/master.passwd</filename> file is one way.
	Passwords encrypted with the MD5 hash are longer than those
	encrypted with the DES hash and also begin with the characters
	<literal>&dollar;1&dollar;</literal>.  Passwords starting with
	<literal>&dollar;2a&dollar;</literal> are encrypted with the
	Blowfish hash function.  DES password strings do not
	have any particular identifying characteristics, but they are
	shorter than MD5 passwords, and are coded in a 64-character
	alphabet which does not include the <literal>&dollar;</literal>
	character, so a relatively short string which does not begin with
	a dollar sign is very likely a DES password.</para>

      <para>The password format used for new passwords is controlled
	by the <literal>passwd_format</literal> login capability in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>, which takes values of
	<literal>des</literal>, <literal>md5</literal> or
	<literal>blf</literal>.  See the &man.login.conf.5; manual page
	for more information about login capabilities.</para>

    </indexterm>

    <para>By default, &os; includes support for OPIE (One-time Passwords
      In Everything), which uses the MD5 hash by default.</para>

    <para>There are three different sorts of passwords which we will discuss
      below.  The first is your usual &unix; style or
      Kerberos password; we will call this a <quote>&unix; password</quote>.
      The second sort is the one-time password which is generated by the OPIE
      &man.opiekey.1; program and accepted by the
      &man.opiepasswd.1; program
      and the login prompt; we will
      call this a <quote>one-time password</quote>.  The final sort of
      password is the secret password which you give to the
      <command>opiekey</command> program (and
      sometimes the
      <command>opiepasswd</command> programs)
      which it uses to generate
      one-time passwords; we will call it a <quote>secret password</quote>
      or just unqualified <quote>password</quote>.</para>

    <para>The secret password does not have anything to do with your &unix;
      password; they can be the same but this is not recommended.
      OPIE secret passwords are not limited to 8 characters like old
      &unix; passwords<footnote><para>Under &os; the standard login
      password may be up to 128 characters in length.</para></footnote>,
      they can be as long as you like.  Passwords of six or
      seven word long phrases are fairly common.  For the most part, the
      OPIE system operates completely independently of the &unix;
      password system.</para>

    <para>Besides the password, there are two other pieces of data that
      are important to OPIE.  One is what is known as the
      <quote>seed</quote> or <quote>key</quote>, consisting of two letters
      and five digits.  The other is what is called the <quote>iteration
      count</quote>, a number between 1 and 100.  OPIE creates the
      one-time password by concatenating the seed and the secret password,
      then applying the MD5 hash as many times as specified by the
      iteration count and turning the result into six short English words.
      These six English words are your one-time password.  The
      authentication system (primarily PAM) keeps
      track of the last one-time password used, and the user is
      authenticated if the hash of the user-provided password is equal to
      the previous password.  Because a one-way hash is used it is
      impossible to generate future one-time passwords if a successfully
      used password is captured; the iteration count is decremented after
      each successful login to keep the user and the login program in
      sync.  When the iteration count gets down to 1, OPIE must be
      reinitialized.</para>

    <para>There are a few programs involved in each system
      which we will discuss below.  The
      <command>opiekey</command> program accepts an iteration
      count, a seed, and a secret password, and generates a one-time
      password or a consecutive list of one-time passwords.  The
      <command>opiepasswd</command>
      program is used to initialize OPIE,
      and to change passwords, iteration counts, or seeds; it
      takes either a secret passphrase, or an iteration count,
      seed, and a one-time password.  The
      <command>opieinfo</command> program will examine the
      relevant credentials files
      (<filename>/etc/opiekeys</filename>) and print out the invoking user's
      current iteration count and seed.</para>

    <para>There are four different sorts of operations we will cover.  The
      first is using
      <command>opiepasswd</command> over a secure connection to set up
      one-time-passwords for the first time,  or to change your password
      or seed.  The second operation is using
      <command>opiepasswd</command> over an insecure connection, in
      conjunction with <command>opiekey</command>
      over a secure connection,  to do the same.  The third is using
      <command>opiekey</command> to log in over
      an insecure connection.  The fourth is using
      <command>opiekey</command> to generate a number of keys which
      can be written down or printed out to carry with you when going to
      some location without secure connections to anywhere.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Secure Connection Initialization</title>
      <para>To initialize OPIE for the first time, execute the
        <command>opiepasswd</command> command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>opiepasswd -c</userinput>
[grimreaper] ~ $ opiepasswd -f -c
Adding unfurl:
Only use this method from the console; NEVER from remote. If you are using
telnet, xterm, or a dial-in, type ^C now or exit with no password.
Then run opiepasswd without the -c parameter.

      <para>At the <prompt>Enter new secret pass phrase:</prompt> or
        <prompt>Enter secret password:</prompt> prompts, you
	should enter a password or phrase.  Remember, this is not the
	password that you will use to login with, this is used to generate
	your one-time login keys.  The <quote>ID</quote> line gives the
	parameters of your particular instance: your login name, the
        iteration count, and seed.  When logging in the system
	will remember these parameters and present them back to you so you
	do not have to remember them.  The last line gives the particular
	one-time password which corresponds to those parameters and your
	secret password; if you were to re-login immediately, this
	one-time password is the one you would use.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Insecure Connection Initialization</title>
      
      <para>To initialize or change your secret password over an
	insecure connection, you will need to already have a secure
	connection to some place where you can run
        <command>opiekey</command>; this might be in the form of a shell
	prompt on a machine you
	trust.  You will also need to make up an iteration count (100 is
	probably a good value), and you may make up your own seed or use a
	randomly-generated one.  Over on the insecure connection (to the
	machine you are initializing), use <command>opiepasswd</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>opiepasswd</userinput>

Updating unfurl:
You need the response from an OTP generator.

      <title>Generating a Single One-time Password</title>

      <para>Once you have initialized OPIE and login, you will be

      <para>As a side note, the OPIE prompts have a useful feature
	(not shown here): if you press <keycap>Return</keycap>
	at the password prompt, the
	prompter will turn echo on, so you can see what you are
	typing.  This can be extremely useful if you are attempting to
	type in a password by hand, such as from a printout.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>MacOS</primary></indexterm>

      <para>At this point you need to generate your one-time password to
	answer this login prompt.  This must be done on a trusted system
	that you can run
        <command>opiekey</command> on.  (There are versions of these for DOS,
	&windows; and &macos; as well.) They need the iteration count and
	the seed as command line options.  You can cut-and-paste these
        right from the login prompt on the machine that you are logging
        in to.</para>

      <title>Generating Multiple One-time Passwords</title>

      <para>Sometimes you have to go places where you do not have
	access to a trusted machine or secure connection.  In this case,
	it is possible to use the
	<command>opiekey</command> command to
	generate a number of one-time passwords beforehand to be printed
	out and taken with you.  For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>opiekey -n 5 30 zz99999</userinput>

    <title>TCP Wrappers</title>

    <para>Anyone familiar with &man.inetd.8; has probably heard
      of <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers at some point.  But few
      individuals seem to fully comprehend its usefulness in a
      network environment.  It seems that everyone wants to
      install a firewall to handle network connections.  While a
      firewall has a wide variety of uses, there are some things
      that a firewall will not handle, such as sending text back to the
      connection originator.  The <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers software
      does this and much more.  In the next few sections many of
      the <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers features will be discussed,
      and, when applicable, example configuration lines will be
      provided.</para>

    <para>The <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers software extends the
      abilities of <application>inetd</application> to provide support for
      every server daemon under its control.  Using this method it
      is possible to provide logging support, return messages to
      connections, permit a daemon to only accept internal connections,
      etc.  While some of these features can be provided by implementing
      a firewall, this will add not only an extra layer of protection
      but go beyond the amount of control a firewall can
      provide.</para>

    <para>The added functionality of <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers
      should not be considered a replacement for a good firewall.
      <acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers can be used in conjunction
      with a firewall or other security enhancements though and
      it can serve nicely as an extra layer of protection
      for the system.</para>

    <para>Since this is an extension to the configuration of
      <application>inetd</application>, the reader is expected have
      read the <link linkend="network-inetd">inetd configuration</link>
      section.</para>

    <note>
      <para>While programs run by &man.inetd.8; are not exactly
	<quote>daemons</quote>, they have traditionally been called
	daemons.  This is the term we will use in this section too.</para>
    </note>

    <sect2>
      <title>Initial Configuration</title>

      <para>The only requirement of using <acronym>TCP</acronym>
	Wrappers in &os; is to ensure the <application>inetd</application>
	server is started from <filename>rc.conf</filename> with the
	<option>-Ww</option> option; this is the default setting.  Of
	course,	proper configuration of
	<filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename> is also expected, but
	&man.syslogd.8; will throw messages in the system logs in
	these cases.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Unlike other implementations of <acronym>TCP</acronym>
	  Wrappers, the use of <filename>hosts.deny</filename> has
	  been deprecated.  All configuration options should be placed
	  in <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>In the simplest configuration, daemon connection policies
	are set to either be permitted or blocked depending on the
	options in <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.  The default
	configuration in &os; is to allow a connection to every daemon
	started with <application>inetd</application>.  Changing this will be
	discussed only after the basic configuration is covered.</para>

      <para>Basic configuration usually takes the form of
	<literal>daemon : address : action</literal>.  Where
	<literal>daemon</literal> is the daemon name which
	<command>inetd</command> started.  The
	<literal>address</literal> can be a valid hostname, an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address or an IPv6 address enclosed in
	brackets ([&nbsp;]).  The <literal>action</literal> field can be either <literal>allow</literal>
	or <literal>deny</literal> to grant or deny access appropriately.  Keep in mind
	that configuration works off a first rule match semantic,
	meaning that the configuration file is scanned in ascending
	order for a matching rule.  When a match is found the rule
	is applied and the search process will halt.</para>

      <para>Several other options exist but they will be explained
	in a later section.  A simple configuration line may easily be
	constructed from that information alone.  For example, to
	allow <acronym>POP</acronym>3 connections via the
	<filename role="package">mail/qpopper</filename> daemon,
	the following lines should be appended to
	<filename>hosts.allow</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting># This line is required for POP3 connections:
qpopper : ALL : allow</programlisting>

      <para>After adding this line, <application>inetd</application> will need
	to be restarted.  This can be accomplished by use of the &man.kill.1;
	command, or with the <parameter>restart</parameter> parameter
	with <filename>/etc/rc.d/inetd</filename>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Advanced Configuration</title>

      <para><acronym>TCP</acronym> Wrappers has advanced
	options too; they will allow for more control over the
	way connections are handled.  In some cases it may be
	a good idea to return a comment to certain hosts or
	daemon connections.  In other cases, perhaps a log file
	should be recorded or an email sent to the administrator.
	Other situations may require the use of a service for local
	connections only.  This	is all possible through the use of
	configuration options known as <literal>wildcards</literal>,
	expansion characters and external command execution.  The
	next two sections are written to cover these situations.</para>
	
      <sect3>
	<title>External Commands</title>

	<para>Suppose that a situation occurs where a connection
	  should be denied yet a reason should be sent to the
	  individual who attempted to establish that connection.  How
	  could it be done?  That action can be made possible by
	  using the <option>twist</option> option.  When a connection
	  attempt is made, <option>twist</option> will be called to
	  execute a shell command or script.  An example already exists
	  in the <filename>hosts.allow</filename> file:</para>

	<programlisting># The rest of the daemons are protected.
ALL : ALL \
        : severity auth.info \
        : twist /bin/echo "You are not welcome to use %d from %h."</programlisting>

	<para>This example shows that the message,
	  <quote>You are not allowed to use <literal>daemon</literal>
	  from <literal>hostname</literal>.</quote> will be returned
	  for any daemon not previously configured in the access file.
	  This is extremely useful for sending a reply back to the
	  connection initiator right after the established connection
	  is dropped.  Note that any message returned
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> be wrapped in quote
	  <literal>"</literal> characters; there are no exceptions to
	  this rule.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>It may be possible to launch a denial of service attack
	    on the server if an attacker, or group of attackers could
	    flood these daemons with connection requests.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>Another possibility is to use the <option>spawn</option>
	  option in these cases.  Like <option>twist</option>, the
	  <option>spawn</option> option implicitly denies the connection and
	  may be used to run external shell commands or scripts.
	  Unlike <option>twist</option>, <option>spawn</option> will
	  not send a reply back to the individual who established the
	  connection.  For an example, consider the following
	  configuration line:</para>

	<programlisting># We do not allow connections from example.com:
ALL : .example.com \
	: spawn (/bin/echo %a from %h attempted to access %d &gt;&gt; \
	  /var/log/connections.log) \
	: deny</programlisting>

	<para>This will deny all connection attempts from the
	  <hostid role="fqdn">*.example.com</hostid> domain;
	  simultaneously logging the hostname, <acronym>IP</acronym>
	  address and the daemon which they attempted to access in the
	  <filename>/var/log/connections.log</filename> file.</para>

	<para>Aside from the already explained substitution characters
	  above, e.g. <literal>%a</literal>, a few others exist.  See the
	  &man.hosts.access.5; manual page for the complete list.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Wildcard Options</title>

	<para>Thus far the <literal>ALL</literal> option has been used
	  continuously throughout the examples.  Other options exist
	  which could extend the functionality a bit further.  For
	  instance, <literal>ALL</literal> may be used to match every
	  instance of either a daemon, domain or an
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address. Another wildcard available is
	  <literal>PARANOID</literal> which may be used to match any
	  host which provides an <acronym>IP</acronym> address that may
	  be forged.  In other words, <literal>PARANOID</literal> may
	  be used to define an action to be taken whenever a connection
	  is made from an <acronym>IP</acronym> address that differs
	  from its hostname.  The following example may shed some more
	  light on this discussion:</para>

	<programlisting># Block possibly spoofed requests to sendmail:
sendmail : PARANOID : deny</programlisting>

	<para>In that example all connection requests to
	  <command>sendmail</command> which have an
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address that varies from its hostname
	  will be denied.</para>

	<caution>
	  <para>Using the <literal>PARANOID</literal> wildcard may severely
	    cripple servers if the client or server has a broken
	    <acronym>DNS</acronym> setup.  Administrator discretion
	    is advised.</para>
	</caution>

	<para>To learn more about wildcards and their associated
	  functionality, see the &man.hosts.access.5; manual
	  page.</para>

	<para>Before any of the specific configuration lines above will
	  work, the first configuration line should be commented out
	  in <filename>hosts.allow</filename>.  This was noted at the
	  beginning of this section.</para>

    <title><application>Kerberos5</application></title>

    <para><application>Kerberos</application> is a network add-on
      system/protocol that allows users to authenticate themselves
      through the services of a secure server.  Services such as remote
      login, remote copy, secure inter-system file copying and other
      high-risk tasks are made considerably safer and more
      controllable.</para>

    <para><application>Kerberos</application> can be described as an
      identity-verifying proxy system.  It can also be described as a
      trusted third-party authentication system.
      <application>Kerberos</application> provides only one
      function &mdash; the secure authentication of users on the network.
      It does not provide authorization functions (what users are
      allowed to do) or auditing functions (what those users did).
      After a client and server have used
      <application>Kerberos</application> to prove their identity, they
      can also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy
      and data integrity as they go about their business.</para>

    <para>Therefore it is highly recommended that
      <application>Kerberos</application> be used with other security
      methods which provide authorization and audit services.</para>

    <para>The following instructions can be used as a guide on how to set
      up <application>Kerberos</application> as distributed for &os;.
      However, you should refer to the relevant manual pages for a complete
      description.</para>

    <para>For purposes of demonstrating a <application>Kerberos</application>

      </indexterm>

      <para><application>Kerberos</application> was created by
	<acronym>MIT</acronym> as a solution to network security problems.
	The <application>Kerberos</application> protocol uses strong
	cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server
	(and vice versa) across an insecure network connection.</para>

      <para><application>Kerberos</application> is both the name of a
	network authentication protocol and an adjective to describe
	programs that implement the program
	(<application>Kerberos</application> telnet, for example).  The
	current version of the protocol is version 5, described in
	<acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1510.</para>

      <para>Several free implementations of this protocol are available,
	covering a wide range of operating systems.  The Massachusetts
	Institute of Technology (<acronym>MIT</acronym>), where
	<application>Kerberos</application> was originally developed,
	continues to develop their <application>Kerberos</application>
	package.  It is commonly used in the <acronym>US</acronym>
	as a cryptography product, as such it
	has historically been affected by <acronym>US</acronym> export
	regulations.  The <acronym>MIT</acronym>
	<application>Kerberos</application> is available as a port
	(<filename role="package">security/krb5</filename>).  Heimdal
	<application>Kerberos</application> is another version 5
	implementation, and was explicitly developed outside of the
	<acronym>US</acronym> to avoid export
	regulations (and is thus often included in non-commercial &unix;
	variants).  The Heimdal <application>Kerberos</application>
	distribution is available as a port
	(<filename role="package">security/heimdal</filename>), and a
	minimal installation of it is included in the base &os;
	install.</para>

      <para>The Key Distribution Center (<acronym>KDC</acronym>) is the
	centralized authentication service that
	<application>Kerberos</application> provides &mdash; it is the
	computer that issues <application>Kerberos</application> tickets.
	The <acronym>KDC</acronym> is considered <quote>trusted</quote> by
	all other computers in the <application>Kerberos</application>
	realm, and thus has heightened security concerns.</para>

    <para>Note that while running the <application>Kerberos</application>
	server requires very few computing resources, a dedicated machine
	acting only as a <acronym>KDC</acronym> is recommended for security
	reasons.</para>

    <para>To begin setting up a <acronym>KDC</acronym>, ensure that your
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file contains the correct
	settings to act as a <acronym>KDC</acronym> (you may need to adjust
	paths to reflect your own system):</para>

    <programlisting>kerberos5_server_enable="YES"
kadmind5_server_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Next we will set up your <application>Kerberos</application>
	config file, <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>[libdefaults]
    default_realm = EXAMPLE.ORG
[realms]
    EXAMPLE.ORG = {

        admin_server = kerberos.example.org
    }
[domain_realm]
    .example.org = EXAMPLE.ORG</programlisting>

      <para>Note that this <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file implies
	that your <acronym>KDC</acronym> will have the fully-qualified
	hostname of <hostid role="fqdn">kerberos.example.org</hostid>.
	You will need to add a CNAME (alias) entry to your zone file to
	accomplish this if your <acronym>KDC</acronym> has a different
	hostname.</para>

      <note>
	<para>For large networks with a properly configured
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym> <acronym>DNS</acronym> server, the

      </note>

      <para>Next we will create the <application>Kerberos</application>
	database.  This database contains the keys of all principals encrypted
	with a master password.  You are not
	required to remember this password, it will be stored in a file
	(<filename>/var/heimdal/m-key</filename>).  To create the master
	key, run <command>kstash</command> and enter a password.</para>

      <para>Once the master key has been created, you can initialize the
	database using the <command>kadmin</command> program with the
	<literal>-l</literal> option (standing for <quote>local</quote>).
	This option instructs <command>kadmin</command> to modify the
	database files directly rather than going through the
	<command>kadmind</command> network service.  This handles the
	chicken-and-egg problem of trying to connect to the database
	before it is created.  Once you have the <command>kadmin</command>
	prompt, use the <command>init</command> command to create your
	realms initial database.</para>

      <para>Lastly, while still in <command>kadmin</command>, create your
	first principal using the <command>add</command> command.  Stick
	to the defaults options for the principal for now, you can always
	change them later with the <command>modify</command> command.
	Note that you can use the <literal>?</literal> command at any
	prompt to see the available options.</para>

        <indexterm>
	  <primary>Kerberos5</primary>
	  <secondary>enabling services</secondary>
        </indexterm>

	<para>First, we need a copy of the <application>Kerberos</application>
	  configuration file, <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>.  To do
	  so, simply copy it over to the client computer from the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym> in a secure fashion (using network utilities,
	  such as &man.scp.1;, or physically via a
	  floppy disk).</para>

	<para>Next you need a <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename> file.
	  This is the major difference between a server providing
	  <application>Kerberos</application> enabled daemons and a
	  workstation &mdash; the server must have a
	  <filename>keytab</filename> file.  This file
	  contains the server's host key, which allows it and the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym> to verify each others identity.  It
	  must be transmitted to the server in a secure fashion, as the
	  security of the server can be broken if the key is made public.
	  This explicitly means that transferring it via a clear text
	  channel, such as <acronym>FTP</acronym>, is a very bad idea.</para>

	<para>Typically, you transfer to the <filename>keytab</filename>
	  to the server using the <command>kadmin</command> program.
	  This is handy because you also need to create the host principal
	  (the <acronym>KDC</acronym> end of the
	  <filename>krb5.keytab</filename>) using
	  <command>kadmin</command>.</para>

	<para>Note that you must have already obtained a ticket and that this
	  ticket must be allowed to use the <command>kadmin</command>
	  interface in the <filename>kadmind.acl</filename>.  See the section
	  titled <quote>Remote administration</quote> in the Heimdal info
	  pages (<command>info heimdal</command>) for details on designing
	  access control lists.  If you do not want to enable remote
	  <command>kadmin</command> access, you can simply securely connect
	  to the <acronym>KDC</acronym> (via local console,
	  &man.ssh.1; or <application>Kerberos</application>
	  &man.telnet.1;) and perform administration locally
	  using <command>kadmin -l</command>.</para>

	<para>After installing the <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file,
	  you can use <command>kadmin</command> from the
	  <application>Kerberos</application> server.  The
	  <command>add --random-key</command> command will let you add the
	  server's host principal, and the <command>ext</command> command
	  will allow you to extract the server's host principal to its own
	  keytab.  For example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kadmin</userinput>
kadmin><userinput> add --random-key host/myserver.example.org</userinput>
Max ticket life [unlimited]:
Max renewable life [unlimited]:
Attributes []:
kadmin><userinput> ext host/myserver.example.org</userinput>
kadmin><userinput> exit</userinput></screen>

	<para>Note that the <command>ext</command> command (short for
	  <quote>extract</quote>) stores the extracted key in
	  <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename> by default.</para>

	<para>If you do not have <command>kadmind</command> running on the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym> (possibly for security reasons) and thus
	  do not have access to <command>kadmin</command> remotely, you
	  can add the host principal
	  (<username>host/myserver.EXAMPLE.ORG</username>) directly on the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym> and then extract it to a temporary file
	  (to avoid over-writing the <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename>
	  on the <acronym>KDC</acronym>) using something like this:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kadmin</userinput>
kadmin><userinput> ext --keytab=/tmp/example.keytab host/myserver.example.org</userinput>
kadmin><userinput> exit</userinput></screen>

	<para>You can then securely copy the keytab to the server
	  computer (using <command>scp</command> or a floppy, for
	  example).  Be sure to specify a non-default keytab name
	  to avoid over-writing the keytab on the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym>.</para>

	<para>At this point your server can communicate with the
	  <acronym>KDC</acronym> (due to its <filename>krb5.conf</filename>
	  file) and it can prove its own identity (due to the
	  <filename>krb5.keytab</filename> file).  It is now ready for
	  you to enable some <application>Kerberos</application> services.
	  For this example we will enable the <command>telnet</command>
	  service by putting a line like this into your
	  <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> and then restarting the
	  &man.inetd.8; service with
	  <command>/etc/rc.d/inetd restart</command>:</para>

	<programlisting>telnet    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/telnetd  telnetd -a user</programlisting>

	<para>The critical bit is that the <command>-a</command>
	  (for authentication) type is set to user.  Consult the
	  &man.telnetd.8; manual page for more details.</para>

	<para>Setting up a client computer is almost trivially easy.  As
	  far as <application>Kerberos</application> configuration goes,
	  you only need the <application>Kerberos</application>
	  configuration file, located at <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>.
	  Simply securely copy it over to the client computer from the

	<para>Test your client computer by attempting to use
	  <command>kinit</command>, <command>klist</command>, and
	  <command>kdestroy</command> from the client to obtain, show, and
	  then delete a ticket for the principal you created above.  You
	  should also be able to use <application>Kerberos</application>
	  applications to connect to <application>Kerberos</application>
	  enabled servers, though if that does not work and obtaining a
	  ticket does the problem is likely with the server and not with
	  the client or the <acronym>KDC</acronym>.</para>

	<para>When testing an application like <command>telnet</command>,
	  try using a packet sniffer (such as &man.tcpdump.1;)
	  to confirm that your password is not sent in the clear.  Try
	  using <command>telnet</command> with the <literal>-x</literal>
	  option, which encrypts the entire data stream (similar to
	  <command>ssh</command>).</para>

	<para>Various non-core <application>Kerberos</application> client
	  applications are also installed by default.  This is where the
	  <quote>minimal</quote> nature of the base Heimdal installation is
	  felt: <command>telnet</command> is the only
	  <application>Kerberos</application> enabled service.</para>

	<para>The Heimdal port adds some of the missing client applications:
	  <application>Kerberos</application> enabled versions of
	  <command>ftp</command>, <command>rsh</command>,
	  <command>rcp</command>, <command>rlogin</command>, and a few

	  or a principal.</para>

	<para>Occasionally, however, you want to grant access to a local
	  user account to someone who does not have a matching
	  <application>Kerberos</application> principal.  For example,
	  <username>tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG</username> may need access to the
	  local user account <username>webdevelopers</username>.  Other
	  principals may also need access to that local account.</para>

	<para>The <filename>.k5login</filename> and
	  <filename>.k5users</filename> files, placed in a users home
	  directory, can be used similar to a powerful combination of
	  <filename>.hosts</filename> and <filename>.rhosts</filename>,
	  solving this problem. For example, if a

jdoe@example.org</screen>

	<para>Were to be placed into the home directory of the local user

	<para>The major difference between the <acronym>MIT</acronym>

	  program which has a different (but equivalent) set of commands
	  and uses a different protocol.  This has a large implications
	  if your <acronym>KDC</acronym> is <acronym>MIT</acronym> as you
	  will not be able to use the Heimdal <command>kadmin</command>
	  program to administer your <acronym>KDC</acronym> remotely
	  (or vice versa, for that matter).</para>

	<para>The client applications may also take slightly different
	  command line options to accomplish the same tasks.  Following
	  the instructions on the <acronym>MIT</acronym>
	  <application>Kerberos</application> web site
	  (<ulink url="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/"></ulink>)
	  is recommended. Be careful of path issues: the

	    could be stolen and re-used.  An example of this would be
	    <application>Kerberos</application> enabling all remote shells
	    (via <command>rsh</command> and <command>telnet</command>, for
	    example) but not converting the <acronym>POP3</acronym> mail
	    server which sends passwords in plain text.</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title><application>Kerberos</application> is intended for single-user workstations</title>

	  <para>In a multi-user environment,
	    <application>Kerberos</application> is less secure.
	    This is because it stores the tickets in the <filename 
	    class="directory">/tmp</filename> directory, which is readable by 
	    all users.  If a user is sharing a computer with several other
	    people simultaneously (i.e. multi-user), it is possible that
	    the user's tickets can be stolen (copied) by another
	    user.</para>

	  <para>This can be overcome with the <literal>-c</literal>
	    filename command-line option or (preferably) the
	    <envar>KRB5CCNAME</envar> environment variable, but this
	    is rarely done. In principal, storing the ticket in the users
	    home directory and using simple file permissions can mitigate
	    this problem.</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title>The KDC is a single point of failure</title>

	  <para>By design, the <acronym>KDC</acronym> must be as secure as
	    the master password database is contained on it.  The
	    <acronym>KDC</acronym> should have absolutely no other
	    services running on it and should be physically secured.  The
	    danger is high because <application>Kerberos</application>
	    stores all passwords encrypted with the same key (the
	    <quote>master</quote> key), which in turn is stored as a file
	    on the <acronym>KDC</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>As a side note, a compromised master key is not quite as
	    bad as one might normally fear.  The master key is only used
	    to encrypt the <application>Kerberos</application> database
	    and as a seed for the random number generator.  As long as
	    access to your <acronym>KDC</acronym> is secure, an attacker
	    cannot do much with the master key.</para>

	  <para>Additionally, if the <acronym>KDC</acronym> is unavailable
	    (perhaps due to a denial of service attack or network problems)
	    the network services are unusable as authentication can not be
	    performed, a recipe for a denial-of-service attack.  This can
	    alleviated with multiple <acronym>KDC</acronym>s (a single
	    master and one or more slaves) and with careful implementation
	    of secondary or fall-back authentication
	    (<acronym>PAM</acronym> is excellent for this).</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title><application>Kerberos</application> Shortcomings</title>

	  <para><application>Kerberos</application> allows users, hosts
	    and services to authenticate between themselves.  It does not
	    have a mechanism to authenticate the <acronym>KDC</acronym>
	    to the users, hosts or services.  This means that a trojanned
	    <command>kinit</command> (for example) could record all user
	    names and passwords.  Something like
	    <filename role="package">security/tripwire</filename> or
	    other file system integrity checking tools can alleviate
	    this.</para>

    <indexterm>

      <secondary>OpenSSL</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>One feature that many users overlook is the
      <application>OpenSSL</application> toolkit included
      in &os;.  <application>OpenSSL</application> provides an
      encryption transport layer on top of the normal communications
      layer; thus allowing it to be intertwined with many network
      applications and services.</para>

    <para>Some uses of <application>OpenSSL</application> may include
      encrypted authentication of mail clients, web based transactions
      such as credit card payments and more.  Many ports such as
      <filename role="package">www/apache13-ssl</filename>, and
      <filename role="package">mail/claws-mail</filename>
      will offer compilation support for building with
      <application>OpenSSL</application>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>In most cases the Ports Collection will attempt to build
	the <filename role="package">security/openssl</filename> port
	unless the <makevar>WITH_OPENSSL_BASE</makevar> make variable
	is explicitly set to <quote>yes</quote>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The version of <application>OpenSSL</application> included
      in &os; supports Secure Sockets Layer v2/v3 (SSLv2/SSLv3),
      Transport Layer Security v1 (TLSv1) network security protocols
      and can be used as a general cryptographic library.</para>

    <note>
      <para>While <application>OpenSSL</application> supports the
	<acronym>IDEA</acronym> algorithm, it is disabled by default
	due to United States patents.  To use it, the license should
	be reviewed and, if the restrictions are acceptable, the
	<makevar>MAKE_IDEA</makevar> variable must be set in
	<filename>make.conf</filename>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>One of the most common uses of
      <application>OpenSSL</application> is to provide certificates for
      use with software applications.  These certificates ensure
      that the credentials of the company or individual are valid
      and not fraudulent.  If the certificate in question has
      not been verified by one of the several <quote>Certificate Authorities</quote>,
      or <acronym>CA</acronym>s, a warning is usually produced.  A
      Certificate Authority is a company, such as <ulink url="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</ulink>, which will
      sign certificates in order to validate credentials of individuals
      or companies.  This process has a cost associated with it and
      is definitely not a requirement for using certificates; however,
      it can put some of the more paranoid users at ease.</para>

      <title>Generating Certificates</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>OpenSSL</primary>
	<secondary>certificate generation</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>To generate a certificate, the following command is
	available:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>openssl req -new -nodes -out req.pem -keyout cert.pem</userinput>
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
................++++++
.......................................++++++
writing new private key to 'cert.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:<userinput><replaceable>US</replaceable></userinput>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:<userinput><replaceable>PA</replaceable></userinput>
Locality Name (eg, city) []:<userinput><replaceable>Pittsburgh</replaceable></userinput>
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<userinput><replaceable>My Company</replaceable></userinput>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:<userinput><replaceable>Systems Administrator</replaceable></userinput>
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:<userinput><replaceable>localhost.example.org</replaceable></userinput>
Email Address []:<userinput><replaceable>trhodes@FreeBSD.org</replaceable></userinput>

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:<userinput><replaceable>SOME PASSWORD</replaceable></userinput>
An optional company name []:<userinput><replaceable>Another Name</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Notice the response directly after the
	<quote>Common Name</quote> prompt shows a domain name.
	This prompt requires a server name to be entered for
	verification purposes; placing anything	but a domain name
	would yield a useless certificate.  Other options, for
	instance expire time, alternate encryption algorithms, etc.
	are available.  A complete list may be obtained by viewing
	the &man.openssl.1; manual page.</para>

      <para>Two files should now exist in
	the directory in which the aforementioned command was issued.
	The certificate request, <filename>req.pem</filename>, may be
	sent to a certificate authority who will validate the credentials
	that you entered, sign the request and return the certificate to
	you.  The second file created will be named <filename>cert.pem</filename>
	and is the private key for the certificate and should be
	protected at all costs; if this falls in the hands of others it
	can be used to impersonate you (or your server).</para>

      <para>In cases where a signature from a <acronym>CA</acronym> is
	not required, a self signed certificate can be created.  First,
	generate the <acronym>RSA</acronym> key:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>openssl dsaparam -rand -genkey -out <filename>myRSA.key</filename> 1024</userinput></screen>
	
	<para>Next, generate the <acronym>CA</acronym> key:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>openssl gendsa -des3 -out <filename>myca.key</filename> <filename>myRSA.key</filename></userinput></screen>

      <para>Use this key to create the certificate:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key <filename>myca.key</filename> -out <filename>new.crt</filename></userinput></screen>

      <para>Two new files should appear in the directory: a certificate
	authority signature file, <filename>myca.key</filename> and the
	certificate itself, <filename>new.crt</filename>.  These should
	be placed in a directory, preferably under
	<filename class="directory">/etc</filename>, which is readable
	only by <username>root</username>.  Permissions of 0700 should be fine for this and
	they can be set with the <command>chmod</command>
	utility.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using Certificates, an Example</title>

      <para>So what can these files do?  A good use would be to
	encrypt connections to the <application>Sendmail</application>
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>.  This would dissolve the use of clear
	text authentication for users who send mail via the local
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>This is not the best use in the world as some
	  <acronym>MUA</acronym>s will present the user with an
	  error if they have not installed the certificate locally.
	  Refer to the documentation included with the software for
	  more information on certificate installation.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The following lines should be placed inside the
	local <filename>.mc</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>dnl SSL Options
define(`confCACERT_PATH',`/etc/certs')dnl
define(`confCACERT',`/etc/certs/new.crt')dnl
define(`confSERVER_CERT',`/etc/certs/new.crt')dnl
define(`confSERVER_KEY',`/etc/certs/myca.key')dnl
define(`confTLS_SRV_OPTIONS', `V')dnl</programlisting>

      <para>Where <filename class="directory">/etc/certs/</filename>
	is the directory to be used for storing the certificate
	and key files locally.  The last few requirements are a rebuild
	of the local <filename>.cf</filename> file.  This is easily
	achieved by typing <command>make
	<maketarget>install</maketarget></command> within the
	<filename class="directory">/etc/mail</filename>
	directory.  Follow that up with <command>make
	<maketarget>restart</maketarget></command> which should start the
	<application>Sendmail</application> daemon.</para>

      <para>If all went well there will be no error messages in the
	<filename>/var/log/maillog</filename> file and
	<application>Sendmail</application> will show up in the process
	list.</para>

      <para>For a simple test, simply connect to the mail server
	using the &man.telnet.1; utility:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>telnet <replaceable>example.com</replaceable> 25</userinput>

      <title>Configuring IPsec on &os;</title>

      <para>To begin, the
	<filename role="package">security/ipsec-tools</filename> must
	be installed from the Ports Collection.  This third party
	software package provides a number of applications which
	will help support the configuration.</para>

      <para>The next requirement is to create two &man.gif.4;
	pseudo-devices which will be used to tunnel packets and allow
	both networks to communicate properly.  As
	<username>root</username>, run the following commands,
	replacing the <replaceable>internal</replaceable> and
	<replaceable>external</replaceable> items with the
	real internal and external gateways:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 create</userinput></screen>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 <replaceable>internal1 internal2</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig gif0 tunnel <replaceable>external1 external2</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>For example, the corporate <acronym>LAN</acronym>'s public
	<acronym>IP</acronym> is
	<hostid role="ipaddr">172.16.5.4</hostid> having a private
	<acronym>IP</acronym> of
	<hostid role="ipaddr">10.246.38.1</hostid>.  The home
	<acronym>LAN</acronym>'s public <acronym>IP</acronym> is
	<hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.1.12</hostid> with an internal
	private <acronym>IP</acronym> of
	<hostid role="ipaddr">10.0.0.5</hostid>.</para>

      <para>This may seem confusing, so review the following example
	output from the &man.ifconfig.8; command:</para>

      <programlisting>Gateway 1:

gif0: flags=8051 mtu 1280
tunnel inet 172.16.5.4 --&gt; 192.168.1.12
inet6 fe80::2e0:81ff:fe02:5881%gif0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x6
inet 10.246.38.1 --&gt; 10.0.0.5 netmask 0xffffff00

Gateway 2:

gif0: flags=8051 mtu 1280
tunnel inet 192.168.1.12 --&gt; 172.16.5.4
inet 10.0.0.5 --&gt; 10.246.38.1 netmask 0xffffff00
inet6 fe80::250:bfff:fe3a:c1f%gif0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4</programlisting>

      <para>Once complete, both private <acronym>IP</acronym>s

      <para>As expected, both sides have the ability to send and
	receive <acronym>ICMP</acronym> packets from the privately
	configured addresses.  Next, both gateways must be told how
	to route packets in order to correctly send traffic from
	either network.  The following command will achieve this
	goal:</para>

      <para>At this point, both networks should be available and
	seem to be part of the same network.  Most likely both

	add the following lines to the firewall configuration
	file:</para>

      <programlisting>ipfw add 00201 allow log esp from any to any

      <note>
	<para>The rule numbers may need to be altered depending

      </note>

      <para>For users of &man.pf.4; or &man.ipf.8;, the following

      <para>Finally, to allow the machine to start support

	add the following lines to

    <para><application>OpenSSH</application> is a set of network connectivity tools used to
      access remote machines securely.  It can be used as a direct
      replacement for <command>rlogin</command>,
      <command>rsh</command>, <command>rcp</command>, and
      <command>telnet</command>.  Additionally, TCP/IP
      connections can be tunneled/forwarded securely through SSH.
      <application>OpenSSH</application> encrypts all traffic to effectively eliminate eavesdropping,
      connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks.</para>

    <para><application>OpenSSH</application> is maintained by the OpenBSD project, and is based
      upon SSH v1.2.12 with all the recent bug fixes and updates.  It
      is compatible with both SSH protocols 1 and 2.</para>

      <title>Advantages of Using OpenSSH</title>
  
      <para>Normally, when using &man.telnet.1; or &man.rlogin.1;,
        data is sent over the network in a clear, un-encrypted form.
        Network sniffers anywhere in between the client and server can
        steal your user/password information or data transferred in
        your session.  <application>OpenSSH</application> offers a variety of authentication and
        encryption methods to prevent this from happening.</para>

      <para>The login will continue just as it would have if a session was
        created using <command>rlogin</command> or
        <command>telnet</command>.  SSH utilizes a key fingerprint
        system for verifying the authenticity of the server when the 
        client connects.  The user is prompted to enter
	<literal>yes</literal> only when
        connecting for the first time.  Future attempts to login are all
        verified against the saved fingerprint key.  The SSH client
        will alert you if the saved fingerprint differs from the
        received fingerprint on future login attempts.  The fingerprints
        are saved in <filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts</filename>, or
	<filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts2</filename> for SSH v2
	fingerprints.</para>

      <para>By default, recent versions of the
        <application>OpenSSH</application> servers only accept SSH v2
        connections.  The client will use version 2 if possible and
        will fall back to version 1.  The client can also be forced to
        use one or the other by passing it the <option>-1</option> or
        <option>-2</option> for version 1 or version 2, respectively.
        The version 1 compatibility is maintained in the client for
        backwards compatibility with older versions.</para>

      <para>The &man.ssh-agent.1; and &man.ssh-add.1; utilities provide
        methods for <application>SSH</application> keys to be loaded
        into memory for use, without needing to type the passphrase
        each time.</para>

      <para>The &man.ssh-agent.1; utility will handle the authentication
        using the private key(s) that are loaded into it.
        &man.ssh-agent.1; should be used to launch another application.
        At the most basic level, it could spawn a shell or at a more
        advanced level, a window manager.</para>

      <para>To use &man.ssh-agent.1; in a shell, first it will need to
        be spawned with a shell as an argument.  Secondly, the
        identity needs to be added by running &man.ssh-add.1; and
        providing it the passphrase for the private key.  Once these
        steps have been completed the user will be able to &man.ssh.1;
        to any host that has the corresponding public key installed.
        For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; ssh-agent <replaceable>csh</replaceable>
&prompt.user; ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa:
Identity added: /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa (/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa)
&prompt.user;</screen>

      <para>To use &man.ssh-agent.1; in X11, a call to
        &man.ssh-agent.1; will need to be placed in
        <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>.  This will provide the
        &man.ssh-agent.1; services to all programs launched in X11.
        An example <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename> file might look
        like this:</para>

      <programlisting>exec ssh-agent <replaceable>startxfce4</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>This would launch &man.ssh-agent.1;, which would in turn
        launch <application>XFCE</application>, every time X11 starts.
        Then once that is done and X11 has been restarted so that the
        changes can take effect, simply run &man.ssh-add.1; to load
        all of your SSH keys.</para>

      <para>An SSH tunnel works by creating a listen socket on
	<hostid>localhost</hostid> on the specified port.
	It then forwards any connection received
	on the local host/port via the SSH connection to the specified
	remote host and port.</para>

      <para>In the example, port <replaceable>5023</replaceable> on
	<hostid>localhost</hostid> is being forwarded to port
	<replaceable>23</replaceable> on <hostid>localhost</hostid>
	of the remote machine.  Since <replaceable>23</replaceable> is <application>telnet</application>,
	this would create a secure <application>telnet</application> session through an SSH tunnel.</para>

      <para>This can be used to wrap any number of insecure TCP
        protocols such as SMTP, POP3, FTP, etc.</para>

        <para>This can be used in conjunction with an

	  <para>At work, there is an SSH server that accepts

	    resides a mail server running a POP3 server.  The network,
	    or network path between your home and office may or may not
	    be completely trustable.  Because of this, you need to check
	    your e-mail in a secure manner.  The solution is to create
	    an SSH connection to your office's SSH server, and tunnel
	    through to the mail server.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ssh -2 -N -f -L <replaceable>2110:mail.example.com:110 user@ssh-server.example.com</replaceable></userinput>
user@ssh-server.example.com's password: <userinput>******</userinput></screen>

	  <para>When the tunnel is up and running, you can point your

	  <title>Bypassing a Draconian Firewall</title>

	  <para>Some network administrators impose extremely draconian

	    and web surfing.</para>

	  <para>You may wish to access another (perhaps non-work
	    related) service, such as an Ogg Vorbis server to stream
	    music.  If this Ogg Vorbis server is streaming on some other
	    port than 22 or 80, you will not be able to access it.</para>

	  <para>The solution is to create an SSH connection to a machine

      <title>The <varname>AllowUsers</varname> Users Option</title>

      <para>It is often a good idea to limit which users can log in and
        from where.  The <literal>AllowUsers</literal> option is a good
        way to accomplish this.  For example, to only allow the
        <username>root</username> user to log in from
        <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.1.32</hostid>, something like this
        would be appropriate in the
        <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers root@192.168.1.32</programlisting>

      <para>To allow the user <username>admin</username> to log in from
        anywhere, just list the username by itself:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers admin</programlisting>

      <para>Multiple users should be listed on the same line, like so:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers root@192.168.1.32 admin</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>It is important that you list each user that needs to
          log in to this machine; otherwise they will be locked out.</para>
      </note>

      <para>After making changes to
         <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> you must tell
         &man.sshd.8; to reload its config files, by running:</para>

    <title>File System Access Control Lists</title>

    <para>In conjunction with file system enhancements like snapshots, FreeBSD
      offers the security of File System Access Control Lists
      (<acronym>ACL</acronym>s).</para>

    <para>Access Control Lists extend the standard &unix;
      permission model in a highly compatible (&posix;.1e) way.  This feature
      permits an administrator to make use of and take advantage of a
      more sophisticated security model.</para>

    <para>To enable <acronym>ACL</acronym> support for <acronym>UFS</acronym>
      file systems, the following:</para>

    <programlisting>options UFS_ACL</programlisting>

    <para>must be compiled into the kernel.  If this option has
      not been compiled in, a warning message will be displayed
      when attempting to mount a file system supporting <acronym>ACL</acronym>s.
      This option is included in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.
      <acronym>ACL</acronym>s rely on extended attributes being enabled on
      the file system.  Extended attributes are natively supported in the next generation
      &unix; file system, <acronym>UFS2</acronym>.</para>

    <note><para>A higher level of administrative overhead is required to
      configure extended attributes on <acronym>UFS1</acronym> than on
      <acronym>UFS2</acronym>.  The performance of extended attributes
      on <acronym>UFS2</acronym> is also substantially higher.  As a
      result, <acronym>UFS2</acronym> is generally recommended in preference
      to <acronym>UFS1</acronym> for use with access control lists.</para></note>

    <para><acronym>ACL</acronym>s are enabled by the mount-time administrative
      flag, <option>acls</option>, which may be added to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.
      The mount-time flag can also be automatically set in a persistent manner using
      &man.tunefs.8; to modify a superblock <acronym>ACL</acronym>s flag in the
      file system header.  In general, it is preferred to use the superblock flag
      for several reasons:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The mount-time <acronym>ACL</acronym>s flag cannot be changed by a
	remount (&man.mount.8; <option>-u</option>), only by means of a complete
	&man.umount.8; and fresh &man.mount.8;.  This means that
	<acronym>ACL</acronym>s cannot be enabled on the root file system after boot.
	It also means that you cannot change the disposition of a file system once
	it is in use.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Setting the superblock flag will cause the file system to always be
	mounted with <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled even if there is not an
	<filename>fstab</filename> entry or if the devices re-order.  This prevents
	accidental mounting of the file system without <acronym>ACL</acronym>s
	enabled, which can result in <acronym>ACL</acronym>s being improperly enforced,
	and hence security problems.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note><para>We may change the <acronym>ACL</acronym>s behavior to allow the flag to
      be enabled without a complete fresh &man.mount.8;, but we consider it desirable to
      discourage accidental mounting without <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled, because you
      can shoot your feet quite nastily if you enable <acronym>ACL</acronym>s, then disable
      them, then re-enable them without flushing the extended attributes.  In general, once
      you have enabled <acronym>ACL</acronym>s on a file system, they should not be disabled,
      as the resulting file protections may not be compatible with those intended by the
      users of the system, and re-enabling <acronym>ACL</acronym>s may re-attach the previous
      <acronym>ACL</acronym>s to files that have since had their permissions changed,
      resulting in other unpredictable behavior.</para></note>
      
    <para>File systems with <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled will show a <literal>+</literal>
      (plus) sign in their permission settings when viewed.  For example:</para>

    <programlisting>drwx------  2 robert  robert  512 Dec 27 11:54 private
drwxrwx---+ 2 robert  robert  512 Dec 23 10:57 directory1
drwxrwx---+ 2 robert  robert  512 Dec 22 10:20 directory2
drwxrwx---+ 2 robert  robert  512 Dec 27 11:57 directory3
drwxr-xr-x  2 robert  robert  512 Nov 10 11:54 public_html</programlisting>

    <para>Here we see that the <filename
      class="directory">directory1</filename>, <filename
      class="directory">directory2</filename>, and <filename
      class="directory">directory3</filename> directories are all taking 
      advantage of <acronym>ACL</acronym>s.  The <filename 
      class="directory">public_html</filename> directory is not.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Making Use of <acronym>ACL</acronym>s</title>

      <para>The file system <acronym>ACL</acronym>s can be viewed by the
	&man.getfacl.1; utility.  For instance, to view the
	<acronym>ACL</acronym> settings on the <filename>test</filename>
	file, one would use the command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>getfacl <filename>test</filename></userinput>
	#file:test
	#owner:1001
	#group:1001
	user::rw-
	group::r--
	other::r--</screen>

      <para>To change the <acronym>ACL</acronym> settings on this file,
	invoke the &man.setfacl.1; utility.  Observe:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>setfacl -k <filename>test</filename></userinput></screen>

      <para>The <option>-k</option> flag will remove all of the
	currently defined <acronym>ACL</acronym>s from a file or file
	system.  The more preferable method would be to use
	<option>-b</option> as it leaves the basic fields required for
	<acronym>ACL</acronym>s to work.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>setfacl -m u:trhodes:rwx,group:web:r--,o::--- <filename>test</filename></userinput></screen>

      <para>In the aforementioned command, the <option>-m</option>
	option was used to modify the default <acronym>ACL</acronym>
	entries.  Since there were no pre-defined entries, as they were
	removed by the previous command, this will restore the default
	options and assign the options listed.  Take care to notice that
	if you add a user or group which does not exist on the system,
	an <errorname>Invalid argument</errorname> error will be printed
	to <devicename>stdout</devicename>.</para>

    <title>Monitoring Third Party Security Issues</title>

    <para>In recent years, the security world has made many improvements
      to how vulnerability assessment is handled.  The threat of system
      intrusion increases as third party utilities are installed and
      configured for virtually any operating system available
      today.</para>

    <para>Vulnerability assessment is a key factor in security, and
      while &os; releases advisories for the base system, doing so
      for every third party utility is beyond the &os; Project's
      capability.  There is a way to mitigate third party
      vulnerabilities and warn administrators of known security
      issues.  A &os; add on utility known as
      <application>Portaudit</application> exists solely for this
      purpose.</para>

    <para>The <filename role="package">ports-mgmt/portaudit</filename> port
      polls a database, updated and maintained by the &os; Security
      Team and ports developers, for known security issues.</para>

    <para>To begin using <application>Portaudit</application>, one
      must install it from the Ports Collection:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portaudit &amp;&amp; make install clean</userinput></screen>

    <para>During the install process, the configuration files for
      &man.periodic.8; will be updated, permitting
      <application>Portaudit</application> output in the daily security
      runs.  Ensure the daily security run emails, which are sent to
      <username>root</username>'s email account, are being read.  No
      more configuration will be required here.</para>

    <para>After installation, an administrator can update the database
      and view known vulnerabilities in installed packages by invoking
      the following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portaudit -Fda</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>The database will automatically be updated during the
	&man.periodic.8; run; thus, the previous command is completely
	optional.  It is only required for the following
	examples.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To audit the third party utilities installed as part of
      the Ports Collection at anytime, an administrator need only run
      the following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portaudit -a</userinput></screen>

    <para><application>Portaudit</application> will produce something
      like this for vulnerable packages:</para>

    <programlisting>Affected package: cups-base-1.1.22.0_1
Type of problem: cups-base -- HPGL buffer overflow vulnerability.
Reference: &lt;http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/portaudit/40a3bca2-6809-11d9-a9e7-0001020eed82.html&gt;

1 problem(s) in your installed packages found.

You are advised to update or deinstall the affected package(s) immediately.</programlisting>

    <para>By pointing a web browser to the <acronym>URL</acronym> shown,
      an administrator may obtain more information about the
      vulnerability in question.  This will include versions affected,
      by &os; Port version, along with other web sites which may contain
      security advisories.</para>

    <para>In short, <application>Portaudit</application> is a powerful
      utility and extremely useful when coupled with the
      <application>Portupgrade</application> port.</para>

      <calloutlist>
	<callout arearefs="co-topic">
	  <para>The <literal>Topic</literal> field indicates exactly what the problem is.
	    It is basically an introduction to the current security
	    advisory and notes the utility with the
	    vulnerability.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-category">
	  <para>The <literal>Category</literal> refers to the affected part of the system
	    which may be one of <literal>core</literal>, <literal>contrib</literal>, or <literal>ports</literal>.  The <literal>core</literal>
	    category means that the vulnerability affects a core
	    component of the &os; operating system.  The <literal>contrib</literal>
	    category means that the vulnerability affects software
	    contributed to the &os; Project, such as
	    <application>sendmail</application>.  Finally the <literal>ports</literal>
	    category indicates that the vulnerability affects add on
	    software available as part of the Ports Collection.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-module">
	  <para>The <literal>Module</literal> field refers to the component location, for
	    instance <literal>sys</literal>.  In this example, we see that the module,
	    <literal>sys</literal>, is affected; therefore, this vulnerability
	    affects a component used within the kernel.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-announce">
	  <para>The <literal>Announced</literal> field reflects the date said security
	    advisory was published, or announced to the world.  This
	    means that the security team has verified that the problem
	    does exist and that a patch has been committed to the &os;
	    source code repository.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-credit">
	  <para>The <literal>Credits</literal> field gives credit to the individual or
	    organization who noticed the vulnerability and reported
	    it.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-affects">
	  <para>The <literal>Affects</literal> field explains which releases of &os; are
	    affected by this vulnerability.  For the kernel, a quick
	    look over the output from <command>ident</command> on the
	    affected files will help in determining the revision.
	    For ports, the version number is listed after the port name
	    in <filename class="directory">/var/db/pkg</filename>.  If the
	    system does not sync with the &os; <acronym>CVS</acronym>
	    repository and rebuild daily, chances are that it is
	    affected.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-corrected">
	  <para>The <literal>Corrected</literal> field indicates the date, time, time
	    offset, and release that was corrected.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-cve">
	  <para>Reserved for the identification information used to look up
	    vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities Database system.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-backround">
	  <para>The <literal>Background</literal> field gives information on exactly what
	    the affected utility is.  Most of the time this is why
	    the utility exists in &os;, what it is used for, and a bit
	    of information on how the utility came to be.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-descript">
	  <para>The <literal>Problem Description</literal> field explains the security hole
	    in depth.  This can include information on flawed code, or
	    even how the utility could be maliciously used to open
	    a security hole.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-impact">
	  <para>The <literal>Impact</literal> field describes what type of impact the
	    problem could have on a system.  For example, this could
	    be anything from a denial of service attack, to extra
	    privileges available to users, or even giving the attacker
	    superuser access.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-workaround">
	  <para>The <literal>Workaround</literal> field offers a feasible workaround to
	    system administrators who may be incapable of upgrading
	    the system.  This may be due to time constraints, network
	    availability, or a slew of other reasons.  Regardless,
	    security should not be taken lightly, and an affected system
	    should either be patched or the security hole workaround
	    should be implemented.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-solution">
	  <para>The <literal>Solution</literal> field offers instructions on patching the
	    affected system.  This is a step by step tested and verified
	    method for getting a system patched and working
	    securely.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-details">
	  <para>The <literal>Correction Details</literal> field displays the
	    <acronym>CVS</acronym> branch or release name with the

	    the revision number of the affected files within each
	    branch.</para>
	</callout>

	<callout arearefs="co-ref">
	  <para>The <literal>References</literal> field usually offers sources of other

    <title>Process Accounting</title>

    <para>Process accounting is a security method in which an
      administrator may keep track of system resources used,
      their allocation among users, provide for system monitoring,
      and minimally track a user's commands.</para>

    <para>This indeed has its own positive and negative points.  One of
      the positives is that an intrusion may be narrowed down
      to the point of entry.  A negative is the amount of logs
      generated by process accounting, and the disk space they may
      require.  This section will walk an administrator through
      the basics of process accounting.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enable and Utilizing Process Accounting</title>
      <para>Before making use of process accounting, it
	must be enabled.  To do this, execute the following
	commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch <filename>/var/account/acct</filename></userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>accton <filename>/var/account/acct</filename></userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'accounting_enable="YES"' &gt;&gt; <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename></userinput></screen>

      <para>Once enabled, accounting will begin to track
	<acronym>CPU</acronym> stats, commands, etc.  All accounting
	logs are in a non-human readable format and may be viewed
	using the &man.sa.8; utility.  If issued without any options,
	<command>sa</command> will print information relating to the
	number of per user calls, the total elapsed time in minutes,
	total <acronym>CPU</acronym> and user time in minutes, average
	number of I/O operations, etc.</para>

      <para>To view information about commands being issued, one
	would use the &man.lastcomm.1; utility.  The
	<command>lastcomm</command> command may be used to print out commands
	issued by users on specific &man.ttys.5;, for example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>lastcomm ls
	<username>trhodes</username> ttyp1</userinput></screen>

      <para>Would print out all known usage of the <command>ls</command>
        by <username>trhodes</username> on the <literal>ttyp1</literal> terminal.</para>

      <para>Many other useful options exist and are explained in the
	&man.lastcomm.1;, &man.acct.5; and &man.sa.8; manual
	pages.</para>

    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>Security, whether physical or virtual, is a topic so broad
      that an entire industry has evolved around it.  Hundreds of
      standard practices have been authored about how to secure
      systems and networks, and as a user of &os;, understanding how
      to protect against attacks and intruders is a must.</para>

    <para>In this chapter, several fundamentals and techniques will be
      discussed.  The &os; system comes with multiple layers of
      security, and many more third party utilities may be added to
      enhance security.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="security-intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Security is everyone's responsibility.  A weak entry point
      in any system could allow intruders to gain access to critical
      information and cause havoc on an entire network.  One of the
      core principles of information security is the
      <acronym>CIA</acronym> triad, which stands for the
      Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information
      systems.</para>

    <para>The <acronym>CIA</acronym> triad is a bedrock concept of
      computer security as customers and users expect their data to be
      protected.  For example, a customer expects that their credit
      card information is securely stored (confidentiality), that
      their orders are not changed behind the scenes (integrity), and
      that they have access to their order information at all times
      (availablility).</para>

    <para>To provide <acronym>CIA</acronym>, security professionals
      apply a defense in depth strategy.  The idea of defense in depth
      is to add several layers of security to prevent one single layer
      failing and the entire security system collapsing.  For example,
      a system administrator cannot simply turn on a firewall and
      consider the network or system secure.  One must also audit
      accounts, check the integrity of binaries, and ensure malicious
      tools are not installed.  To implement an effective security
      strategy, one must understand threats and how to defend against
      them.</para>

    <para>What is a threat as it pertains to computer security?
      Threats are not limited to remote attackers who attempt to
      access a system without permission from a remote location.
      Threats also include employees, malicious software, unauthorized
      network devices, natural disasters, security vulnerabilities,
      and even competing corporations.</para>

    <para>Systems and networks can be accessed without permission,
      sometimes by accident, or by remote attackers, and in some
      cases, via corporate espionage or former employees.  As a user,
      it is important to prepare for and admit when a mistake has led
      to a security breach and report possible issues to the security
      team.  As an administrator, it is important to know of the
      threats and be prepared to mitigate them.</para>

    <para>When applying security to systems, it is recommended to
      start by securing the basic accounts and system configuration,
      and then to secure the network layer so that it adheres to the
      system policy and the organization's security procedures.  Many
      organizations already have a security policy that covers the
      configuration of technology devices.  The policy should include
      the security configuration of workstations, desktops, mobile
      devices, phones, production servers, and development servers.
      In many cases, standard operating procedures
      (<acronym>SOP</acronym>s) already exist.  When in doubt, ask the
      security team.</para>

    <para>The rest of this introduction describes how some of these
      basic security configurations are performed on a &os; system.
      The rest of this chapter describes some specific tools which can
      be used when implementing a security policy on a &os;
      system.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-accounts">
      <title>Preventing Logins</title>

      <para>In securing a system, a good starting point is an audit of
	accounts.  Ensure that <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem> has a strong password and
	that this password is not shared.  Disable any accounts that
	do not need login access.</para>

      <para>To deny login access to accounts, two methods exist.  The
	first is to lock the account.  This example locks the
	<systemitem class="username">toor</systemitem> account:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw lock <replaceable>toor</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The second method is to prevent login access by changing
	the shell to <filename>/usr/sbin/nologin</filename>.  Only the
	superuser can change the shell for other users:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin <replaceable>toor</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The <filename>/usr/sbin/nologin</filename> shell prevents
	the system from assigning a shell to the user when they
	attempt to login.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-accountmgmt">
      <title>Permitted Account Escalation</title>

      <para>In some cases, system administration needs to be shared
	with other users.  &os; has two methods to handle this.  The
	first one, which is not recommended, is a shared root password
	used by members of the <systemitem
	  class="groupname">wheel</systemitem> group.  With this
	method, a user types <command>su</command> and enters the
	password for <systemitem class="groupname">wheel</systemitem>
	whenever superuser access is needed.  The user should then
	type <command>exit</command> to leave privileged access after
	finishing the commands that required administrative access.
	To add a user to this group, edit
	<filename>/etc/group</filename> and add the user to the end of
	the <literal>wheel</literal> entry.  The user must be
	separated by a comma character with no space.</para>

      <para>The second, and recommended, method to permit privilege
	escalation is to install the <package>security/sudo</package>
	package or port.  This software provides additional auditing,
	more fine-grained user control, and can be configured to lock
	users into running only the specified privileged
	commands.</para>

      <para>After installation, use <command>visudo</command> to edit
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/sudoers</filename>.  This example
	creates a new <systemitem
	  class="groupname">webadmin</systemitem> group, adds the
	<systemitem class="username">trhodes</systemitem> account to
	that group, and configures that group access to restart
	<package>apache24</package>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupadd webadmin -M trhodes -g 6000</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>visudo</userinput>
%webadmin ALL=(ALL) /usr/sbin/service apache24 *</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-passwords">
      <title>Password Hashes</title>

      <para>Passwords are a necessary evil of technology.  When they
	must be used, they should be complex and a powerful hash
	mechanism should be used to encrypt the version that is stored
	in the password database.  &os; supports the
	<acronym>DES</acronym>, <acronym>MD5</acronym>,
	<acronym>SHA256</acronym>, <acronym>SHA512</acronym>, and
	Blowfish hash algorithms in its <function>crypt()</function>
	library.  The default of <acronym>SHA512</acronym> should not
	be changed to a less secure hashing algorithm, but can be
	changed to the more secure Blowfish algorithm.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Blowfish is not part of <acronym>AES</acronym> and is
	  not considered compliant with any Federal Information
	  Processing Standards (<acronym>FIPS</acronym>).  Its use may
	  not be permitted in some environments.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To determine which hash algorithm is used to encrypt a
	user's password, the superuser can view the hash for the user
	in the &os; password database.  Each hash starts with a symbol
	which indicates the type of hash mechanism used to encrypt the
	password.  If <acronym>DES</acronym> is used, there is no
	beginning symbol.  For <acronym>MD5</acronym>, the symbol is
	<literal>$</literal>.  For <acronym>SHA256</acronym> and
	<acronym>SHA512</acronym>, the symbol is
	<literal>$6$</literal>.  For Blowfish, the symbol is
	<literal>$2a$</literal>.  In this example, the password for
	<systemitem class="username">dru</systemitem> is hashed using
	the default <acronym>SHA512</acronym> algorithm as the hash
	starts with <literal>$6$</literal>.  Note that the encrypted
	hash, not the password itself, is stored in the password
	database:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>grep dru /etc/master.passwd</userinput>
dru:$6$pzIjSvCAn.PBYQBA$PXpSeWPx3g5kscj3IMiM7tUEUSPmGexxta.8Lt9TGSi2lNQqYGKszsBPuGME0:1001:1001::0:0:dru:/usr/home/dru:/bin/csh</screen>

      <para>The hash mechanism is set in the user's login class.  For
	this example, the user is in the <literal>default</literal>
	login class and the hash algorithm is set with this line in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>        :passwd_format=sha512:\</programlisting>

      <para>To change the algorithm to Blowfish, modify that line to
	look like this:</para>

      <programlisting>        :passwd_format=blf:\</programlisting>

      <para>Then run <command>cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</command> as
	described in <xref linkend="users-limiting"/>.  Note that this
	change will not affect any existing password hashes.  This
	means that all passwords should be re-hashed by asking users
	to run <command>passwd</command> in order to change their
	password.</para>

      <para>For remote logins, two-factor authentication should be
	used.  An example of two-factor authentication is
	<quote>something you have</quote>, such as a key, and
	<quote>something you know</quote>, such as the passphrase for
	that key.  Since <application>OpenSSH</application> is part of
	the &os; base system, all network logins should be over an
	encrypted connection and use key-based authentication instead
	of passwords.  For more information, refer to <xref
	  linkend="openssh"/>.  Kerberos users may need to make
	additional changes to implement
	<application>OpenSSH</application> in their network.  These
	changes are described in <xref linkend="kerberos5"/>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-pwpolicy">
      <title>Password Policy Enforcement</title>

      <para>Enforcing a strong password policy for local accounts is a
	fundamental aspect of system security.  In &os;, password
	length, password strength, and password complexity can be
	implemented using built-in Pluggable Authentication Modules
	(<acronym>PAM</acronym>).</para>

      <para>This section demonstrates how to configure the minimum and
	maximum password length and the enforcement of mixed
	characters using the <filename>pam_passwdqc.so</filename>
	module.  This module is enforced when a user changes their
	password.</para>

      <para>To configure this module, become the superuser and
	uncomment the line containing
	<literal>pam_passwdqc.so</literal> in
	<filename>/etc/pam.d/passwd</filename>.  Then, edit that line
	to match the password policy:</para>

      <programlisting>password        requisite       pam_passwdqc.so         <replaceable>min=disabled,disabled,disabled,12,10 similar=deny retry=3</replaceable> enforce=users</programlisting>

      <para>This example sets several requirements for new passwords.
	The <literal>min</literal> setting controls the minimum
	password length.  It has five values because this module
	defines five different types of passwords based on their
	complexity.  Complexity is defined by the type of characters
	that must exist in a password, such as letters, numbers,
	symbols, and case.  The types of passwords are described in
	&man.pam.passwdqc.8;.  In this example, the first three types
	of passwords are disabled, meaning that passwords that meet
	those complexity requirements will not be accepted, regardless
	of their length.    The <literal>12</literal> sets a minimum
	password policy of at least twelve characters, if the password
	also contains characters with three types of complexity.  The
	<literal>10</literal> sets the password policy to also allow
	passwords of at least ten characters, if the password contains
	characters with four types of complexity.</para>

      <para>The <literal>similar</literal> setting denies passwords
	that are similar to the user's previous password.  The
	<literal>retry</literal> setting provides a user with three
	opportunities to enter a new password.</para>

      <para>Once this file is saved, a user changing their password
	will see a message similar to the following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>passwd</userinput>
Changing local password for trhodes
Old Password:

You can now choose the new password.
A valid password should be a mix of upper and lower case letters,
digits and other characters.  You can use a 12 character long
password with characters from at least 3 of these 4 classes, or
a 10 character long password containing characters from all the
classes.  Characters that form a common pattern are discarded by
the check.
Alternatively, if no one else can see your terminal now, you can
pick this as your password: "trait-useful&amp;knob".
Enter new password:</screen>

      <para>If a password that does not match the policy is entered,
	it will be rejected with a warning and the user will have an
	opportunity to try again, up to the configured number of
	retries.</para>

      <para>Most password policies require passwords to expire after
	so many days.  To set a password age time in &os;, set
	<option>passwordtime</option> for the user's login class in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.  The
	<literal>default</literal> login class contains an
	example:</para>

      <programlisting>#       :passwordtime=90d:\</programlisting>

      <para>So, to set an expiry of 90 days for this login class,
	remove the comment symbol (<literal>#</literal>), save the
	edit, and run <command>cap_mkdb
	  /etc/login.conf</command>.</para>

      <para>To set the expiration on individual users, pass an
	expiration date or the number of days to expiry and a username
	to <command>pw</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw usermod -p <replaceable>30-apr-2015</replaceable> -n <replaceable>trhodes</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>As seen here, an expiration date is set in the form of
	day, month, and year.  For more information, see
	&man.pw.8;.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-rkhunter">
      <title>Detecting Rootkits</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>rootkit</firstterm> is any unauthorized
	software that attempts to gain <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem> access to a system.  Once
	installed, this malicious software will normally open up
	another avenue of entry for an attacker.  Realistically, once
	a system has been compromised by a rootkit and an
	investigation has been performed, the system should be
	reinstalled from scratch.  There is tremendous risk that even
	the most prudent security or systems engineer will miss
	something an attacker left behind.</para>

      <para>A rootkit does do one thing useful for administrators:
	once detected, it is a sign that a compromise happened at some
	point.  But, these types of applications tend to be very well
	hidden.  This section demonstrates a tool that can be used to
	detect rootkits, <package>security/rkhunter</package>.</para>

      <para>After installation of this package or port, the system may
	be checked using the following command.  It will produce a lot
	of information and will require some manual pressing of
	<keycap>ENTER</keycap>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rkhunter -c</userinput></screen>

      <para>After the process completes, a status message will be
	printed to the screen.  This message will include the amount
	of files checked, suspect files, possible rootkits, and more.
	During the check, some generic security warnings may
	be produced about hidden files, the
	<application>OpenSSH</application> protocol selection, and
	known vulnerable versions of installed software.  These can be
	handled now or after a more detailed analysis has been
	performed.</para>

      <para>Every administrator should know what is running on the
	systems they are responsible for.  Third-party tools like
	<application>rkhunter</application> and
	<package>sysutils/lsof</package>, and native commands such
	as <command>netstat</command> and <command>ps</command>, can
	show a great deal of information on the system.  Take notes on
	what is normal, ask questions when something seems out of
	place, and be paranoid.  While preventing a compromise is
	ideal, detecting a compromise is a must.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-ids">
      <title>Binary Verification</title>

      <para>Verification of system files and binaries is important
	because it provides the system administration and security
	teams information about system changes.  A software
	application that monitors the system for changes is called an
	Intrusion Detection System (<acronym>IDS</acronym>).</para>

      <para>&os; provides native support for a basic
	<acronym>IDS</acronym> system.  While the nightly security
	emails will notify an administrator of changes, the
	information is stored locally and there is a chance that a
	malicious user could modify this information in order to hide
	their changes to the system.  As such, it is recommended to
	create a separate set of binary signatures and store them on a
	read-only, root-owned directory or, preferably, on a removable
	<acronym>USB</acronym> disk or remote
	<application>rsync</application> server.</para>

      <para>The built-in <command>mtree</command> utility can be used
	to generate a specification of the contents of a directory.  A
	seed, or a numeric constant, is used to generate the
	specification and is required to check that the specification
	has not changed.  This makes it possible to determine if a
	file or binary has been modified.  Since the seed value is
	unknown by an attacker, faking or checking the checksum values
	of files will be difficult to impossible.  The following
	example generates a set of <acronym>SHA256</acronym> hashes,
	one for each system binary in <filename>/bin</filename>, and
	saves those values to a hidden file in <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem>'s home directory,
	<filename>/root/.bin_chksum_mtree</filename>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mtree -s <replaceable>3483151339707503</replaceable> -c -K cksum,sha256digest -p <replaceable>/bin</replaceable> &gt; <replaceable>/root/.bin_chksum_mtree</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; mtree: /bin checksum: 3427012225</screen>

      <para>The <replaceable>3483151339707503</replaceable> represents
	the seed.  This value should be remembered, but not
	shared.</para>

      <para>Viewing <filename>/root/.bin_cksum_mtree</filename> should

      <title>System Tuning for Security</title>

      <para>In &os;, many system features can be tuned using

	which can be tuned to prevent Denial of Service
	(<acronym>DoS</acronym>) attacks will be covered in this

      <note>
	<para>Any time a setting is changed with
	  <command>sysctl</command>, the chance to cause undesired

	  All changes should be monitored and, if possible, tried on a

	  system.</para>
      </note>

      <para>By default, the &os; kernel boots with a security level of
	<literal>-1</literal>.  This is called <quote>insecure
	  mode</quote> because immutable file flags may be turned off
	and all devices may be read from or written to.  The security
	level will remain at <literal>-1</literal> unless it is
	altered through <command>sysctl</command> or by a setting in
	the startup scripts.  The security level may be increased
	during system startup by setting
	<varname>kern_securelevel_enable</varname> to
	<literal>YES</literal> in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
	and the value of <varname>kern_securelevel</varname> to the

    <indexterm><primary>one-time passwords</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>security</primary>
      <secondary>one-time passwords</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>By default, &os; includes support for One-time Passwords In
      Everything (<acronym>OPIE</acronym>).  <acronym>OPIE</acronym>
      is designed to prevent replay attacks, in which an attacker
      discovers a user's password and uses it to access a system.
      Since a password is only used once in <acronym>OPIE</acronym>, a
      discovered password is of little use to an attacker.
      <acronym>OPIE</acronym> uses a secure hash and a
      challenge/response system to manage passwords.  The &os;
      implementation uses the <acronym>MD5</acronym> hash by
      default.</para>

    <para><acronym>OPIE</acronym> uses three different types of
      passwords.  The first is the usual &unix; or Kerberos password.
      The second is the one-time password which is generated by
      <command>opiekey</command>.  The third type of password is the
      <quote>secret password</quote> which is used to generate
      one-time passwords.  The secret password has nothing to do with,
      and should be different from, the &unix; password.</para>

    <para>There are two other pieces of data that are important to
      <acronym>OPIE</acronym>.  One is the <quote>seed</quote> or
      <quote>key</quote>, consisting of two letters and five digits.
      The other is the <quote>iteration count</quote>, a number
      between 1 and 100.  <acronym>OPIE</acronym> creates the one-time
      password by concatenating the seed and the secret password,
      applying the <acronym>MD5</acronym> hash as many times as
      specified by the iteration count, and turning the result into
      six short English words which represent the one-time password.
      The authentication system keeps track of the last one-time
      password used, and the user is authenticated if the hash of the
      user-provided password is equal to the previous password.
      Since a one-way hash is used, it is impossible to generate
      future one-time passwords if a successfully used password is
      captured.  The iteration count is decremented after each
      successful login to keep the user and the login program in sync.
      When the iteration count gets down to <literal>1</literal>,
      <acronym>OPIE</acronym> must be reinitialized.</para>

    <para>There are a few programs involved in this process.  A
      one-time password, or a consecutive list of one-time passwords,
      is generated by passing an iteration count, a seed, and a secret
      password to &man.opiekey.1;.  In addition to initializing
      <acronym>OPIE</acronym>, &man.opiepasswd.1; is used to change
      passwords, iteration counts, or seeds.  The relevant credential
      files in <filename>/etc/opiekeys</filename> are examined by
      &man.opieinfo.1; which prints out the invoking user's current
      iteration count and seed.</para>

    <para>This section describes four different sorts of operations.
      The first is how to set up one-time-passwords for the first time
      over a secure connection.  The second is how to use
      <command>opiepasswd</command> over an insecure connection.  The
      third is how to log in over an insecure connection.  The fourth
      is how to generate a number of keys which can be written down or
      printed out to use at insecure locations.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Initializing <acronym>OPIE</acronym></title>

      <para>To initialize <acronym>OPIE</acronym> for the first time,
	run this command from a secure location:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>opiepasswd -c</userinput>
Adding unfurl:
Only use this method from the console; NEVER from remote. If you are using
telnet, xterm, or a dial-in, type ^C now or exit with no password.
Then run opiepasswd without the -c parameter.
Using MD5 to compute responses.
Enter new secret pass phrase:
Again new secret pass phrase:

      <para>The <option>-c</option> sets console mode which assumes
	that the command is being run from a secure location, such as
	a computer under the user's control or an
	<acronym>SSH</acronym> session to a computer under the user's
	control.</para>

      <para>When prompted, enter the secret password which will be
	used to generate the one-time login keys.  This password
	should be difficult to guess and should be different than the
	password which is associated with the user's login account.
	It must be between 10 and 127 characters long.  Remember this
	password.</para>

      <para>The <literal>ID</literal> line lists the login name
	(<literal>unfurl</literal>), default iteration count
	(<literal>499</literal>), and default seed
	(<literal>to4268</literal>).  When logging in, the system will
	remember these parameters and display them, meaning that they
	do not have to be memorized.  The last line lists the
	generated one-time password which corresponds to those
	parameters and the secret password.  At the next login, use
	this one-time password.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Insecure Connection Initialization</title>

      <para>To initialize or change the secret password on an
	insecure system, a secure connection is needed to some place
	where <command>opiekey</command> can be run.  This might be a
	shell prompt on a trusted machine.  An iteration count is
	needed, where 100 is probably a good value, and the seed can
	either be specified or the randomly-generated one used.  On
	the insecure connection, the machine being initialized, use
	&man.opiepasswd.1;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>opiepasswd</userinput>

Updating unfurl:
You need the response from an OTP generator.
Old secret pass phrase:

    <sect2>
      <title>Generating a Single One-time Password</title>

      <para>After initializing <acronym>OPIE</acronym> and logging in,
	a prompt like this will be displayed:</para>

login: <userinput>&lt;username&gt;</userinput>
otp-md5 498 gr4269 ext
Password: </screen>

      <para>The <acronym>OPIE</acronym> prompts provides a useful
	feature.  If <keycap>Return</keycap> is pressed at the
	password prompt, the prompt will turn echo on and display
	what is typed.  This can be useful when attempting to type in
	a password by hand from a printout.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>MS-DOS</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Windows</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>MacOS</primary></indexterm>

      <para>At this point, generate the one-time password to answer
	this login prompt.  This must be done on a trusted system
	where it is safe to run &man.opiekey.1;.  There are versions
	of this command for &windows;, &macos; and &os;.  This command
	needs the iteration count and the seed as command line
	options.  Use cut-and-paste from the login prompt on the
	machine being logged in to.</para>

      <title>Generating Multiple One-time Passwords</title>

      <para>Sometimes there is no access to a trusted machine or

      <title>Restricting Use of &unix; Passwords</title>

      <para><acronym>OPIE</acronym> can restrict the use of &unix;
	passwords based on the IP address of a login session.  The
	relevant file is <filename>/etc/opieaccess</filename>, which
	is present by default.  Refer to &man.opieaccess.5; for more

      <programlisting>permit 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0</programlisting>

      <para>This line allows users whose IP source address (which is

    <indexterm><primary>TCP Wrapper</primary></indexterm>

    <para><application>TCP Wrapper</application> is a host-based
      access control system which extends the abilities of <xref
	linkend="network-inetd"/>.  It can be configured to provide
      logging support, return messages, and connection restrictions
      for the server daemons under the control of
      <application>inetd</application>.  Refer to &man.tcpd.8; for
      more information about
      <application>TCP Wrapper</application> and its features.</para>

    <para><application>TCP Wrapper</application> should not be
      considered a replacement for a properly configured firewall.
      Instead, <application>TCP Wrapper</application> should be used
      in conjunction with a firewall and other security enhancements
      in order to provide another layer of protection in the
      implementation of a security policy.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Initial Configuration</title>

      <para>To enable <application>TCP Wrapper</application> in &os;,
	add the following lines to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>inetd_enable="YES"
inetd_flags="-Ww"</programlisting>

      <para>Then, properly configure
	<filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Unlike other implementations of
	  <application>TCP Wrapper</application>, the use of
	  <filename>hosts.deny</filename> is deprecated in &os;.  All
	  configuration options should be placed in
	  <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>In the simplest configuration, daemon connection policies
	are set to either permit or block, depending on the options in
	<filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.  The default
	configuration in &os; is to allow all connections to the
	daemons started with <application>inetd</application>.</para>

      <para>Basic configuration usually takes the form of
	<literal>daemon : address : action</literal>, where
	<literal>daemon</literal> is the daemon which
	<application>inetd</application> started,
	<literal>address</literal> is a valid hostname,
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address, or an IPv6 address enclosed in
	brackets ([&nbsp;]), and <literal>action</literal> is either
	<literal>allow</literal> or <literal>deny</literal>.
	<application>TCP Wrapper</application> uses a first rule match
	semantic, meaning that the configuration file is scanned from
	the beginning for a matching rule.  When a match is found, the
	rule is applied and the search process stops.</para>

      <para>For example, to allow <acronym>POP</acronym>3 connections
	via the <package>mail/qpopper</package> daemon, the following
	lines should be appended to
	<filename>hosts.allow</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting># This line is required for POP3 connections:
qpopper : ALL : allow</programlisting>

      <para>Whenever this file is edited, restart
	<application>inetd</application>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service inetd restart</userinput></screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Advanced Configuration</title>

      <para><application>TCP Wrapper</application> provides advanced
	options to allow more control over the way connections are
	handled.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to return a
	comment to certain hosts or daemon connections.  In other
	cases, a log entry should be recorded or an email sent to the
	administrator.  Other situations may require the use of a
	service for local connections only.  This is all possible
	through the use of configuration options known as wildcards,
	expansion characters, and external command execution.</para>

      <para>Suppose that a situation occurs where a connection should
	be denied yet a reason should be sent to the host who
	attempted to establish that connection.  That action is
	possible with <option>twist</option>.  When a connection
	attempt is made, <option>twist</option> executes a shell
	command or script.  An example exists in
	<filename>hosts.allow</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting># The rest of the daemons are protected.
ALL : ALL \
	: severity auth.info \
	: twist /bin/echo "You are not welcome to use %d from %h."</programlisting>

      <para>In this example, the message <quote>You are not allowed to
	  use <replaceable>daemon name</replaceable> from
	  <replaceable>hostname</replaceable>.</quote> will be
	returned for any daemon not configured in
	<filename>hosts.allow</filename>.  This is useful for sending
	a reply back to the connection initiator right after the
	established connection is dropped.  Any message returned
	<emphasis>must</emphasis> be wrapped in quote
	(<literal>"</literal>) characters.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>It may be possible to launch a denial of service attack
	  on the server if an attacker floods these daemons with
	  connection requests.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Another possibility is to use <option>spawn</option>.
	Like <option>twist</option>, <option>spawn</option> implicitly
	denies the connection and may be used to run external shell
	commands or scripts.  Unlike <option>twist</option>,
	<option>spawn</option> will not send a reply back to the host
	who established the connection.  For example, consider the
	following configuration:</para>

      <programlisting># We do not allow connections from example.com:
ALL : .example.com \
	: spawn (/bin/echo %a from %h attempted to access %d &gt;&gt; \
	  /var/log/connections.log) \
	: deny</programlisting>

      <para>This will deny all connection attempts from <systemitem
	  class="fqdomainname">*.example.com</systemitem> and log the
	hostname, <acronym>IP</acronym> address, and the daemon to
	which access was attempted to
	<filename>/var/log/connections.log</filename>.  This example
	uses the substitution characters <literal>%a</literal> and
	<literal>%h</literal>.  Refer to &man.hosts.access.5; for the
	complete list.</para>

      <para>To match every instance of a daemon, domain, or
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address, use <literal>ALL</literal>.
	Another wildcard is <literal>PARANOID</literal> which may be
	used to match any host which provides an <acronym>IP</acronym>
	address that may be forged because the <acronym>IP</acronym>
	address differs from its resolved hostname.  In this example,
	all connection requests to <application>Sendmail</application>
	which have an <acronym>IP</acronym> address that varies from
	its hostname will be denied:</para>

      <programlisting># Block possibly spoofed requests to sendmail:
sendmail : PARANOID : deny</programlisting>

      <caution>
	<para>Using the <literal>PARANOID</literal> wildcard will
	  result in denied connections if the client or server has a
	  broken <acronym>DNS</acronym> setup.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>To learn more about wildcards and their associated
	functionality, refer to &man.hosts.access.5;.</para>

      <note>
	<para>When adding new configuration lines, make sure that any
	  unneeded entries for that daemon are commented out in
	  <filename>hosts.allow</filename>.</para>

    <para><application>Kerberos</application> is a network
      authentication protocol which was originally created by the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<acronym>MIT</acronym>)
      as a way to securely provide authentication across a potentially
      hostile network.  The <application>Kerberos</application>
      protocol uses strong cryptography so that both a client and
      server can prove their identity without sending any unencrypted
      secrets over the network.  <application>Kerberos</application>
      can be described as an identity-verifying proxy system and as a
      trusted third-party authentication system.  After a user
      authenticates with <application>Kerberos</application>, their
      communications can be encrypted to assure privacy and data
      integrity.</para>

    <para>The only function of <application>Kerberos</application> is
      to provide the secure authentication of users and servers on the
      network.  It does not provide authorization or auditing
      functions.  It is recommended that
      <application>Kerberos</application> be used with other security
      methods which provide authorization and audit services.</para>

    <para>The current version of the protocol is version 5, described
      in <acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;4120.  Several free
      implementations of this protocol are available, covering a wide
      range of operating systems.  <acronym>MIT</acronym> continues to
      develop their <application>Kerberos</application> package.  It
      is commonly used in the <acronym>US</acronym> as a cryptography
      product, and has historically been subject to
      <acronym>US</acronym> export regulations.  In &os;,
      <acronym>MIT</acronym> <application>Kerberos</application> is
      available as the <package>security/krb5</package> package or
      port.  The Heimdal <application>Kerberos</application>
      implementation was explicitly developed outside of the
      <acronym>US</acronym> to avoid export regulations.  The Heimdal
      <application>Kerberos</application> distribution is included in
      the base &os; installation, and another distribution with more
      configurable options is available as
      <package>security/heimdal</package> in the Ports
      Collection.</para>

    <para>In <application>Kerberos</application> users and services
      are identified as <quote>principals</quote> which are contained
      within an administrative grouping, called a
      <quote>realm</quote>.  A typical user principal would be of the
      form
      <literal><replaceable>user</replaceable>@<replaceable>REALM</replaceable></literal>
      (realms are traditionally uppercase).</para>

    <para>This section provides a guide on how to set up
      <application>Kerberos</application> using the Heimdal
      distribution included in &os;.</para>

    <para>For purposes of demonstrating a

      <title>Setting up a Heimdal <acronym>KDC</acronym></title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>Kerberos5</primary>
	<secondary>Key Distribution Center</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The Key Distribution Center (<acronym>KDC</acronym>) is
	the centralized authentication service that
	<application>Kerberos</application> provides, the
	<quote>trusted third party</quote> of the system.  It is the
	computer that issues <application>Kerberos</application>
	tickets, which are used for clients to authenticate to
	servers.  As the <acronym>KDC</acronym> is considered
	trusted by all other computers in the
	<application>Kerberos</application> realm, it has heightened
	security concerns.  Direct access to the KDC should be
	limited.</para>

      <para>While running a <acronym>KDC</acronym> requires few
	computing resources, a dedicated machine acting only as a
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> is recommended for security
	reasons.</para>

      <para>To begin, install the <package>security/heimdal</package>
	package as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install heimdal</userinput></screen>

      <para>Next, update <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> using
	<command>sysrc</command> as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysrc kdc_enable=yes</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysrc kadmind_enable=yes</userinput></screen>

      <para>Next, edit <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> as
	follows:</para>

      <programlisting>[libdefaults]
    default_realm = <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable>
[realms]
    <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable> = {
	kdc = <replaceable>kerberos.example.org</replaceable>
	admin_server = <replaceable>kerberos.example.org</replaceable>
    }
[domain_realm]
    <replaceable>.example.org</replaceable> = <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>In this example, the <acronym>KDC</acronym> will use the
	fully-qualified hostname <systemitem
	  class="fqdomainname">kerberos.example.org</systemitem>.  The
	hostname of the KDC must be resolvable in the
	<acronym>DNS</acronym>.</para>

      <para><application>Kerberos</application> can also use the
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> to locate KDCs, instead of a
	<literal>[realms]</literal> section in
	<filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>.  For large organizations
	that have their own <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers, the above
	example could be trimmed to:</para>

      <programlisting>[libdefaults]
      default_realm = <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable>
[domain_realm]
    <replaceable>.example.org</replaceable> = <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>With the following lines being included in the
	<systemitem class="fqdomainname">example.org</systemitem> zone
	file:</para>

      <programlisting>_kerberos._udp      IN  SRV     01 00 88 <replaceable>kerberos.example.org</replaceable>.
_kerberos._tcp      IN  SRV     01 00 88 <replaceable>kerberos.example.org</replaceable>.
_kpasswd._udp       IN  SRV     01 00 464 <replaceable>kerberos.example.org</replaceable>.

_kerberos           IN  TXT     <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable></programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>In order for clients to be able to find the
	  <application>Kerberos</application> services, they
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> have either
	  a fully configured <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> or a
	  minimally configured <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>
	  <emphasis>and</emphasis> a properly configured
	  <acronym>DNS</acronym> server.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Next, create the <application>Kerberos</application>
	database which contains the keys of all principals (users and
	hosts) encrypted with a master password.  It is not required
	to remember this password as it will be stored in
	<filename>/var/heimdal/m-key</filename>; it would be
	reasonable to use a 45-character random password for this
	purpose.  To create the master key, run
	<command>kstash</command> and enter a password:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kstash</userinput>
Master key: <userinput><replaceable>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</replaceable></userinput>
Verifying password - Master key: <userinput><replaceable>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Once the master key has been created, the database should
	be initialized.  The <application>Kerberos</application>
	administrative tool &man.kadmin.8; can be used on the KDC in a
	mode that operates directly on the database, without using the
	&man.kadmind.8; network service, as
	<command>kadmin -l</command>.  This resolves the
	chicken-and-egg problem of trying to connect to the database
	before it is created.  At the <command>kadmin</command>
	prompt, use <command>init</command> to create the realm's
	initial database:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kadmin -l</userinput>
kadmin&gt; <userinput>init <replaceable>EXAMPLE.ORG</replaceable></userinput>
Realm max ticket life [unlimited]:</screen>

      <para>Lastly, while still in <command>kadmin</command>, create
	the first principal using <command>add</command>.  Stick to
	the default options for the principal for now, as these can be
	changed later with <command>modify</command>.
	Type <literal>?</literal> at the prompt to see the available
	options.</para>

      <screen>kadmin&gt; <userinput>add tillman</userinput>

      <para>Next, start the <acronym>KDC</acronym> services by
	running:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service kdc start</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>service kadmind start</userinput></screen>

      <para>While there will not be any kerberized daemons running at
	this point, it is possible to confirm that the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> is functioning by obtaining a ticket
	for the principal that was just created:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>kinit <replaceable>tillman</replaceable></userinput>

      <para>Confirm that a ticket was successfully obtained using

      <title>Configuring a Server to Use
	<application>Kerberos</application></title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>Kerberos5</primary>
	<secondary>enabling services</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The first step in configuring a server to use
	<application>Kerberos</application> authentication is to
	ensure that it has the correct configuration in
	<filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>.  The version from the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> can be used as-is, or it can be
	regenerated on the new system.</para>

      <para>Next, create <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename> on the
	server.  This is the main part of <quote>Kerberizing</quote> a
	service &mdash; it corresponds to generating a secret shared
	between the service and the <acronym>KDC</acronym>.  The
	secret is a cryptographic key, stored in a
	<quote>keytab</quote>.  The keytab contains the server's host
	key, which allows it and the <acronym>KDC</acronym> to verify
	each others' identity.  It must be transmitted to the server
	in a secure fashion, as the security of the server can be
	broken if the key is made public.  Typically, the
	<filename>keytab</filename> is generated on an administrator's
	trusted machine using <command>kadmin</command>, then securely
	transferred to the server, e.g., with &man.scp.1;; it can also
	be created directly on the server if that is consistent with
	the desired security policy.  It is very important that the
	keytab is transmitted to the server in a secure fashion: if
	the key is known by some other party, that party can
	impersonate any user to the server!  Using
	<command>kadmin</command> on the server directly is
	convenient, because the entry for the host principal in the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> database is also created using
	<command>kadmin</command>.</para>

      <para>Of course, <command>kadmin</command> is a kerberized
	service; a <application>Kerberos</application> ticket is
	needed to authenticate to the network service, but to ensure
	that the user running <command>kadmin</command> is actually
	present (and their session has not been hijacked),
	<command>kadmin</command> will prompt for the password to get
	a fresh ticket.  The principal authenticating to the kadmin
	service must be permitted to use the <command>kadmin</command>
	interface, as specified in
	<filename>/var/heimdal/kadmind.acl</filename>.  See the
	section titled <quote>Remote administration</quote> in
	<command>info heimdal</command> for details on designing
	access control lists.  Instead of enabling remote
	<command>kadmin</command> access, the administrator could
	securely connect to the <acronym>KDC</acronym> via the local
	console or &man.ssh.1;, and perform administration locally
	using <command>kadmin -l</command>.</para>

      <para>After installing <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>,
	use <command>add --random-key</command> in
	<command>kadmin</command>.  This adds the server's host
	principal to the database, but does not extract a copy of the
	host principal key to a keytab.  To generate the keytab, use
	<command>ext</command> to extract the server's host principal
	key to its own keytab:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kadmin</userinput>
kadmin&gt;<userinput> add --random-key host/myserver.example.org</userinput>
Max ticket life [unlimited]:
Max renewable life [unlimited]:
Principal expiration time [never]:
Password expiration time [never]:
Attributes []:
kadmin&gt;<userinput> ext_keytab <replaceable>host/myserver.example.org</replaceable></userinput>
kadmin&gt;<userinput> exit</userinput></screen>

      <para>Note that <command>ext_keytab</command> stores the
	extracted key in <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename> by
	default.  This is good when being run on the server being
	kerberized, but the <command>--keytab
	  <replaceable>path/to/file</replaceable></command> argument
	should be used when the keytab is being extracted
	elsewhere:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kadmin</userinput>
kadmin&gt;<userinput> ext_keytab --keytab=/tmp/example.keytab <replaceable>host/myserver.example.org</replaceable></userinput>
kadmin&gt;<userinput> exit</userinput></screen>

      <para>The keytab can then be securely copied to the server
	using &man.scp.1; or a removable media.  Be sure to specify a
	non-default keytab name to avoid inserting unneeded keys into
	the system's keytab.</para>

      <para>At this point, the server can read encrypted messages from
	the <acronym>KDC</acronym> using its shared key, stored in
	<filename>krb5.keytab</filename>.  It is now ready for the
	<application>Kerberos</application>-using services to be
	enabled.  One of the most common such services is
	&man.sshd.8;, which supports
	<application>Kerberos</application> via the
	<acronym>GSS-API</acronym>.  In
	<filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>, add the
	line:</para>

      <programlisting>GSSAPIAuthentication yes</programlisting>

      <para>After making this change, &man.sshd.8; must be restarted
	for the new configuration to take effect:
	<command>service sshd restart</command>.</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para>As it was for the server, the client requires

	the file in place (securely) or re-enter it as needed.</para>

      <para>Test the client by using <command>kinit</command>,
	<command>klist</command>, and <command>kdestroy</command> from
	the client to obtain, show, and then delete a ticket for an
	existing principal.  <application>Kerberos</application>
	applications should also be able to connect to
	<application>Kerberos</application> enabled servers.  If that
	does not work but obtaining a ticket does, the problem is
	likely with the server and not with the client or the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym>.  In the case of kerberized
	&man.ssh.1;, <acronym>GSS-API</acronym> is disabled by
	default, so test using <command>ssh -o
	  GSSAPIAuthentication=yes
	  <replaceable>hostname</replaceable></command>.</para>

      <para>When testing a Kerberized application, try using a packet
	sniffer such as <command>tcpdump</command> to confirm that no
	sensitive information is sent in the clear.</para>

      <para>Various <application>Kerberos</application> client
	applications are available.  With the advent of a bridge so
	that applications using <acronym>SASL</acronym> for
	authentication can use <acronym>GSS-API</acronym> mechanisms
	as well, large classes of client applications can use
	<application>Kerberos</application> for authentication, from
	Jabber clients to <acronym>IMAP</acronym> clients.</para>

      <para>Users within a realm typically have their
	<application>Kerberos</application> principal mapped to a
	local user account.  Occasionally, one needs to grant access
	to a local user account to someone who does not have a
	matching <application>Kerberos</application> principal.  For
	example, <systemitem
	  class="username">tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG</systemitem> may need
	access to the local user account <systemitem
	  class="username">webdevelopers</systemitem>.  Other
	principals may also need access to that local account.</para>

      <para>The <filename>.k5login</filename> and
	<filename>.k5users</filename> files, placed in a user's home
	directory, can be used to solve this problem.  For example, if
	the following <filename>.k5login</filename> is placed in the
	home directory of <systemitem
	  class="username">webdevelopers</systemitem>, both principals
	listed will have access to that account without requiring a
	shared password:</para>

      <title><acronym>MIT</acronym> Differences</title>

      <para>The major difference between the <acronym>MIT</acronym>
	and Heimdal implementations is that <command>kadmin</command>
	has a different, but equivalent, set of commands and uses a
	different protocol.  If the <acronym>KDC</acronym> is
	<acronym>MIT</acronym>, the Heimdal version of
	<command>kadmin</command> cannot be used to administer the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> remotely, and vice versa.</para>

      <para>Client applications may also use slightly different
	command line options to accomplish the same tasks.  Following
	the instructions at <link
	  xlink:href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/">http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/</link>
	is recommended.  Be careful of path issues: the
	<acronym>MIT</acronym> port installs into
	<filename>/usr/local/</filename> by default, and the &os;
	system applications run instead of the
	<acronym>MIT</acronym> versions if <envar>PATH</envar> lists
	the system directories first.</para>

      <para>When using MIT Kerberos as a <acronym>KDC</acronym> on

	Limitations</title>

	<secondary>limitations and shortcomings</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Since <application>Kerberos</application> is an all or
	nothing approach, every service enabled on the network must
	either be modified to work with
	<application>Kerberos</application> or be otherwise secured
	against network attacks.  This is to prevent user credentials
	from being stolen and re-used.  An example is when
	<application>Kerberos</application> is enabled on all remote
	shells but the non-Kerberized <acronym>POP3</acronym> mail
	server sends passwords in plain text.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>KDC</acronym> is a single point of failure.
	By design, the <acronym>KDC</acronym> must be as secure as its
	master password database.  The <acronym>KDC</acronym> should
	have absolutely no other services running on it and should be
	physically secure.  The danger is high because
	<application>Kerberos</application> stores all passwords
	encrypted with the same master key which is stored as a file
	on the <acronym>KDC</acronym>.</para>

      <para>A compromised master key is not quite as bad as one might
	fear.  The master key is only used to encrypt the
	<application>Kerberos</application> database and as a seed for
	the random number generator.  As long as access to the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> is secure, an attacker cannot do much
	with the master key.</para>

      <para>If the <acronym>KDC</acronym> is unavailable, network
	services are unusable as authentication cannot be performed.
	This can be alleviated with a single master
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> and one or more slaves, and with
	careful implementation of secondary or fall-back
	authentication using <acronym>PAM</acronym>.</para>

      <para><application>Kerberos</application> allows users, hosts
	and services to authenticate between themselves.  It does not
	have a mechanism to authenticate the
	<acronym>KDC</acronym> to the users, hosts, or services.  This
	means that a trojaned <command>kinit</command> could record
	all user names and passwords.  File system integrity checking
	tools like <package>security/tripwire</package> can
	alleviate this.</para>

    <para><application>OpenSSL</application> is an open source
      implementation of the <acronym>SSL</acronym> and
      <acronym>TLS</acronym> protocols.  It provides an encryption
      transport layer on top of the normal communications layer,
      allowing it to be intertwined with many network applications and
      services.</para>

    <para>The version of <application>OpenSSL</application> included
      in &os; supports the Secure Sockets Layer 3.0 (SSLv3)
      and Transport Layer Security 1.0/1.1/1.2 (TLSv1/TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2)
      network security
      protocols and can be used as a general cryptographic
      library.  In &os; 12.0-RELEASE and above, OpenSSL also supports
      Transport Layer Security 1.3 (TLSv1.3).</para>

    <para><application>OpenSSL</application> is often used to encrypt
      authentication of mail clients and to secure web based
      transactions such as credit card payments.  Some ports, such as
      <package>www/apache24</package> and
      <package>databases/postgresql11-server</package>, include a
      compile option for building with
      <application>OpenSSL</application>.  If selected, the port will
      add support using <application>OpenSSL</application> from the
      base system.  To instead have the port compile against
      <application>OpenSSL</application> from the
      <package>security/openssl</package> port, add the following to
      <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= ssl=openssl</programlisting>

    <para>Another common use of <application>OpenSSL</application> is
      to provide certificates for use with software applications.
      Certificates can be used to verify the credentials of a company
      or individual.  If a certificate has not been signed by an
      external <firstterm>Certificate Authority</firstterm>
      (<acronym>CA</acronym>), such as <link
	xlink:href="http://www.verisign.com">http://www.verisign.com</link>,
      the application that uses the certificate will produce a
      warning.  There is a cost associated with obtaining a signed
      certificate and using a signed certificate is not mandatory as
      certificates can be self-signed.  However, using an external
      authority will prevent warnings and can put users at
      ease.</para>

    <para>This section demonstrates how to create and use certificates
      on a &os; system.  Refer to <xref linkend="ldap-config"/> for an
      example of how to create a <acronym>CA</acronym> for signing
      one's own certificates.</para>

	qualified name for the system that will use the certificate.
	If this name does not match the server, the application

What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

      <para>Other options, such as the expire time and alternate
	encryption algorithms, are available when creating a
	certificate.  A complete list of options is described in
	&man.openssl.1;.</para>

      <para>This command will create two files in the current
	directory.  The certificate request,
	<filename>req.pem</filename>, can be sent to a
	<acronym>CA</acronym> who will validate the entered
	credentials, sign the request, and return the signed
	certificate.  The second file,
	<filename>cert.key</filename>, is the private key for the
	certificate and should be stored in a secure location.  If
	this falls in the hands of others, it can be used to
	impersonate the user or the server.</para>

      <para>Alternately, if a signature from a <acronym>CA</acronym>
	is not required, a self-signed certificate can be created.
	First, generate the <acronym>RSA</acronym> key:</para>

      <title>Using Certificates</title>

      <para>One use for a certificate is to encrypt connections to the

      <note>
	<para>Some mail clients will display an error if the user has

      </note>

      <para>In &os; 10.0-RELEASE and above, it is possible to create a

      <programlisting>sendmail_enable="YES"
sendmail_cert_create="YES"
sendmail_cert_cn="<replaceable>localhost.example.org</replaceable>"</programlisting>

      <para>This will automatically create a self-signed certificate,
	<filename>/etc/mail/certs/host.cert</filename>, a signing key,
	<filename>/etc/mail/certs/host.key</filename>, and a
	<acronym>CA</acronym> certificate,
	<filename>/etc/mail/certs/cacert.pem</filename>.  The

      <para>At this point, both networks should be available and seem

    <para><application>OpenSSH</application> is a set of network
      connectivity tools used to provide secure access to remote
      machines.  Additionally, <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> connections
      can be tunneled or forwarded securely through
      <acronym>SSH</acronym> connections.
      <application>OpenSSH</application> encrypts all traffic to
      effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and
      other network-level attacks.</para>

    <para><application>OpenSSH</application> is maintained by the
      OpenBSD project and is installed by default in &os;.  It is
      compatible with both <acronym>SSH</acronym> version 1 and 2
      protocols.</para>

    <para>When data is sent over the network in an unencrypted form,
      network sniffers anywhere in between the client and server can
      steal user/password information or data transferred during the
      session.  <application>OpenSSH</application> offers a variety of
      authentication and encryption methods to prevent this from
      happening.  More information about
      <application>OpenSSH</application> is available from <link
	xlink:href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</link>.</para>

    <para>This section provides an overview of the built-in client
      utilities to securely access other systems and securely transfer
      files from a &os; system.  It then describes how to configure a
      <acronym>SSH</acronym> server on a &os; system.  More
      information is available in the man pages mentioned in this

      <para>To log into a <acronym>SSH</acronym> server, use
	<command>ssh</command> and specify a username that exists on
	that server and the <acronym>IP</acronym> address or hostname
	of the server.  If this is the first time a connection has
	been made to the specified server, the user will be prompted
	to first verify the server's fingerprint:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ssh <replaceable>user@example.com</replaceable></userinput>
The authenticity of host 'example.com (10.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 25:cc:73:b5:b3:96:75:3d:56:19:49:d2:5c:1f:91:3b.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <userinput>yes</userinput>
Permanently added 'example.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Password for user@example.com: <userinput><replaceable>user_password</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para><acronym>SSH</acronym> utilizes a key fingerprint system
	to verify the authenticity of the server when the client
	connects.  When the user accepts the key's fingerprint by
	typing <literal>yes</literal> when connecting for the first
	time, a copy of the key is saved to
	<filename>.ssh/known_hosts</filename> in the user's home
	directory.  Future attempts to login are verified against the
	saved key and <command>ssh</command> will display an alert if
	the server's key does not match the saved key.  If this
	occurs, the user should first verify why the key has changed
	before continuing with the connection.</para>

      <para>By default, recent versions of
	<application>OpenSSH</application> only accept
	<acronym>SSH</acronym>v2 connections.  By default, the client
	will use version 2 if possible and will fall back to version 1
	if the server does not support version 2.  To force
	<command>ssh</command> to only use the specified protocol,
	include <option>-1</option> or <option>-2</option>.
	Additional options are described in &man.ssh.1;.</para>

      <para>Use &man.scp.1; to securely copy a file to or from a
	remote machine.  This example copies
	<filename>COPYRIGHT</filename> on the remote system to a file

      <para>Since the fingerprint was already verified for this host,
	the server's key is automatically checked before prompting for
	the user's password.</para>

      <para>The arguments passed to <command>scp</command> are similar
	to <command>cp</command>.  The file or files to copy is the
	first argument and the destination to copy to is the second.
	Since the file is fetched over the network, one or more of the
	file arguments takes the form
	<option>user@host:&lt;path_to_remote_file&gt;</option>.  Be
	aware when copying directories recursively that
	<command>scp</command> uses <option>-r</option>, whereas
	<command>cp</command> uses <option>-R</option>.</para>

      <para>To open an interactive session for copying files, use
	<command>sftp</command>.  Refer to &man.sftp.1; for a list of

	  <emphasis>public</emphasis> key must be copied to
	  <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> on the remote
	  machine for key-based authentication to
	  work.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>Many users believe that keys are secure by design and
	    will use a key without a passphrase.  This is
	    <emphasis>dangerous</emphasis> behavior.  An
	    administrator can verify that a key pair is protected by a
	    passphrase by viewing the private key manually.  If the
	    private key file contains the word
	    <literal>ENCRYPTED</literal>, the key owner is using a
	    passphrase.  In addition, to better secure end users,
	    <literal>from</literal> may be placed in the public key
	    file.  For example, adding
	    <literal>from="192.168.10.5"</literal> in front of the
	    <literal>ssh-rsa</literal>
	    prefix will only allow that specific user to log in from
	    that <acronym>IP</acronym> address.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>The options and files vary with different versions of
	  <application>OpenSSH</application>.
	  To avoid problems, consult &man.ssh-keygen.1;.</para>

	<para>If a passphrase is used, the user is prompted for
	  the passphrase each time a connection is made to the server.
	  To load <acronym>SSH</acronym> keys into memory and remove
	  the need to type the passphrase each time, use
	  &man.ssh-agent.1; and &man.ssh-add.1;.</para>

	<para>Authentication is handled by
	  <command>ssh-agent</command>, using the private keys that
	  are loaded into it.  <command>ssh-agent</command>
	  can be used to launch another application like a
	  shell or a window manager.</para>

	<para>To use <command>ssh-agent</command> in a shell, start it
	  with a shell as an argument.  Add the identity by
	  running <command>ssh-add</command> and entering the
	  passphrase for the private key.
	  The user will then be able to <command>ssh</command>
	  to any host that has the corresponding public key installed.
	  For example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ssh-agent <replaceable>csh</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>ssh-add</userinput>
Enter passphrase for key '/usr/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa':  <co xml:id="co-ssh-agent-passphrase"/>
Identity added: /usr/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa (/usr/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa)
&prompt.user;</screen>

	<calloutlist>
	  <callout arearefs="co-ssh-agent-passphrase">
	    <para>Enter the passphrase for the key.</para>
	  </callout>
	</calloutlist>

	<para>To use <command>ssh-agent</command> in
	  <application>&xorg;</application>, add an entry for it in
	  <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>.  This provides the
	  <command>ssh-agent</command> services to all programs
	  launched in <application>&xorg;</application>.  An example
	  <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename> might look like this:</para>

	<programlisting>exec ssh-agent <replaceable>startxfce4</replaceable></programlisting>

	<para>This launches <command>ssh-agent</command>, which in
	  turn launches <application>XFCE</application>, every time
	  <application>&xorg;</application> starts.  Once
	  <application>&xorg;</application> has been restarted so that
	  the changes can take effect, run <command>ssh-add</command>
	  to load all of the <acronym>SSH</acronym> keys.</para>

	  <title>Secure Access of a <acronym>POP3</acronym>
	    Server</title>

	  <para>In this example, there is an <acronym>SSH</acronym>
	    server that accepts connections from the outside.  On the
	    same network resides a mail server running a
	    <acronym>POP3</acronym> server.  To check email in a
	    secure manner, create an <acronym>SSH</acronym> connection
	    to the <acronym>SSH</acronym> server and tunnel through to
	    the mail server:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ssh -2 -N -f -L <replaceable>2110:mail.example.com:110 user@ssh-server.example.com</replaceable></userinput>
user@ssh-server.example.com's password: <userinput>******</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Once the tunnel is up and running, point the email
	    client to send <acronym>POP3</acronym> requests to
	    <systemitem>localhost</systemitem> on port 2110.  This
	    connection will be forwarded securely across the tunnel to
	    <systemitem>mail.example.com</systemitem>.</para>
	</example>

	<example>
	  <title>Bypassing a Firewall</title>

	  <para>Some firewalls
	    filter both incoming and outgoing connections.  For
	    example, a firewall might limit access from remote
	    machines to ports 22 and 80 to only allow
	    <acronym>SSH</acronym> and web surfing.  This prevents
	    access to any other service which uses a port other than
	    22 or 80.</para>

	  <para>The solution is to create an <acronym>SSH</acronym>
	    connection to a machine outside of the network's firewall
	    and use it to tunnel to the desired service:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ssh -2 -N -f -L <replaceable>8888:music.example.com:8000 user@unfirewalled-system.example.org</replaceable></userinput>
user@unfirewalled-system.example.org's password: <userinput>*******</userinput></screen>

	  <para>In this example, a streaming Ogg Vorbis client can now
	    be pointed to <systemitem>localhost</systemitem> port
	    8888, which will be forwarded over to

      <title>SSH Server Security</title>

      <para>While <application>sshd</application> is the most widely
	used remote administration facility for &os;, brute force
	and drive by attacks are common to any system exposed to
	public networks.  Several additional parameters are available
	to prevent the success of these attacks and will be described
	in this section.</para>

      <para>It is a good idea to limit which users can log into the
	<acronym>SSH</acronym> server and from where using the
	<literal>AllowUsers</literal> keyword in the
	<application>OpenSSH</application> server configuration file.
	For example, to only allow <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem> to log in from
	<systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.1.32</systemitem>, add
	this line to <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers root@192.168.1.32</programlisting>

      <para>To allow <systemitem class="username">admin</systemitem>
	to log in from anywhere, list that user without specifying an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers admin</programlisting>

      <para>Multiple users should be listed on the same line, like
	so:</para>

      <programlisting>AllowUsers root@192.168.1.32 admin</programlisting>

      <para>After making changes to
	<filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>,
	tell <application>sshd</application> to reload its
	configuration file by running:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sshd reload</userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>When this keyword is used, it is important to list each
	  user that needs to log into this machine.  Any user that is
	  not specified in that line will be locked out.  Also, the
	  keywords used in the <application>OpenSSH</application>
	  server configuration file are case-sensitive.  If the
	  keyword is not spelled correctly, including its case, it
	  will be ignored.  Always test changes to this file to make
	  sure that the edits are working as expected.  Refer to
	  &man.sshd.config.5; to verify the spelling and use of the
	  available keywords.</para>
      </note>

      <para>In addition, users may be forced to use two factor
	authentication via the use of a public and private key.  When
	required, the user may generate a key pair through the use
	of &man.ssh-keygen.1; and send the administrator the public
	key.  This key file will be placed in the
	<filename>authorized_keys</filename> as described above in
	the client section.  To force the users to use keys only,

    <para>Access Control Lists (<acronym>ACL</acronym>s) extend the

      This permits an administrator to take advantage of a more

    <para>The &os; <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel provides
      <acronym>ACL</acronym> support for <acronym>UFS</acronym> file
      systems.  Users who prefer to compile a custom kernel must

      configuration file:</para>

    <para>If this option is not compiled in, a warning message will be

      extended attributes which are natively supported in
      <acronym>UFS2</acronym>.</para>

    <para>This chapter describes how to enable
      <acronym>ACL</acronym> support and provides some usage
      examples.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling <acronym>ACL</acronym> Support</title>

      <para><acronym>ACL</acronym>s are enabled by the mount-time
	administrative flag, <option>acls</option>, which may be added
	to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.  The mount-time flag can
	also be automatically set in a persistent manner using
	&man.tunefs.8; to modify a superblock <acronym>ACL</acronym>s
	flag in the file system header.  In general, it is preferred
	to use the superblock flag for several reasons:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The superblock flag cannot be changed by a remount
	    using <option>mount -u</option> as it requires a complete
	    <command>umount</command> and fresh
	    <command>mount</command>.  This means that
	    <acronym>ACL</acronym>s cannot be enabled on the root file
	    system after boot.  It also means that
	    <acronym>ACL</acronym> support on a file system cannot be
	    changed while the system is in use.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Setting the superblock flag causes the file system to
	    always be mounted with <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled,
	    even if there is not an <filename>fstab</filename> entry
	    or if the devices re-order.  This prevents accidental
	    mounting of the file system without <acronym>ACL</acronym>
	    support.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <note>
	<para>It is desirable to discourage accidental mounting
	  without <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled because nasty things
	  can happen if <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are enabled, then
	  disabled, then re-enabled without flushing the extended
	  attributes.  In general, once <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are
	  enabled on a file system, they should not be disabled, as
	  the resulting file protections may not be compatible with
	  those intended by the users of the system, and re-enabling
	  <acronym>ACL</acronym>s may re-attach the previous
	  <acronym>ACL</acronym>s to files that have since had their
	  permissions changed, resulting in unpredictable
	  behavior.</para>
      </note>

      <para>File systems with <acronym>ACL</acronym>s enabled will
	show a plus (<literal>+</literal>) sign in their permission
	settings:</para>

      <title>Using <acronym>ACL</acronym>s</title>

      <para>File system <acronym>ACL</acronym>s can be viewed using

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>getfacl test</userinput>
	#file:test

	#group:1001
	user::rw-
	group::r--
	other::r--</screen>

      <para>To change the <acronym>ACL</acronym> settings on this
	file, use <command>setfacl</command>.  To remove all of the
	currently defined <acronym>ACL</acronym>s from a file or file
	system, include <option>-k</option>.  However, the preferred
	method is to use <option>-b</option> as it leaves the basic
	fields required for <acronym>ACL</acronym>s to work.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>setfacl -k test</userinput></screen>

      <para>To modify the default <acronym>ACL</acronym> entries, use
	<option>-m</option>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>setfacl -m u:trhodes:rwx,group:web:r--,o::--- test</userinput></screen>

      <para>In this example, there were no pre-defined entries, as

    <para>In recent years, the security world has made many
      improvements to how vulnerability assessment is handled.  The
      threat of system intrusion increases as third party utilities
      are installed and configured for virtually any operating
      system available today.</para>

    <para>Vulnerability assessment is a key factor in security.
      While &os; releases advisories for the base system, doing so
      for every third party utility is beyond the &os; Project's
      capability.  There is a way to mitigate third party
      vulnerabilities and warn administrators of known security
      issues.  A &os; add on utility known as
      <application>pkg</application> includes options explicitly for
      this purpose.</para>

    <para><application>pkg</application> polls a database for security
      issues.  The database is updated and maintained by the &os;
      Security Team and ports developers.</para>

    <para>Please refer to <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/pkgng-intro.html">instructions</link>
      for installing
      <application>pkg</application>.</para>

    <para>Installation provides &man.periodic.8; configuration files
      for maintaining the <application>pkg</application> audit
      database, and provides a programmatic method of keeping it
      updated.  This functionality is enabled if
      <literal>daily_status_security_pkgaudit_enable</literal>
      is set to <literal>YES</literal> in &man.periodic.conf.5;.
      Ensure that daily security run emails, which are sent to
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>'s email account,
      are being read.</para>

    <para>After installation, and to audit third party utilities as
      part of the Ports Collection at any time, an administrator may
      choose to update the database and view known vulnerabilities
      of installed packages by invoking:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg audit -F</userinput></screen>

    <para><application>pkg</application> displays messages
      any published vulnerabilities in installed packages:</para>

    <programlisting>Affected package: cups-base-1.1.22.0_1
Type of problem: cups-base -- HPGL buffer overflow vulnerability.
Reference: &lt;https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/portaudit/40a3bca2-6809-11d9-a9e7-0001020eed82.html&gt;

1 problem(s) in your installed packages found.

You are advised to update or deinstall the affected package(s) immediately.</programlisting>

    <para>By pointing a web browser to the displayed
      <acronym>URL</acronym>, an administrator may obtain more
      information about the vulnerability.  This will include the
      versions affected, by &os; port version, along with other web
      sites which may contain security advisories.</para>

    <para><application>pkg</application> is a powerful utility
      and is extremely useful when coupled with
      <package>ports-mgmt/portmaster</package>.</para>

    <para>Like many producers of quality operating systems, the &os;
      Project has a security team which is responsible for
      determining the End-of-Life (<acronym>EoL</acronym>) date for
      each &os; release and to provide security updates for supported
      releases which have not yet reached their
      <acronym>EoL</acronym>.  More information about the &os;
      security team and the supported releases is available on the
      <link xlink:href="&url.base;/security">&os; security
	page</link>.</para>

    <para>One task of the security team is to respond to reported
      security vulnerabilities in the &os; operating system.  Once a
      vulnerability is confirmed, the security team verifies the steps
      necessary to fix the vulnerability and updates the source code
      with the fix.  It then publishes the details as a
      <quote>Security Advisory</quote>.  Security
      advisories are published on the <link
	xlink:href="&url.base;/security/advisories.html">&os;
	website</link> and mailed to the
      &a.security-notifications.name;, &a.security.name;, and
      &a.announce.name; mailing lists.</para>

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit &lt;URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/&gt;.

I.   Background

BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.

II.  Problem Description

Because of a defect in handling queries for NSEC3-signed zones, BIND can
crash with an "INSIST" failure in name.c when processing queries possessing
certain properties.  This issue only affects authoritative nameservers with
at least one NSEC3-signed zone.  Recursive-only servers are not at risk.

III. Impact

An attacker who can send a specially crafted query could cause named(8)
to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not running authoritative DNS service
with at least one NSEC3-signed zone using named(8) are not vulnerable.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 8.3, 8.4, 9.1, 9.2-RELEASE and 8.4-STABLE]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:04/bind-release.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:04/bind-release.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bind-release.patch.asc

[FreeBSD 9.2-STABLE]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:04/bind-stable-9.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:04/bind-stable-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bind-stable-9.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch &lt; /path/to/patch

Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in &lt;URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html&gt;.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

VI.  Correction details

      <primary>Process Accounting</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Process accounting is a security method in which an
      administrator may keep track of system resources used and
      their allocation among users, provide for system monitoring,
      and minimally track a user's commands.</para>

    <para>Process accounting has both positive and negative points.
      One of the positives is that an intrusion may be narrowed down
      to the point of entry.  A negative is the amount of logs
      generated by process accounting, and the disk space they may
      require.  This section walks an administrator through the basics
      of process accounting.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If more fine-grained accounting is needed, refer to
	<xref linkend="audit"/>.</para>
    </note>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling and Utilizing Process Accounting</title>

      <para>Before using process accounting, it must be enabled using
	the following commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysrc accounting_enable=yes</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>service accounting start</userinput></screen>

      <para>The accounting information is stored in files located in
	<filename>/var/account</filename>, which is automatically created,
	if necessary, the first time the accounting service starts.
	These files contain sensitive information, including all the
	commands issued by all users.  Write access to the files is
	limited to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>,
	and read access is limited to <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem> and members of the
	<systemitem class="groupname">wheel</systemitem> group.
	To also prevent	members of <systemitem
	  class="groupname">wheel</systemitem> from reading the files,
	change the mode of the <filename>/var/account</filename>
	directory to allow access only by <systemitem
          class="username">root</systemitem>.</para>

      <para>Once enabled, accounting will begin to track information
	such as <acronym>CPU</acronym> statistics and executed
	commands.  All accounting logs are in a non-human readable
	format which can be viewed using <command>sa</command>.  If
	issued without any options, <command>sa</command> prints
	information relating to the number of per-user calls, the
	total elapsed time in minutes, total <acronym>CPU</acronym>
	and user time in minutes, and the average number of
	<acronym>I/O</acronym> operations.  Refer to &man.sa.8; for
	the list of available options which control the output.</para>

      <para>To display the commands issued by users, use
	<command>lastcomm</command>.  For example, this command
	prints out all usage of <command>ls</command> by <systemitem
	  class="username">trhodes</systemitem> on the
	<literal>ttyp1</literal> terminal:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>lastcomm ls trhodes ttyp1</userinput></screen>

      <para>Many other useful options exist and are explained in
	&man.lastcomm.1;, &man.acct.5;, and &man.sa.8;.</para>

      <primary>Resource limits</primary>
    </indexterm>

      <para>&os; provides several methods for an administrator to
	limit the amount of system resources an individual may use.
	Disk quotas limit the amount of disk space available to users.
	Quotas are discussed in <xref linkend="quotas"/>.</para>

	<primary>disk quotas</primary>
      </indexterm>

    <para>Limits to other resources, such as <acronym>CPU</acronym>
      and memory, can be set using either a flat file or a command to
      configure a resource limits database.  The traditional method
      defines login classes by editing
      <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.  While this method is
      still supported, any changes require a multi-step process of
      editing this file, rebuilding the resource database, making
      necessary changes to <filename>/etc/master.passwd</filename>,
      and rebuilding the password database.  This can become time
      consuming, depending upon the number of users to
      configure.</para>

    <para><command>rctl</command> can be used to provide a more
      fine-grained method for controlling resource limits.  This
      command supports more than user limits as it can also be used to
      set resource constraints on processes and jails.</para>

    <para>This section demonstrates both methods for controlling
      resources, beginning with the traditional method.</para>

	<primary><filename>/etc/login.conf</filename></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>In the traditional method, login classes and the resource
	limits to apply to a login class are defined in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.   Each user account can
	be assigned to a login class, where <literal>default</literal>
	is the default login class.  Each login class has a set of
	login capabilities associated with it.  A login capability is
	a
	<literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>
	pair, where <replaceable>name</replaceable> is a well-known
	identifier and <replaceable>value</replaceable> is an
	arbitrary string which is processed accordingly depending on
	the <replaceable>name</replaceable>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Whenever <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> is edited,
	  the <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> must be updated
	  by executing the following command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</userinput></screen>
      </note>

      <para>Resource limits differ from the default login capabilities
	in two ways.  First, for every limit, there is a
	<firstterm>soft</firstterm> and <firstterm>hard</firstterm>
	limit.  A soft limit may be adjusted by the user or
	application, but may not be set higher than the hard limit.
	The hard limit may be lowered by the user, but can only be
	raised by the superuser.  Second, most resource limits apply
	per process to a specific user.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="resource-limits"/> lists the most commonly
	used resource limits.  All of the available resource limits
	and capabilities are described in detail in
	&man.login.conf.5;.</para>

	  <para>Although the default

	    reasonable values for most limits, they may not be

	  <para>Many limits apply to individual processes, not the
	    user as a whole.  For example, setting
	    <varname>openfiles</varname> to <literal>50</literal>
	    means that each process the user runs may open up to
	    <literal>50</literal> files.  The total amount of files a

      <title>Enabling and Configuring Resource Limits</title>

      <para>The <varname>kern.racct.enable</varname> tunable must be
	set to a non-zero value.  Custom kernels require specific
	configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>options         RACCT
options         RCTL</programlisting>

      <para>Once the system has rebooted into the new kernel,
	<command>rctl</command> may be used to set rules for the
	system.</para>

      <para>Rule syntax is controlled through the use of a subject,
	subject-id, resource, and action, as seen in this example
	rule:</para>

      <programlisting>user:trhodes:maxproc:deny=10/user</programlisting>

      <para>In this rule, the subject is <literal>user</literal>, the
	subject-id is <literal>trhodes</literal>, the resource,
	<literal>maxproc</literal>, is the maximum number of
	processes, and the action is <literal>deny</literal>, which
	blocks any new processes from being created.  This means that
	the user, <literal>trhodes</literal>, will be constrained to
	no greater than <literal>10</literal> processes.  Other
	possible actions include logging to the console, passing a
	notification to &man.devd.8;, or sending a sigterm to the
	process.</para>

      <para>Some care must be taken when adding rules.  Since this
	user is constrained to <literal>10</literal> processes, this
	example will prevent the user from performing other tasks
	after logging in and executing a
	<command>screen</command> session.  Once a resource limit has
	been hit, an error will be printed, as in this example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>man test</userinput>
    /usr/bin/man: Cannot fork: Resource temporarily unavailable
eval: Cannot fork: Resource temporarily unavailable</screen>

      <para>As another example, a jail can be prevented from exceeding
	a memory limit.  This rule could be written as:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rctl -a jail:httpd:memoryuse:deny=2G/jail</userinput></screen>

      <para>Rules will persist across reboots if they have been added
	to <filename>/etc/rctl.conf</filename>.  The format is a rule,
	without the preceding command.  For example, the previous rule
	could be added as:</para>

      <programlisting># Block jail from using more than 2G memory:
jail:httpd:memoryuse:deny=2G/jail</programlisting>

      <para>To remove a rule, use <command>rctl</command> to remove it
	from the list:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rctl -r user:trhodes:maxproc:deny=10/user</userinput></screen>

      <para>A method for removing all rules is documented in
	&man.rctl.8;.  However, if removing all rules for a single
	user is required, this command may be issued:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rctl -r user:trhodes</userinput></screen>

      <para>Many other resources exist which can be used to exert
	additional control over various <literal>subjects</literal>.
	See &man.rctl.8; to learn about them.</para>

      <secondary>Sudo</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>System administrators often need the ability to grant
      enhanced permissions to users so they may perform privileged
      tasks.  The idea that team members are provided access
      to a &os; system to perform their specific tasks opens up unique
      challenges to every administrator.  These team members only
      need a subset of access beyond normal end user levels; however,
      they almost always tell management they are unable to
      perform their tasks without superuser access.  Thankfully, there
      is no reason to provide such access to end users because tools
      exist to manage this exact requirement.</para>

    <para>Up to this point, the security chapter has covered
      permitting access to authorized users and attempting to prevent
      unauthorized access.  Another problem arises once authorized
      users have access to the system resources.  In many cases, some
      users may need access to application startup scripts, or a team
      of administrators need to maintain the system.  Traditionally,
      the standard users and groups, file permissions, and even the
      &man.su.1; command would manage this access.  And as
      applications required more access, as more users needed to use
      system resources, a better solution was required.  The most used
      application is currently <application>Sudo</application>.</para>

    <para><application>Sudo</application> allows administrators
      to configure more rigid access to system commands
      and provide for some advanced logging features.
      As a tool, it is available from the Ports Collection as
      <package role="port">security/sudo</package> or by use of
      the &man.pkg.8; utility.  To use the &man.pkg.8; tool:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install sudo</userinput></screen>

    <para>After the installation is complete, the installed
      <command>visudo</command> will open the configuration file with
      a text editor.  Using <command>visudo</command> is highly
      recommended as it comes with a built in syntax checker to verify
      there are no errors before the file is saved.</para>

    <para>The configuration file is made up of several small sections
      which allow for extensive configuration.  In the following
      example, web application maintainer, user1, needs to start,
      stop, and restart the web application known as
      <replaceable>webservice</replaceable>.  To
      grant this user permission to perform these tasks, add
      this line to the end of
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/sudoers</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>user1   ALL=(ALL)       /usr/sbin/service webservice *</programlisting>

    <para>The user may now start <replaceable>webservice</replaceable>
      using this command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>sudo /usr/sbin/service <replaceable>webservice</replaceable> start</userinput></screen>

    <para>While this configuration allows a single user access to the
      <application>webservice</application> service; however, in most
      organizations, there is an entire web team in charge of managing
      the service.  A single line can also give access to an entire
      group.  These steps will create a web group, add a user to this
      group, and allow all members of the group to manage the
      service:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupadd -g 6001 -n webteam</userinput></screen>

    <para>Using the same &man.pw.8; command, the user is added to
      the webteam group:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod -m user1 -n webteam</userinput></screen>

    <para>Finally, this line in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/sudoers</filename> allows any
      member of the webteam group to manage
      <replaceable>webservice</replaceable>:</para>

    <programlisting>%webteam   ALL=(ALL)       /usr/sbin/service webservice *</programlisting>

    <para>Unlike &man.su.1;, <application>Sudo</application> only
      requires the end user password.  This adds an advantage where
      users will not need shared passwords, a finding in most security
      audits and just bad all the way around.</para>

    <para>Users permitted to run applications with
      <application>Sudo</application> only enter their own passwords.
      This is more secure and gives better control than &man.su.1;,
      where the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      password is entered and the user acquires all
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      permissions.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Most organizations are moving or have moved toward a two
	factor authentication model.  In these cases, the user may not
	have a password to enter.  <application>Sudo</application>
	provides for these cases with the <literal>NOPASSWD</literal>
	variable.  Adding it to the configuration above will allow all
	members of the <replaceable>webteam</replaceable> group to
	manage the service without the password requirement:</para>

      <programlisting>%webteam   ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service webservice *</programlisting>
    </tip>

    <sect2 xml:id="security-sudo-loggin">
      <title>Logging Output</title>

      <para>An advantage to implementing
	<application>Sudo</application> is the ability to enable
	session logging.  Using the built in log mechanisms
	and the included <application>sudoreplay</application>
	command, all commands initiated through
	<application>Sudo</application> are logged for later
	verification.  To enable this feature, add a default log
	directory entry, this example uses a user variable.
	Several other log filename conventions exist, consult the
	manual page for <application>sudoreplay</application> for
	additional information.</para>

      <programlisting>Defaults iolog_dir=/var/log/sudo-io/%{user}</programlisting>

      <tip>
	<para>This directory will be created automatically after the
	  logging is configured.  It is best to let the system create
	  directory with default permissions just to be safe.  In
	  addition, this entry will also log administrators who use
	  the <application>sudoreplay</application> command.  To
	  change this behavior, read and uncomment the logging options
	  inside <filename>sudoers</filename>.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Once this directive has been added to the
	<filename>sudoers</filename> file, any user configuration can
	be updated with the request to log access.  In the example
	shown, the updated <replaceable>webteam</replaceable> entry
	would have the following additional changes:</para>

      <programlisting>%webteam ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: LOG_INPUT: LOG_OUTPUT: /usr/sbin/service webservice *</programlisting>

      <para>From this point on, all <replaceable>webteam</replaceable>
	members altering the status of the
	<replaceable>webservice</replaceable> application
	will be logged.  The list of previous and current sessions
	can be displayed with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sudoreplay -l</userinput></screen>

      <para>In the output, to replay a specific session, search for
	the <literal>TSID=</literal> entry, and pass that to
	<application>sudoreplay</application> with no other options to
	replay the session at normal speed.  For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sudoreplay user1/00/00/02</userinput></screen>

      <warning>
	<para>While sessions are logged, any administrator is able to
	  remove sessions and leave only a question of why they had
	  done so.  It is worthwhile to add a daily check through an
	  intrusion detection system (<acronym>IDS</acronym>) or
	  similar software so that other administrators are alerted to
	  manual alterations.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The <command>sudoreplay</command> is extremely extendable.
	Consult the documentation for more information.</para>

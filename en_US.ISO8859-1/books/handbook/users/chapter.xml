    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>&os; allows multiple users to use the computer at the same
      time.  While only one user can sit in front of the screen and
      use the keyboard at any one time, any number of users can log
      in to the system through the network.  To use the system, every
      user must have a user account.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Since all access to the &os; system is achieved via accounts
      and all processes are run by users, user and account management
      is important.</para>

    <para>Every account on a &os; system has certain information
      associated with it to identify the account.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>User name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name is typed at the <prompt>login:</prompt>
	    prompt.  User names must be unique on the system as no two
	    users can have the same user name.  There are a number of
	    rules for creating valid user names, documented in
	    &man.passwd.5;.  Typically user names consist of eight or
	    fewer all lower case characters in order to maintain
	    backwards compatibility with applications.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Each account has an associated password.  While the
	    password can be blank, this is highly discouraged and
	    every account should have a password.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User ID (<acronym>UID</acronym>)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The User ID (<acronym>UID</acronym>) is a number,
	    traditionally from 0 to 65535<footnote
	      id="users-largeuidgid">
	      <para>It is possible to use
		<acronym>UID</acronym>s/<acronym>GID</acronym>s as
		large as 4294967295, but such IDs can cause serious
		problems with software that makes assumptions about
		the values of IDs.</para>
	      </footnote>, used to uniquely identify the user to the
	    system.  Internally, &os; uses the
	    <acronym>UID</acronym> to identify users.  Commands that
	    allow a user name to be specified will first convert it to
	    the <acronym>UID</acronym>.  Though unlikely, it is
	    possible for several accounts with different user names to
	    share the same <acronym>UID</acronym>.  As far as &os; is
	    concerned, these accounts are one user.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Group ID (<acronym>GID</acronym>)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The Group ID (<acronym>GID</acronym>) is a number,
	    traditionally from 0 to 65535<footnoteref
	      linkend="users-largeuidgid"/>, used to uniquely identify
	    the primary group that the user belongs to.  Groups are a
	    mechanism for controlling access to resources based on a
	    user's <acronym>GID</acronym> rather than their
	    <acronym>UID</acronym>.  This can significantly reduce the
	    size of some configuration files.  A user may also be a
	    member of more than one group.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Login class</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Login classes are an extension to the group mechanism
	    that provide additional flexibility when tailoring the
	    system to different users.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password change time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default &os; does not force users to change their
	    passwords periodically.  Password expiration can be
	    enforced on a per-user basis, forcing some or all users to
	    change their passwords after a certain amount of time has
	    elapsed.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Account expiry time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default &os; does not expire accounts.  When
	    creating accounts that need a limited lifespan, such as
	    student accounts in a school, specify the account expiry
	    date.  After the expiry time has elapsed, the account
	    cannot be used to log in to the system, although the
	    account's directories and files will remain.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User's full name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name uniquely identifies the account to &os;,
	    but does not necessarily reflect the user's real name.
	    This information can be associated with the
	    account.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Home directory</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The home directory is the full path to a directory on
	    the system.  This is the user's starting directory when
	    the user logs in.  A common convention is to put all user
	    home directories under <filename
	      class="directory">/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>
	    or <filename
	      class="directory">/usr/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>.
	    Each user stores their personal files and subdirectories
	    in their own home directory.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User shell</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The shell provides the default environment users use
	    to interact with the system.  There are many different
	    kinds of shells, and experienced users will have their own
	    preferences, which can be reflected in their account
	    settings.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>There are three main types of accounts: the <link
	linkend="users-superuser">superuser</link>, <link
	linkend="users-system">system accounts</link>, and <link
	linkend="users-user">user accounts</link>.  The superuser
      account, usually called <username>root</username>, is used to
      manage the system with no limitations on privileges.  System
      accounts are used to run services.  User accounts are
      assigned to real people and are used to log in and use the
      system.</para>

    <sect2 id="users-superuser">
      <title>The Superuser Account</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary>superuser (root)</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The superuser account, usually called
	<username>root</username>, is used to perform system
	administration tasks and should not be used for day-to-day
	tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of
	the system, or programming.</para>

      <para>This is because the superuser, unlike normal user
	accounts, can operate without limits, and misuse of the
	superuser account may result in spectacular disasters.  User
	accounts are unable to destroy the system by mistake, so it is
	generally best to use normal user accounts whenever possible,
	unless extra privilege is required.</para>

      <para>Always double and triple-check any commands issued as the
	superuser, since an extra space or missing character can mean
	irreparable data loss.</para>

      <para>Always create a user account for the system administrator
	and use this account to log in to the system for general
	usage.  This applies equally to multi-user or single-user
	systems.  Later sections will discuss how to create additional
	accounts and how to change between the normal user and
	superuser.</para>

      </indexterm>
      <para>System accounts are used to run services such as DNS,
	mail, and web servers.  The reason for this is security; if

      </indexterm>
      <para><username>nobody</username> is the generic unprivileged

	<secondary>user</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>User accounts are the primary means of access for real
	people to the system.  User accounts insulate the user and
	the environment, preventing users from damaging the system
	or other users, and allowing users to customize their
	environment without affecting others.</para>

      <para>Every person accessing the system should have a unique
	user account.  This allows the administrator to find out who
	is doing what, prevents users from clobbering each others'
	settings or reading each others' mail, and so forth.</para>

      <para>Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate
	their use of the system, by using alternate shells, editors,
	key bindings, and language.</para>

      in &man.login.conf.5;.  Each user account is assigned to a login
      class, <literal>default</literal> by default, and each login
      class has a set of login capabilities associated with it.  A
      login capability is a
      <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>
      pair, where <replaceable>name</replaceable> is a well-known
      identifier and <replaceable>value</replaceable> is an arbitrary
      string which is processed accordingly depending on the
      <replaceable>name</replaceable>.  Setting up login classes and
      capabilities is rather straightforward and is also described in
      &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>&os; does not normally read the configuration in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> directly, but instead
	reads the <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> database
	which provides faster lookups.  Whenever
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> is edited, the
	<filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> must be updated by
	executing the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Resource limits differ from the default login capabilities
      in two ways.  First, for every limit, there is a soft (current)
      and hard limit.  A soft limit may be adjusted by the user or
      application, but may not be set higher than the hard limit.  The
      hard limit may be lowered by the user, but can only be raised
      by the superuser.  Second, most resource limits apply per
      process to a specific user, not to the user as a whole.  These
      differences are mandated by the specific handling of the limits,
      not by the implementation of the login capability
      framework.</para>

    <para>Below are the most commonly used resource limits.  The rest
      of the limits, along with all the other login capabilities, can
      be found in &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

	<para>Processes started at system startup by
	  <filename>/etc/rc</filename> are assigned to the
	  <literal>daemon</literal> login class.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Although the <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> that
	  comes with the system is a good source of reasonable values
	  for most limits, they may not be appropriate for every
	  system.  Setting a limit too high may open the system up to
	  abuse, while setting it too low may put a strain on
	  productivity.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Users of <application>&xorg;</application> should
	  probably be granted more resources than other users.
	  <application>&xorg;</application> by itself takes a lot of
	  resources, but it also encourages users to run more programs
	  simultaneously.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Many limits apply to individual processes, not the user
	  as a whole.  For example, setting
	  <varname>openfiles</varname> to 50 means that each process
	  the user runs may open up to 50 files.  The total amount
	  of files a user may open is the value of
	  <literal>openfiles</literal> multiplied by the value of
	  <literal>maxproc</literal>.  This also applies to memory
	  consumption.</para>

      <secondary>groups</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>A group is a list of users.  A group is identified by its
      group name and <acronym>GID</acronym>.  In &os;, the
      kernel uses the <acronym>UID</acronym> of a process, and the
      list of groups it belongs to, to determine what the process is
      allowed to do.  Most of the time, the <acronym>GID</acronym> of
      a user or process usually means the first group in the
      list.</para>

    <para>The group name to <acronym>GID</acronym> mapping is listed
      in <filename>/etc/group</filename>.  This is a plain text file
      with four colon-delimited fields.  The first field is the group
      name, the second is the encrypted password, the third the
      <acronym>GID</acronym>, and the fourth the comma-delimited list
      of members.  For a more complete description of the syntax,
      refer to &man.group.5;.</para>

    <para>The superuser can modify <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      using a text editor.  Alternatively, &man.pw.8; can be used to
      add and edit groups.  For example, to add a group called
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> and then confirm that it
      exists:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupadd teamtwo</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, <literal>1100</literal> is the
      <acronym>GID</acronym> of <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.  Right
      now, <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> has no members.  This
      command will add <username>jru</username> as a member of
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding User Accounts to a New Group Using
	&man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod teamtwo -M jru</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The argument to <option>-M</option> is a comma-delimited
      list of users to be added to a new (empty) group or to replace
      the members of an existing group.  To the user, this group
      membership is different from (and in addition to) the user's
      primary group listed in the password file.  This means that
      the user will not show up as a member when using
      <option>groupshow</option> with &man.pw.8;, but will show up
      when the information is queried via &man.id.1; or a similar
      tool.  When &man.pw.8; is used to add a user to a group, it only
      manipulates <filename>/etc/group</filename> and does not attempt
      to read additional data from
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a New Member to a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod teamtwo -m db</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru,db</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, the argument to <option>-m</option> is a
      comma-delimited list of users who are to be added to the group.
      Unlike the previous example, these users are appended to the
      group list and do not replace the list of existing users in the
      group.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using &man.id.1; to Determine Group Membership</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>id jru</userinput>
uid=1001(jru) gid=1001(jru) groups=1001(jru), 1100(teamtwo)</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, <username>jru</username> is a member of the
      groups <groupname>jru</groupname> and
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <para>For more information about this command and the format of

    <title>Becoming Superuser</title>

    <para>There are several ways to do things as the superuser.  The
      worst way is to log in as <username>root</username> directly.
      Usually very little activity requires <username>root</username>
      so logging off and logging in as <username>root</username>,
      performing tasks, then logging off and on again as a normal user
      is a waste of time.</para>

    <para>A better way is to use &man.su.1; without providing a login
      but using <literal>-</literal> to inherit the root environment.
      Not providing a login will imply super user.  For this to work
      the login that must be in the <groupname>wheel</groupname> group.
      An example of a typical software installation would involve the
      administrator unpacking the software as a normal user and then
      elevating their privileges for the build and installation of
      the software.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Install a Program As The Superuser</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>configure</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>su -</userinput>
Password:
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>
&prompt.user;</screen>
    </example>

    <para>Note in this example the transition to
      <username>root</username> is less painful than logging off
      and back on twice.</para>

    <para>Using &man.su.1; works well for single systems or small
      networks with just one system administrator.  For more complex
      environments (or even for these simple environments)
      <command>sudo</command> should be used.  It is provided as a port,
      <filename role="package">security/sudo</filename>.  It allows for
      things like activity logging, granting users the ability to only
      run certain commands as the superuser, and several other
      options.</para>

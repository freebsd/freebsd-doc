    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>&os; allows multiple users to use the computer at the same
      time.  While only one user can sit in front of the screen and
      use the keyboard at any one time, any number of users can log
      in to the system through the network.  To use the system, each
      user should have their own user account.</para>

    <title>Account Types</title>

    <para>Since all access to the &os; system is achieved using accounts
      and all processes are run by users, user and account management
      is important.</para>

    <para>There are three main types of accounts:
      system accounts,
      user accounts, and the
      superuser account.</para>

      <title>System Accounts</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary>system</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>System accounts are used to run services such as DNS,
	mail, and web servers.  The reason for this is security; if
	all services ran as the superuser, they could act without
	restriction.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary><username>operator</username></secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Examples of system accounts are
	<username>daemon</username>, <username>operator</username>,
	<username>bind</username>, <username>news</username>, and
	<username>www</username>.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary><username>nobody</username></secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para><username>nobody</username> is the generic unprivileged
	system account.  However, the more services that use
	<username>nobody</username>, the more files and processes that
	user will become associated with, and hence the more
	privileged that user becomes.</para>

      <title>User Accounts</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary>user</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>User accounts are
	assigned to real people and are used to log in and use the
	system.  Every person accessing the system should have a unique
	user account.  This allows the administrator to find out who
	is doing what and prevents users from clobbering the
	settings of other users.</para>

      <para>Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate
	their use of the system, by configuring their default shell, editor,
	key bindings, and language settings.</para>
     <para>Every user account on a &os; system has certain information
      associated with it:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>User name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name is typed at the <prompt>login:</prompt>
	    prompt.  User names must be unique on the system as no two
	    users can have the same user name.  There are a number of
	    rules for creating valid user names which are documented in
	    &man.passwd.5;.  It is recommended to use user names that consist of eight or
	    fewer, all lower case characters in order to maintain
	    backwards compatibility with applications.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Each user account should have an associated password.  While the
	    password can be blank, this is highly discouraged.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User ID (<acronym>UID</acronym>)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The User ID (<acronym>UID</acronym>) is a number
	    used to uniquely identify the user to the
	    &os; system.  Commands that
	    allow a user name to be specified will first convert it to
	    the <acronym>UID</acronym>.  It is recommended to use a UID of
	    65535 or lower as higher UIDs may cause compatibility
	    issues with software that does not support integers larger
	    than 32-bits.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Group ID (<acronym>GID</acronym>)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The Group ID (<acronym>GID</acronym>) is a number used to uniquely identify
	    the primary group that the user belongs to.  Groups are a
	    mechanism for controlling access to resources based on a
	    user's <acronym>GID</acronym> rather than their
	    <acronym>UID</acronym>.  This can significantly reduce the
	    size of some configuration files and allows users to be
	    members of more than one group.  It is recommended to use a GID of
	    65535 or lower as higher GIDs may break some
	    software.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Login class</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Login classes are an extension to the group mechanism
	    that provide additional flexibility when tailoring the
	    system to different users.  Login classes are discussed
	    further in <xref linkend="users-limiting"/></para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password change time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default, &os; does not force users to change their
	    passwords periodically.  Password expiration can be
	    enforced on a per-user basis using &man.pw.8;, forcing some or all users to
	    change their passwords after a certain amount of time has
	    elapsed.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Account expiry time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default, &os; does not expire accounts.  When
	    creating accounts that need a limited lifespan, such as
	    student accounts in a school, specify the account expiry
	    date using &man.pw.8;.  After the expiry time has elapsed, the account
	    cannot be used to log in to the system, although the
	    account's directories and files will remain.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User's full name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name uniquely identifies the account to &os;,
	    but does not necessarily reflect the user's real name.
	    Similar to a comment, this information
	    can contain a space, uppercase characters, and be more
	    than 8 characters long.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Home directory</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The home directory is the full path to a directory on
	    the system.  This is the user's starting directory when
	    the user logs in.  A common convention is to put all user
	    home directories under <filename
	      class="directory">/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>
	    or <filename
	      class="directory">/usr/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>.
	    Each user stores their personal files and subdirectories
	    in their own home directory.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User shell</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The shell provides the user's default environment for
	    interacting with the system.  There are many different
	    kinds of shells and experienced users will have their own
	    preferences, which can be reflected in their account
	    settings.</para>

      <title>The Superuser Account</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>accounts</primary>
	<secondary>superuser (root)</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The superuser account, usually called
	<username>root</username>, is used to
	manage the system with no limitations on privileges.  For this
	reason, it should not be used for day-to-day
	tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of
	the system, or programming.</para>

      <para>The superuser, unlike other user
	accounts, can operate without limits, and misuse of the
	superuser account may result in spectacular disasters.  User
	accounts are unable to destroy the operating system by mistake, so it is
	recommended to login as a user account and to only become the superuser
	when a command requires extra privilege.</para>

      <para>Always double and triple-check any commands issued as the
	superuser, since an extra space or missing character can mean
	irreparable data loss.</para>

      <para>There are several ways to become gain superuser privilege.  While one
      can log in as <username>root</username>, this is highly discouraged.</para>

    <para>Instead, use &man.su.1; to become the superuser.  If
      <literal>-</literal> is specified when running this command, the user will also inherit the root user's environment.
      The user running this command must
      be in the <groupname>wheel</groupname> group or else the command
      will fail.  The user must also know the password for the
      <username>root</username> user account.</para>

      <para>In this example, the user only becomes superuser in order to run
      <command>make install</command> as this step requires superuser privilege.
      Once the command completes, the user types <command>exit</command>
      to leave the superuser account and return to the privilege of
      their user account.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Install a Program As The Superuser</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>configure</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>su -</userinput>
Password:
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>
&prompt.user;</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The built-in &man.su.1; framework works well for single systems or small
      networks with just one system administrator.  An alternative
      is to install the
      <filename role="package">security/sudo</filename> package or port.  This software
      provides activity logging and allows the administrator to configure which users
      can run which commands
      as the superuser.</para>

    <para>Login classes are defined in
      <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> and are described in detail
      in &man.login.conf.5;.  Each user account is assigned to a login
      class, <literal>default</literal> by default, and each login
      class has a set of login capabilities associated with it.  A
      login capability is a
      <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>
      pair, where <replaceable>name</replaceable> is a well-known
      identifier and <replaceable>value</replaceable> is an arbitrary
      string which is processed accordingly depending on the
      <replaceable>name</replaceable>.  Setting up login classes and
      capabilities is rather straightforward and is also described in
      &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>&os; does not normally read the configuration in
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> directly, but instead
	reads the <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> database
	which provides faster lookups.  Whenever
	<filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> is edited, the
	<filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> must be updated by
	executing the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Resource limits differ from the default login capabilities
      in two ways.  First, for every limit, there is a soft (current)
      and hard limit.  A soft limit may be adjusted by the user or
      application, but may not be set higher than the hard limit.  The
      hard limit may be lowered by the user, but can only be raised
      by the superuser.  Second, most resource limits apply per
      process to a specific user, not to the user as a whole.  These
      differences are mandated by the specific handling of the limits,
      not by the implementation of the login capability
      framework.</para>

    <para>Below are the most commonly used resource limits.  The rest
      of the limits, along with all the other login capabilities, can
      be found in &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

	    as <literal>filesize</literal>, or disk quotas.
	    This limit is often used as a less-severe method of
	    controlling disk space consumption.  Since users do not
	    generate core files themselves, and often do not delete
	    them, setting this may save them from running out of disk
	    space should a large program crash.</para>

    <para>There are a few other things to remember when setting
      resource limits.  Following are some general tips, suggestions,
      and miscellaneous comments.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Processes started at system startup by
	  <filename>/etc/rc</filename> are assigned to the
	  <literal>daemon</literal> login class.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Although the <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> that
	  comes with the system is a good source of reasonable values
	  for most limits, they may not be appropriate for every
	  system.  Setting a limit too high may open the system up to
	  abuse, while setting it too low may put a strain on
	  productivity.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Users of <application>&xorg;</application> should
	  probably be granted more resources than other users.
	  <application>&xorg;</application> by itself takes a lot of
	  resources, but it also encourages users to run more programs
	  simultaneously.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Many limits apply to individual processes, not the user
	  as a whole.  For example, setting
	  <varname>openfiles</varname> to 50 means that each process
	  the user runs may open up to 50 files.  The total amount
	  of files a user may open is the value of
	  <literal>openfiles</literal> multiplied by the value of
	  <literal>maxproc</literal>.  This also applies to memory
	  consumption.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>For further information on resource limits and login classes
      and capabilities in general, refer to &man.cap.mkdb.1;,
      &man.getrlimit.2;, and &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>accounts</primary>
      <secondary>groups</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>A group is a list of users.  A group is identified by its
      group name and <acronym>GID</acronym>.  In &os;, the
      kernel uses the <acronym>UID</acronym> of a process, and the
      list of groups it belongs to, to determine what the process is
      allowed to do.  Most of the time, the <acronym>GID</acronym> of
      a user or process usually means the first group in the
      list.</para>

    <para>The group name to <acronym>GID</acronym> mapping is listed
      in <filename>/etc/group</filename>.  This is a plain text file
      with four colon-delimited fields.  The first field is the group
      name, the second is the encrypted password, the third the
      <acronym>GID</acronym>, and the fourth the comma-delimited list
      of members.  For a more complete description of the syntax,
      refer to &man.group.5;.</para>

    <para>The superuser can modify <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      using a text editor.  Alternatively, &man.pw.8; can be used to
      add and edit groups.  For example, to add a group called
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> and then confirm that it
      exists:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupadd teamtwo</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, <literal>1100</literal> is the
      <acronym>GID</acronym> of <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.  Right
      now, <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> has no members.  This
      command will add <username>jru</username> as a member of
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding User Accounts to a New Group Using
	&man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod teamtwo -M jru</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The argument to <option>-M</option> is a comma-delimited
      list of users to be added to a new (empty) group or to replace
      the members of an existing group.  To the user, this group
      membership is different from (and in addition to) the user's
      primary group listed in the password file.  This means that
      the user will not show up as a member when using
      <option>groupshow</option> with &man.pw.8;, but will show up
      when the information is queried via &man.id.1; or a similar
      tool.  When &man.pw.8; is used to add a user to a group, it only
      manipulates <filename>/etc/group</filename> and does not attempt
      to read additional data from
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a New Member to a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod teamtwo -m db</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru,db</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, the argument to <option>-m</option> is a
      comma-delimited list of users who are to be added to the group.
      Unlike the previous example, these users are appended to the
      group list and do not replace the list of existing users in the
      group.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using &man.id.1; to Determine Group Membership</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>id jru</userinput>
uid=1001(jru) gid=1001(jru) groups=1001(jru), 1100(teamtwo)</screen>
    </example>

    <para>In this example, <username>jru</username> is a member of the
      groups <groupname>jru</groupname> and
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <para>For more information about this command and the format of
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>, refer to &man.pw.8; and

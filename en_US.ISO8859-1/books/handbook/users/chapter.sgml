    <title>Synopsis</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.nbm; February 2000</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <para>All access to the system is achieved via accounts, and all
      processes are run by users, so user and account management are
      of integral importance on FreeBSD systems.</para>

    <para>There are three main types of accounts; the <link
	linkend="users-superuser">Superuser</link>, <link
	linkend="users-system">system users</link>, and <link
	linkend="users-user">user accounts</link>.  The Superuser
      account, usually called <username>root</username>, is used to
      manage the system with no limitations on privileges.  System
      users run services.  Finally, user accounts are used by real
      people, who log on, read mail, and so forth.</para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="users-superuser">
    <title>The Superuser Account</title>
    
    <para>The superuser account, usually called
      <username>root</username>, comes preconfigured, and facilitates
      system administration, and should not be used for day-to-day
      tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of
      the system, or programming.</para>
      
    <para>This is because the superuser, unlike normal user accounts,
      can operate without limits, and misuse of the superuser account
      may result in spectacular disasters.  User accounts are unable
      to destroy the system by mistake, so it is generally best to use
      normal user accounts whenever possible, unless you especially
      need the extra privilege.</para>

    <para>In addition, always double and triple-check commands you
      issue as the superuser, since an extra space or missing
      character can mean irreparable data loss.  Those extra
      privileges you needed when you decided to change to the
      superuser mean that the safeguards of your normal user account
      no longer apply.</para>

    <para>So, the first thing you should do after reading this
      chapter, is to create an unprivileged user account for yourself
      for general usage, if you haven't already.  This applies equally
      whether you're running a multi-user or single-user machine.
      Later in this chapter, we discuss how to create additional
      accounts, and how to change between the normal user and
      superuser.</para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="users-system">
    <title>System Accounts</title>

    <para>System users are those used to run services such as DNS,
      mail, web servers, and so forth.  The reason for this is
      security; if all services ran as the superuser, they could
      act without restriction.</para>

    <para>Examples of system users are <username>daemon</username>,
      <username>operator</username>, <username>bind</username> (for
      the Domain Name Service), and <username>news</username>.  Often
      sysadmins create <username>httpd</username> to run web servers
      they install.</para>

    <para><username>nobody</username> is the generic unprivileged
      system user, but the more services that use
      <username>nobody</username>, the more privileged it
      becomes.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="users-user">
    <title>User Accounts</title>

    <para>User accounts are the primary means of access for real
      people to the system, and these accounts insulate the user and
      the environment, preventing the users from damaging the system
      or other users, and allowing users to customize their
      environment without affecting others.</para>

    <para>Every person accessing your system should have their own
      unique user account.  This allows you to find out who is doing
      what, and prevent people from clobbering each others' settings,
      and reading mail meant for the other, and so forth.</para>

    <para>Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate
      their use of the system, by using alternate shells, editors, key
      bindings, and language.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="users-modifying">
    <title>Modifying Accounts</title>

    <para><application>pw</application> is a powerful and flexible
      means to modify accounts, but <application>adduser</application>
      is recommended for creating new accounts, and
      <application>rmuser</application> for deleting accounts.</para>

    <para><application>chpass</application> allows both the system
      administrator and normal users to adjust passwords, shells, and
      personal information.  <application>passwd</application> is the
      more common means to change passwords specifically,
      however.</para>


    <sect2 id="users-adduser">
      <title>adduser</title>

      <para><application>adduser</application> is a simple program for
	adding new users.  It creates <filename>passwd</filename> and
	<filename>group</filename> entries for the user, as well as
	creating their home directory, copy in some default dotfiles
	from <filename>/usr/share/skel</filename>, and can optionally
	mail the user a welcome message.</para>

      <para>To create the initial configuration file, use
	<command>adduser -s -config_create</command>.
	<footnote>
	  <para>The <option>-s</option> makes adduser default to
	    quiet.  We use <option>-v</option> later when we want to
	    change defaults.</para>
	</footnote>Next, we configure adduser defaults, and create our
	first user account, since using root for normal usage is evil
	and nasty.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Changing the configuration for adduser</title>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>adduser -v</userinput>
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.
Check /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group
Enter your default shell: csh date no sh tcsh [sh]: <userinput>tcsh</userinput>
Your default shell is: tcsh -> /usr/local/bin/tcsh
Enter your default HOME partition: [/home]:
Copy dotfiles from: /usr/share/skel no [/usr/share/skel]: 
Send message from file: /etc/adduser.message no 
[/etc/adduser.message]: <userinput>no</userinput>
Do not send message
Use passwords (y/n) [y]: <userinput>y</userinput>

Write your changes to /etc/adduser.conf? (y/n) [n]: <userinput>y</userinput>

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. I will give you the chance later to correct any input.
Enter username [a-z0-9_-]: <userinput>jru</userinput>

&prompt.root;</screen>
      </example>

      <para>In summary, we changed the default shell to
	<application>tcsh</application> (an additional shell found in
	packages), and turned off the sending of a welcome mail to
	added users.  We then saved the configuration, and then
	created an account for <username>jru</username>, and we made
	sure <username>jru</username> is in <username>wheel</username>
	group (which we'll see is important later).</para>

      <note>
	<para>The password you type in isn't echoed, nor are asterisks
	  displayed.  Make sure you don't mistype the password twice
	  :-)</para>
      </note>

      <note>
	<para>Just use <command>adduser</command> without arguments
	  from now on, and you won't have to go through changing the
	  defaults.  If the program asks you to change the defaults,
	  exit the program, and try the <option>-s</option>
	  option.</para>

  <sect1 id="users-limiting">
    <title>Limiting Users</title>

    <para>If you run a multi-user system, chances are that you do not trust
      all of your users not to damage your system.  FreeBSD provides a
      number of ways a system administrator can limit the amount of system
      resources an individual user can use.  These limits are generally
      divided into two sections: disk quotas, and other resources
      limits.</para>

    <para>Disk quotas are a way for the system administrator to tell the
      filesystem the amount of disk space a user may use; moreover, they
      provide a way to quickly check on the disk usage of a user without
      having to calculate it every time.  Quotas are discussed in <xref
      linkend="quotas">.</para>

    <para>The other resource limits include ways to limit the amount of
      CPU, memory, and other resources a user may consume.  These are
      defined using login classes and are discussed here.</para>

    <para>Login classes are defined in
      <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.  The precise semantics are
      beyond the scope of this section, but are described in detail in the
      &man.login.conf.5; manual page.  It is sufficient to say that each
      user is assigned to a login class (<literal>default</literal> by
      default), and that each login class has a set of login capabilities
      associated with it.  A login capability is a
      <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>
      pair, where <replaceable>name</replaceable> is a well-known
      identifier and <replaceable>value</replaceable> is an arbitrary
      string processed accordingly depending on the name.  Setting up login
      classes and capabilities is rather straight-forward, and is also
      described in &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>Resource limits are different from plain vanilla login
      capabilities in two ways.  First, for every limit, there is a soft
      (current) and hard limit.  A soft limit may be adjusted by the user
      or application, but may be no higher than the hard limit.  The latter
      may be lowered by the user, but never raised.  Second, most resource
      limits apply per process to a specific user, not the user as a whole.
      Note, however, that these differences are mandated by the specific
      handling of the limits, not by the implementation of the login
      capability framework (i.e., they are not <emphasis>really</emphasis>
      a special case of login capabilities).</para>

    <para>And so, without further ado, below are the most commonly used
      resource limits (the rest, along with all the other login
      capabilities, may be found in &man.login.conf.5;).</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>coredumpsize</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The limit on the size of a core file generated by a program
	  is, for obvious reasons, subordinate to other limits on disk
	  usage (e.g., <literal>filesize</literal>, or disk quotas).
	  Nevertheless, it is often used as a less-severe method of
	  controlling disk space consumption: since users do not generate
	  core files themselves, and often do not delete them, setting this
	  may save them from running out of disk space should a large
	  program (e.g., Emacs) crash.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>cputime</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum amount of CPU time a user's process may
	    consume.  Offending processes will be killed by the kernel.

	    <note>
	      <para>This is a limit on CPU <emphasis>time</emphasis>
	        consumed, not percentage of the CPU as displayed in some
	        fields by &man.top.1; and &man.ps.1;.  A limit on the
	        latter is, at the time of this writing, not possible, and
	        would be rather useless: a compiler&mdash;probably a
	        legitimate task&mdash;can easily use almost 100% of a CPU
	        for some time.</para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>filesize</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum size of a file the user may possess.

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum number of processes a user may be

	    alike.  For obvious reasons, this may not be larger than the
	    system limit specified by the <literal>kern.maxproc</literal>
	    sysctl.  Also note that setting this too small may hinder a
	    user's productivity: it is often useful to be logged in
	    multiple times or execute pipelines.  Some tasks, such as
	    compiling a large program, also spawn multiple processes (e.g.,
	    &man.make.1;, &man.cc.1;, and other intermediate

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum amount a memory a process may have
	    requested to be locked into main memory (e.g., see
	    &man.mlock.2;).  Some system-critical programs, such as

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum amount of memory a process may consume

	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>openfiles</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum amount of files a process may have
	    open.  In FreeBSD, files are also used to represent sockets and
	    IPC channels; thus, be careful not to set this too low.  The
	    system-wide limit for this is defined by the
	    <literal>kern.maxfiles</literal> sysctl.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>sbsize</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the limit on the amount of network memory, and thus
	    mbufs, a user may consume.  This originated as a response to an
	    old DoS attack by creating a lot of sockets, but can be
	    generally used to limit network communications.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>stacksize</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the maximum size a process' stack may grow to.
	    This alone is not sufficient to limit the amount of memory a
	    program may use; consequently, it should be used in conjunction
	    with other limits.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>There are a few other things to remember when setting resource
      limits.  Following are some general tips, suggestions, and
      miscellaneous comments.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Processes started at system startup by
          <filename>/etc/rc</filename> are assigned to the
          <literal>daemon</literal> login class.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Although the <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> that comes
          with the system is a good source of reasonable values for most
          limits, only you, the administrator, can know what is appropriate
          for your system.  Setting a limit too high may open your system
          up to abuse, while setting it too low may put a strain on
          productivity.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Users of the X Window System (X11) should probably be granted
	  more resources than other users.  X11 by itself takes a lot of
	  resources, but it also encourages users to run more programs
	  simultaneously.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remember that many limits apply to individual processes, not
          the user as a whole.  For example, setting openfiles to 50 means
          that each process the user runs may open up to 50 files.  Thus,
          the gross amount of files a user may open is the value of
          <literal>openfiles</literal> multiplied by the value of
          <literal>maxproc</literal>.  This also applies to memory
          consumption.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

      capabilities in general, please consult the relevant manual pages:

    <title>Personalizing Users</title>

    <para>Localization is an environment set up by the system
      administrator or user to accommodate different languages,
      character sets, date and time standards, and so on.  This is
      discussed in the <link linkend="l10n">localization</link>
      chapter.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="users-groups">
    <title>Groups</title>

    <para>A group is simply a list of users.  Groups are identified by
      their group name and gid (group ID).  In FreeBSD (and most other Unix
      systems), the two factors the kernel uses to decide whether a process
      is allowed to do something is its user ID and list of groups it
      belongs to.  Unlike a user ID, a process has a list of groups
      associated with it.  You may hear some things refer to the "group ID"
      of a user or process; most of the time, this just means the first
      group in the list.</para>

    <para>The group name to group ID map is in
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>.  This is a plain text file with four
      colon-delimited fields.  The first fields is the group name, the
      second is the encrypted password, the third the group ID, and the
      fourth the comma-delimited list of members.  It can safely be edited
      by hand (assuming, of course, that you don't make any syntax
      errors!).  For a more complete description of the syntax, see the
      &man.group.5; manual page.</para>

    <para>If you don't want to edit <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      manually, you can use the &man.pw.8; command to add and edit groups.
      For example, to add a group called <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> and
      then confirm that it exists you can use:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a group using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><command>pw</command> groupadd <groupname>teamtwo</groupname></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><command>pw</command> groupshow <groupname>teamtwo</groupname></userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The number <literal>1100</literal> above is the group ID of the
      group <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.  Right now,
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> has no members, and is thus rather
      useless.  Let's change that by inviting <username>jru</username> to
      the <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> group.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding somebody to a group using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><command>pw</command> groupmod <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> <option>-M</option> <username>jru</username></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><command>pw</command> groupshow <groupname>teamtwo</groupname></userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The argument to the <option>-M</option> option is a comma-delimited list
      of users who are members of the group.  If you've read the preceeding
      sections, you'll know that the password file also contains a group
      for each user; the group in the password file is automatically added
      to the group list by the system and will not (should not) appear in
      the list of members when using &man.pw.8; to query group membership.
      If you wish to find out what groups a user is part of, you can use
      the &man.id.1; program as so:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using &man.id.1; to determine group membership</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput><command>id</command> <username>jru</username></userinput>
uid=1001(jru) gid=1001(jru) groups=1001(jru), 1100(teamtwo)</screen>
    </example>

    <para>As you can see, <username>jru</username> is a member of the
      groups <groupname>jru</groupname> and
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <para>For more information about &man.pw.8;, see its manual page, and
      for more information on the format of
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>, consult the &man.group.5; manual
      page.</para>

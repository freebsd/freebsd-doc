    <title>Synopsis</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.nbm; February 2000</emphasis>.</para>
    
    <para>All access to the system is achieved via accounts, and all
      processes are run by users, so user and account management are
      of integral importance on FreeBSD systems.</para>

    <para>There are three main types of accounts; the <link
	linkend="users-superuser">Superuser</link>, <link
	linkend="users-system">system users</link>, and <link
	linkend="users-user">user accounts</link>.  The Superuser
      account, usually called <username>root</username>, is used to
      manage the system with no limitations on privileges.  System
      users run services.  Finally, user accounts are used by real
      people, who log on, read mail, and so forth.</para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="users-superuser">
    <title>The Superuser Account</title>
    
    <para>The superuser account, usually called
      <username>root</username>, comes preconfigured, and facilitates
      system administration, and should not be used for day-to-day
      tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of
      the system, or programming.</para>
      
    <para>This is because the superuser, unlike normal user accounts,
      can operate without limits, and misuse of the superuser account
      may result in spectacular disasters.  User accounts are unable
      to destroy the system by mistake, so it is generally best to use
      normal user accounts whenever possible, unless you especially
      need the extra privilege.</para>

    <para>In addition, always double and triple-check commands you
      issue as the superuser, since an extra space or missing
      character can mean irreparable data loss.  Those extra
      privileges you needed when you decided to change to the
      superuser mean that the safeguards of your normal user account
      no longer apply.</para>

    <para>So, the first thing you should do after reading this
      chapter, is to create an unprivileged user account for yourself
      for general usage, if you haven't already.  This applies equally
      whether you're running a multi-user or single-user machine.
      Later in this chapter, we discuss how to create additional
      accounts, and how to change between the normal user and
      superuser.</para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="users-system">
    <title>System Accounts</title>

    <para>System users are those used to run services such as DNS,
      mail, web servers, and so forth.  The reason for this is
      security; if all services ran as the superuser, they could
      act without restriction.</para>

    <para>Examples of system users are <username>daemon</username>,
      <username>operator</username>, <username>bind</username> (for
      the Domain Name Service), and <username>news</username>.  Often
      sysadmins create <username>httpd</username> to run web servers
      they install.</para>

    <para><username>nobody</username> is the generic unprivileged
      system user, but the more services that use
      <username>nobody</username>, the more privileged it
      becomes.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="users-user">
    <title>User Accounts</title>

    <para>User accounts are the primary means of access for real
      people to the system, and these accounts insulate the user and
      the environment, preventing the users from damaging the system
      or other users, and allowing users to customize their
      environment without affecting others.</para>

    <para>Every person accessing your system should have their own
      unique user account.  This allows you to find out who is doing
      what, and prevent people from clobbering each others' settings,
      and reading mail meant for the other, and so forth.</para>

    <para>Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate
      their use of the system, by using alternate shells, editors, key
      bindings, and language.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="users-modifying">
    <title>Modifying Accounts</title>

    <para><application>pw</application> is a powerful and flexible
      means to modify accounts, but <application>adduser</application>
      is recommended for creating new accounts, and
      <application>rmuser</application> for deleting accounts.</para>

    <para><application>chpass</application> allows both the system
      administrator and normal users to adjust passwords, shells, and
      personal information.  <application>passwd</application> is the
      more common means to change passwords specifically,
      however.</para>


    <sect2 id="users-adduser">
      <title>adduser</title>

      <para><application>adduser</application> is a simple program for
	adding new users.  It creates <filename>passwd</filename> and
	<filename>group</filename> entries for the user, as well as
	creating their home directory, copy in some default dotfiles
	from <filename>/usr/share/skel</filename>, and can optionally
	mail the user a welcome message.</para>

      <para>To create the initial configuration file, use
	<command>adduser -s -config_create</command>.
	<footnote>
	  <para>The <option>-s</option> makes adduser default to
	    quiet.  We use <option>-v</option> later when we want to
	    change defaults.</para>
	</footnote>Next, we configure adduser defaults, and create our
	first user account, since using root for normal usage is evil
	and nasty.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Changing the configuration for adduser</title>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>adduser -v</userinput>
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.
Check /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group
Enter your default shell: csh date no sh tcsh [sh]: <userinput>tcsh</userinput>
Your default shell is: tcsh -> /usr/local/bin/tcsh
Enter your default HOME partition: [/home]:
Copy dotfiles from: /usr/share/skel no [/usr/share/skel]: 
Send message from file: /etc/adduser.message no 
[/etc/adduser.message]: <userinput>no</userinput>
Do not send message
Use passwords (y/n) [y]: <userinput>y</userinput>

Write your changes to /etc/adduser.conf? (y/n) [n]: <userinput>y</userinput>

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. I will give you the chance later to correct any input.
Enter username [a-z0-9_-]: <userinput>jru</userinput>
Enter full name []: <userinput>J. Random User</userinput>
Enter shell csh date no sh tcsh [tcsh]: 
Enter home directory (full path) [/home/jru]: 
Uid [1001]: 
Enter login class: default []: 
Login group jru [jru]: 
Login group is ``jru''. Invite jru into other groups: guest no 
[no]: <userinput>wheel</userinput>
Enter password []: 
Enter password again []: 

Name:	  jru
Password: ****
Fullname: J. Random User

Copy files from /usr/share/skel to /home/jru
Add another user? (y/n) [y]: <userinput>n</userinput>
Goodbye!
&prompt.root;</screen>
      </example>

      <para>In summary, we changed the default shell to
	<application>tcsh</application> (an additional shell found in
	packages), and turned off the sending of a welcome mail to
	added users.  We then saved the configuration, and then
	created an account for <username>jru</username>, and we made
	sure <username>jru</username> is in <username>wheel</username>
	group (which we'll see is important later).</para>

      <note>
	<para>The password you type in isn't echoed, nor are asterisks
	  displayed.  Make sure you don't mistype the password twice
	  :-)</para>
      </note>

      <note>
	<para>Just use <command>adduser</command> without arguments
	  from now on, and you won't have to go through changing the
	  defaults.  If the program asks you to change the defaults,
	  exit the program, and try the <option>-s</option>
	  option.</para>

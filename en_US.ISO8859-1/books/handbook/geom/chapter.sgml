      control utilities which use the framework for configuration.
      This chapter will not go into in depth discussion on how GEOM
      handles or controls I/O, the underlying subsystem, or code.
      This information is provided through the &man.geom.4; manual
      page and its various SEE ALSO references.  This chapter is also
      not a definitive guide to <acronym>RAID</acronym>

    <para>Striping is a method used to combine several disk drives into
      a single volume.  In many cases, this is done through the use of
      hardware controllers.  The GEOM disk subsystem provides
      software support for <acronym>RAID</acronym>0, also known as
      disk striping.</para>

    <para>In a <acronym>RAID</acronym>0 system, data are split up in
      blocks that get written across all the drives in the array.
      Instead of having to wait on the system to write 256k to one
      disk, a <acronym>RAID</acronym>0 system can simultaneously write
      64k to each of four different disks, offering superior I/O
      performance.  This performance can be enhanced further by using
      multiple disk controllers.</para>

    <para>Each disk in a <acronym>RAID</acronym>0 stripe must be of
      the same size, since I/O requests are interleaved to read or
      write to multiple disks in parallel.</para>

    <procedure>
      <title>Creating a stripe of unformatted ATA disks</title>

      <step>
	<para>Load the <filename>geom_stripe.ko</filename>
	  module:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload geom_stripe</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Ensure that a suitable mount point exists.  If this
	  volume will become a root partition, then temporarily use
	  another mount point such as <filename
	    class="directory">/mnt</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /mnt</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Determine the device names for the disks which will
	  be striped, and create the new stripe device.  For example,
	  to stripe two unused and unpartitioned <acronym>ATA</acronym> disks,
	  for example <filename>/dev/ad2</filename> and
	  <filename>/dev/ad3</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gstripe label -v st0 /dev/ad2 /dev/ad3</userinput>
Metadata value stored on /dev/ad2.
Metadata value stored on /dev/ad3.
Done.</screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Write a standard label, also known as a partition
	  table, on the new volume and install the default
	  bootstrap code:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>bsdlabel -wB /dev/stripe/st0</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>This process should have created two other devices
	  in the <filename class="directory">/dev/stripe</filename>
	  directory in addition to the <devicename>st0</devicename> device.
	  Those include <devicename>st0a</devicename> and
	  <devicename>st0c</devicename>.  At this point a file system may be
	  created on the <devicename>st0a</devicename> device with the
	  <command>newfs</command> utility:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -U /dev/stripe/st0a</userinput></screen>

	<para>Many numbers will glide across the screen, and after a few
	  seconds, the process will be complete.  The volume has been
	  created and is ready to be mounted.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>To manually mount the created disk stripe:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/stripe/st0a /mnt</userinput></screen>

    <para>To mount this striped file system automatically during the boot
      process, place the volume information in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file.  For this purpose, a permanent
      mount point, named <filename class="directory">stripe</filename>, is
      created:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /stripe</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>echo "/dev/stripe/st0a /stripe ufs rw 2 2" \</userinput>
    <userinput>&gt;&gt; /etc/fstab</userinput></screen>

    <para>The <filename>geom_stripe.ko</filename> module must also be
      automatically loaded during system initialization, by adding a line to
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'geom_stripe_load="YES"' &gt;&gt; /boot/loader.conf</userinput></screen>

      <primary>Disk Mirroring</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Mirroring is a technology used by many corporations and home
      users to back up data without interruption.  When a mirror exists,
      it simply means that diskB replicates diskA.  Or, perhaps diskC+D
      replicates diskA+B.  Regardless of the disk configuration, the
      important aspect is that information on one disk or partition is
      being replicated.  Later, that information could be more easily
      restored, backed up without causing service or access
      interruption, and even be physically stored in a data safe.</para>

    <para>To begin, ensure the system has two disk drives of equal size,
      these exercises assume they are direct access (&man.da.4;)
      <acronym>SCSI</acronym> disks.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Mirroring Primary Disks</title>

      <para>Assuming &os; has been installed on the first,
	<devicename>da0</devicename> disk device, &man.gmirror.8;
	should be told to store its primary data there.</para>

      <para>Before building the mirror, enable additional debugging
	information and opening access to the device by setting the
	<varname>kern.geom.debugflags</varname> &man.sysctl.8; option
	to the following value:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl kern.geom.debugflags=17</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now create the mirror.  Begin the process by storing
	meta-data information on the primary disk device,
	effectively creating the
	<filename class="devicefile">/dev/mirror/gm</filename> device
	using the following command:</para>

      <warning>
	<para>Creating a mirror out of the boot drive may result in
	  data loss if any data has been stored on the last sector of
	  the disk.  This risk is reduced if creating the mirror is
	  done promptly after a fresh install of &os;.</para>
      </warning>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror label -vb round-robin gm0 /dev/da0</userinput></screen>

      <para>The system should respond with:</para>

      <screen>Metadata value stored on /dev/da0.
Done.</screen>

      <para>Initialize GEOM, this will load the
	<filename>/boot/kernel/geom_mirror.ko</filename> kernel
	module:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror load</userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>When this command completes successfully, it creates the
	  <devicename>gm0</devicename> device node under the
	  <filename class="directory">/dev/mirror</filename>
	  directory.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Enable loading of the <filename>geom_mirror.ko</filename>
	kernel module during system initialization:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'geom_mirror_load="YES"' &gt;&gt; /boot/loader.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>Edit the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file, replacing
	references to the old <devicename>da0</devicename> with the
	new device nodes of the <devicename>gm0</devicename> mirror
	device.</para>

      <note>
	<para>If &man.vi.1; is your preferred editor, the following is
	  an easy way to accomplish this task:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>vi /etc/fstab</userinput></screen>

	<para>In &man.vi.1; back up the current contents of
	  <filename>fstab</filename> by typing
	  <userinput>:w /etc/fstab.bak</userinput>.  Then
	  replace all old <devicename>da0</devicename> references
	  with <devicename>gm0</devicename> by typing
	  <userinput>:%s/da/mirror\/gm/g</userinput>.<para>
      </note>

      <para>The resulting <filename>fstab</filename> file should look
	similar to the following.  It does not matter if the disk
	drives are <acronym>SCSI</acronym> or <acronym>ATA</acronym>,
	the <acronym>RAID</acronym> device will be
	<devicename>gm</devicename> regardless.</para>

      <para>During system initialization, the
	<devicename>gm0</devicename> should be used in place of the
	<devicename>da0</devicename> device.  Once fully initialized,
	this may be checked by visually inspecting the output from
	the <command>mount</command> command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount</userinput>
Filesystem         1K-blocks    Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on

      <para>The output looks good, as expected.  Finally, to begin
	synchronization, insert the <devicename>da1</devicename> disk
	into the mirror using the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror insert gm0 /dev/da1</userinput></screen>

      <para>As the mirror is built the status may be checked using
	the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror status</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once the mirror has been built and all current data
	has been synchronized, the output from the above command
	should look like:</para>

      <screen>      Name    Status  Components
mirror/gm0  COMPLETE  da0
                      da1</screen>

      <para>If there are any issues, or the mirror is still

	<para>Reboot the machine using the power or reset button.  At

	<screen>OK? <userinput>load geom_mirror</userinput>
OK? <userinput>boot</userinput></screen>

	<para>If this works then for whatever reason the module was not

      <title>Recovering From Disk Failure</title>

      <para>The wonderful part about disk mirroring is that when a

	any data.</para>

      <para>Considering the previous <acronym>RAID</acronym>1
	configuration, assume that <devicename>da1</devicename>
	has failed and now needs to be replaced.  To replace it,
	determine which disk has failed and power down the system.
	At this point, the disk may be swapped with a new one and
	the system brought back up.  After the system has restarted,
	the following commands may be used to replace the disk:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror forget gm0</userinput></screen>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gmirror insert gm0 /dev/da1</userinput></screen>

    <title>GEOM Gate Network Devices</title>

    <para>GEOM supports the remote use of devices, such as disks,
      CD-ROMs, files, etc. through the use of the gate utilities.
      This is similar to <acronym>NFS</acronym>.</para>

    <para>To begin, an exports file must be created.  This file
      specifies who is permitted to access the exported resources and
      what level of access they are offered.  For example, to export
      the fourth slice on the first <acronym>SCSI</acronym> disk, the
      following <filename>/etc/gg.exports</filename> is more than
      adequate:</para>

    <programlisting>192.168.1.0/24 RW /dev/da0s4d</programlisting>

    <para>It will allow all hosts inside the private network access
      the file system on the <devicename>da0s4d</devicename>
      partition.</para>

    <para>To export this device, ensure it is not currently mounted,

      <primary>Disk Labels</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>During system initialization, the &os; kernel will create
      device nodes as devices are found.  This method of probing for
      devices raises some issues, for instance what if a new disk
      device is added via <acronym>USB</acronym>?  It is very likely
      that a flash device may be handed the device name of
      <devicename>da0</devicename> and the original
      <devicename>da0</devicename> shifted to
      <devicename>da1</devicename>.  This will cause issues mounting
      file systems if they are listed in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, effectively, this may also
      prevent the system from booting.</para>

    <para>One solution to this issue is to chain the
      <acronym>SCSI</acronym> devices in order so a new device added to
      the <acronym>SCSI</acronym> card will be issued unused device
      numbers.  But what about <acronym>USB</acronym> devices which may
      replace the primary <acronym>SCSI</acronym> disk?  This happens
      because <acronym>USB</acronym> devices are usually
      probed before the <acronym>SCSI</acronym> card.  One solution
      is to only insert these devices after the system has been
      booted.  Another method could be to use only a single
      <acronym>ATA</acronym> drive and never list the
      <acronym>SCSI</acronym> devices in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.</para>

    <para>A better solution is available.  By using the
      <command>glabel</command> utility, an administrator or user may
      label their disk devices and use these labels in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.  Because
      <command>glabel</command> stores the label in the last sector of
      a given provider, the label will remain persistent across reboots.
      By using this label as a device, the file system may always be
      mounted regardless of what device node it is accessed
      through.</para>

    <note>
      <para>This goes without saying that a label be permanent.  The
	<command>glabel</command> utility may be used to create both a
	transient and permanent label.  Only the permanent label will
	remain consistent across reboots.  See the &man.glabel.8;
	manual page for more information on the differences between
	labels.</para>
    </note>

    <sect2>
      <title>Label Types and Examples</title>

      <para>There are two types of labels, a generic label and a
	file system label.  Labels can be permanent or temporary.
	Permanent labels can be created with the &man.tunefs.8;
	or &man.newfs.8; commands.  They will then be created
	in a sub-directory of
	<filename class="directory">/dev</filename>, which will be named
	according to their file system type.  For example,
	<acronym>UFS</acronym>2 file system labels will be created in
	the <filename class="directory">/dev/ufs</filename>
	directory.  Permanent labels can also be created with the
	<command>glabel label</command> command.  These are not file system
	specific, and will be created in the <filename
	  class="directory">/dev/label</filename> directory.</para>

      <para>A temporary label will go away with the next reboot.  These
	labels will be created in the
	<filename class="directory">/dev/label</filename> directory and
	are perfect for experimentation.  A temporary label can be
	created using the <command>glabel create</command> command.  For more
	information, please read the manual page of &man.glabel.8;.</para>

<!-- XXXTR: How do you create a file system label without running newfs
            or when there is no newfs (e.g.: cd9660)? -->

      <para>To create a permanent label for a
	<acronym>UFS</acronym>2 file system without destroying any
	data, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>tunefs -L <replaceable>home</replaceable> <replaceable>/dev/da3</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <warning>
	<para>If the file system is full, this may cause data
	  corruption; however, if the file system is full then the
	  main goal should be removing stale files and not adding
	  labels.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>A label should now exist in
	<filename class="directory">/dev/ufs</filename> which may be
	added to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/ufs/home		/home            ufs     rw              2      2</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>The file system must not be mounted while attempting
	  to run <command>tunefs</command>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Now the file system may be mounted like normal:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /home</userinput></screen>

      <para>From this point on, so long as the
	<filename>geom_label.ko</filename> kernel module is loaded at
	boot with <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> or the
	<literal>GEOM_LABEL</literal> kernel option is present,
	the device node may change without any ill effect on the
	system.</para>

      <para>File systems may also be created with a default label
	by using the <option>-L</option> flag with
	<command>newfs</command>.  See the &man.newfs.8; manual page
	for more information.</para>

      <para>The following command can be used to destroy the
	label:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel destroy home</userinput></screen>

      <para>The following example shows how to label the partitions of a
	boot disk.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Labeling Partitions on the Boot Disk</title>

	<para>By permanently labeling the partitions on the boot disk,
	  the system should be able to continue to boot normally, even
	  if the disk is moved to another controller or transferred
	  to a different system.  For this example, it is assumed that a
	  single <acronym>ATA</acronym> disk is used, which is currently
	  recognized by the system as <devicename>ad0</devicename>.  It is
	  also assumed that the standard &os; partition scheme is used, with
	  <filename class="directory">/</filename>,
	  <filename class="directory">/var</filename>,
	  <filename class="directory">/usr</filename> and
	  <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> file systems, as well
	  as a swap partition.</para>

	<para>Reboot the system, and at the &man.loader.8; prompt, press
	  <keycap>4</keycap> to boot into single user mode.  Then enter the
	  following commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel label rootfs /dev/ad0s1a</userinput>
GEOM_LABEL: Label for provider /dev/ad0s1a is label/rootfs
&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel label var /dev/ad0s1d</userinput>
GEOM_LABEL: Label for provider /dev/ad0s1d is label/var
&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel label usr /dev/ad0s1f</userinput>
GEOM_LABEL: Label for provider /dev/ad0s1f is label/usr
&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel label tmp /dev/ad0s1e</userinput>
GEOM_LABEL: Label for provider /dev/ad0s1e is label/tmp
&prompt.root; <userinput>glabel label swap /dev/ad0s1b</userinput>
GEOM_LABEL: Label for provider /dev/ad0s1b is label/swap
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput></screen>

	<para>The system will continue with multi-user boot.  After the boot
	  completes, edit <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and replace the
	  conventional device names, with their respective labels.  The
	  final <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file will look like the
	  following:</para>

	<programlisting># Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
/dev/label/swap         none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/label/rootfs       /               ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/label/tmp          /tmp            ufs     rw              2       2
/dev/label/usr          /usr            ufs     rw              2       2
/dev/label/var          /var            ufs     rw              2       2</programlisting>

	<para>The system can now be rebooted.  If everything went well, it
	  will come up normally and <command>mount</command> will show:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount</userinput>
/dev/label/rootfs on / (ufs, local)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local)
/dev/label/tmp on /tmp (ufs, local, soft-updates)
/dev/label/usr on /usr (ufs, local, soft-updates)
/dev/label/var on /var (ufs, local, soft-updates)</screen>
      </example>

      <para>Starting with &os;&nbsp;7.2, the &man.glabel.8; class supports
	a new label type for <acronym>UFS</acronym> file systems, based on
	the unique file system id, <literal>ufsid</literal>.  These labels may
	be found in the <filename class="directory">/dev/ufsid</filename>
	directory and are created automatically during system startup.  It is
	possible to use <literal>ufsid</literal> labels to mount partitions
	using the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> facility.  Use the
	<command>glabel status</command> command to receive a list of
	file systems and their corresponding <literal>ufsid</literal>
	labels:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>glabel status</userinput>
                  Name  Status  Components
ufsid/486b6fc38d330916     N/A  ad4s1d
ufsid/486b6fc16926168e     N/A  ad4s1f</screen>

      <para>In the above example <devicename>ad4s1d</devicename>
	represents the <filename class="directory">/var</filename>
	file system, while <devicename>ad4s1f</devicename> represents the
	<filename class="directory">/usr</filename> file system.  Using the
	<literal>ufsid</literal> values shown, these partitions
	may now be mounted with the following entries in
	<filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/ufsid/486b6fc38d330916        /var        ufs        rw        2      2
/dev/ufsid/486b6fc16926168e        /usr        ufs        rw        2      2</programlisting>

      <para>Any partitions with <literal>ufsid</literal> labels can be
	mounted in this way, eliminating the need to create permanent
	labels for them manually, while still enjoying the benefits of
	device-name independent mounting.</para>

    <title>UFS Journaling Through GEOM</title>

      <primary>GEOM</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Journaling</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>With the release of &os; 7.0, the long awaited feature
      of journals has been implemented.  The implementation itself is
      provided through the <acronym>GEOM</acronym> subsystem and is
      easily configured via the &man.gjournal.8; utility.</para>

    <para>What is journaling?  Journaling capability stores a log of
      file system transactions, i.e.: changes that make up a complete
      disk write operation, before meta-data and file writes are
      committed to the disk proper.  This transaction log can later
      be replayed to redo file system transactions, preventing file
      system inconsistencies.</para>

    <para>This method is yet another mechanism to protect against data
      loss and inconsistencies of the file system.  Unlike Soft Updates
      which tracks and enforces meta-data updates and Snapshots which
      is an image of the file system, an actual log is stored in disk
      space specifically reserved for this task, and in some cases may be
      stored on another disk entirely.</para>

    <para>Unlike other file system journaling implementations, the
      <command>gjournal</command> method is block based and not
      implemented as part of the file system - only as a
      <acronym>GEOM</acronym> extension.</para>

    <para>To enable support for <command>gjournal</command>, the
      &os; kernel must have the following option - which is the
      default on &os; 7.0 and later systems:</para>

    <programlisting>options	UFS_GJOURNAL</programlisting>

    <para>If journaled volumes need to be mounted during startup, the
      <filename>geom_journal.ko</filename> kernel module will also have to be
      loaded, by adding the following line in
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>geom_journal_load="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>Alternatively, this function can also be built into a custom
      kernel, by adding the following line in the kernel configuration
      file:</para>

    <programlisting>options	GEOM_JOURNAL</programlisting>

    <para>Creating a journal on a free file system may now be done
      using the following steps, considering that the
      <devicename>da4</devicename> is a new <acronym>SCSI</acronym>
      disk:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gjournal load</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>gjournal label /dev/da4</userinput></screen>

    <para>At this point, there should be a
      <devicename>/dev/da4</devicename> device node and a
      <devicename>/dev/da4.journal</devicename> device node.
      A file system may now be created on this device:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -O 2 -J /dev/da4.journal</userinput></screen>

    <para>The previously issued command will create a
      <acronym>UFS</acronym>2 file system on the journaled device.</para>

    <para>Effectively <command>mount</command> the device at the
      desired point with:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/da4.journal <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>In the case of several slices, a journal will be created
	for each individual slice.  For instance, if
	<devicename>ad4s1</devicename> and <devicename>ad4s2</devicename>
	are both slices, then <command>gjournal</command> will create
	<devicename>ad4s1.journal</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad4s2.journal</devicename>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>For better performance, keeping the journal on another disk
      may be desired.  For these cases, the journal provider or storage
      device should be listed after the device to enable journaling
      on.  Journaling may also be enabled on current file systems by
      using <command>tunefs</command>; however, always make a backup
      before attempting to alter a file system.  In most cases, the
      <command>gjournal</command> will fail if it is unable to create
      the actual journal but this does not protect against data loss
      incurred as a result of misusing <command>tunefs</command>.</para>

    <para>It is also possible to journal the boot disk of a &os; system.

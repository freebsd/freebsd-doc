    <para>The process of starting a computer and loading the operating
      system is referred to as <quote>the bootstrap process</quote>,
      or simply <quote>booting</quote>.  &os;'s boot process provides
      a great deal of flexibility in customizing what happens when
      the system starts, including the ability to select from
      different operating systems installed on the same computer,
      different versions of the same operating system, or a different
      installed kernel.</para>

    <para>This chapter details the configuration options that can
      be set.  It demonstrates how to customize the &os; boot
      process, including everything that happens until the &os; kernel
      has started, probed for devices, and started &man.init.8;.  This
      occurs when the text color of the boot messages changes from
      bright white to grey.</para>

    <title>The Booting Problem</title>

    <para>Turning on a computer and starting the operating system
      poses an interesting dilemma.  By definition, the computer does
      not know how to do anything until the operating system is
      started.  This includes running programs from the disk.  If
      the computer can not run a program from the disk without the
      operating system, and the operating system programs are on the
      disk, how is the operating system started?</para>

    <para>This problem parallels one in the book <citetitle>The
	Adventures of Baron Munchausen</citetitle>.  A character had
      fallen part way down a manhole, and pulled himself out by
      grabbing his bootstraps, and lifting.  In the early days of
      computing the term <firstterm>bootstrap</firstterm> was applied
      to the mechanism used to load the operating system, which has
      become shortened to <quote>booting</quote>.</para>

    </indexterm>

    <para>On x86 hardware the Basic Input/Output System
      (<acronym>BIOS</acronym>) is responsible for loading the
      operating system.  To do this, the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
      looks on the hard disk for the Master Boot Record
      (<acronym>MBR</acronym>), which must be located in a specific
      place on the disk.  The <acronym>BIOS</acronym> has enough
      knowledge to load and run the <acronym>MBR</acronym>, and
      assumes that the <acronym>MBR</acronym> can then carry out the
      rest of the tasks involved in loading the operating system,
      possibly with the help of the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.</para>

	<acronym>MBR</acronym>)</primary></indexterm>

    <indexterm><primary>Boot Manager</primary></indexterm>

    <indexterm><primary>Boot Loader</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The code within the <acronym>MBR</acronym> is usually
      referred to as a <emphasis>boot manager</emphasis>, especially
      when it interacts with the user.  In this case, the boot
      manager usually has more code in the first
      <emphasis>track</emphasis> of the disk or within the file
      system of some operating systems.  A boot manager is sometimes
      also called a <emphasis>boot loader</emphasis>, but &os; uses
      that term for a later stage of booting.  Popular boot managers
      include <application>boot0</application>, also called
      <application>Boot Easy</application>, the standard &os; boot
      manager, <application>Grub</application>,
      <application>GAG</application>, and
      <application>LILO</application>.  Only
      <application>boot0</application> fits within the
      <acronym>MBR</acronym>.</para>

    <para>If only one operating system is installed, a standard PC
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> will suffice.  This
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> searches for the first bootable (active)
      slice on the disk, and then runs the code on that slice to load
      the remainder of the operating system.  By default, the
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> installed by &man.fdisk.8; is such an
      <acronym>MBR</acronym> and is based on
      <filename>/boot/mbr</filename>.</para>

    <para>If multiple operating systems are present, a different boot
      manager can be installed which displays the list of operating
      systems so that the user can choose which one to boot from.  Two
      boot managers are discussed in the next subsection.</para>

    <para>The remainder of the &os; bootstrap system is divided
      into three stages.  The first stage is run by the
      <acronym>MBR</acronym>, which knows just enough to get the
      computer into a specific state and run the second stage.  The
      second stage can do a little bit more, before running the
      third stage.  The third stage finishes the task of loading the
      operating system.  The work is split into three stages because
      PC standards put limits on the size of the programs that can
      be run at stages one and two.  Chaining the tasks together
      allows &os; to provide a more flexible loader.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>kernel</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>&man.init.8;</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The kernel is then started and it begins to probe for
      devices and initialize them for use.  Once the kernel boot
      process is finished, the kernel passes control to the user
      process &man.init.8;, which then makes sure the disks are in a
      usable state.  &man.init.8; then starts the user-level resource
      configuration which mounts file systems, sets up network cards
      to communicate on the network, and starts the processes which
      have been configured to run on a &os; system at startup.</para>

      <para>The code in the <acronym>MBR</acronym> or boot manager is
	sometimes referred to as <emphasis>stage zero</emphasis> of
	the boot process.  This section discusses two boot managers:
	<application>boot0</application> and
	<application>LILO</application>.</para>

      <formalpara>
	<title>The <application>boot0</application> Boot
	  Manager:</title>

	<para>The <acronym>MBR</acronym> installed by &os;'s installer
	  or &man.boot0cfg.8; is based on
	  <filename>/boot/boot0</filename>.  The size and capability
	  of <application>boot0</application> is restricted to 446
	  bytes due to the slice table and <literal>0x55AA</literal>
	  identifier at the end of the <acronym>MBR</acronym>.  If
	  <application>boot0</application> and multiple operating
	  systems are installed, a message similar to this example
	  will be displayed at boot time:</para>
      </formalpara>

	<title><filename>boot0</filename> Screenshot</title>

	<screen>F1 Win
F2 FreeBSD

Default: F2</screen>
      </example>

      <para>Other operating systems, in particular &windows;, will
	overwrite an existing <acronym>MBR</acronym> if they are
	installed after &os;.  If this happens, or to replace the
	existing <acronym>MBR</acronym> with the &os;
	<acronym>MBR</acronym>, use the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdisk -B -b /boot/boot0 <replaceable>device</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>where <replaceable>device</replaceable> is the boot disk,
	such as <devicename>ad0</devicename> for the first
	<acronym>IDE</acronym> disk, <devicename>ad2</devicename>
	for the first <acronym>IDE</acronym> disk on a second
	<acronym>IDE</acronym> controller, or
	<devicename>da0</devicename>
	for the first <acronym>SCSI</acronym> disk.  To create a
	custom configuration of the <acronym>MBR</acronym>, refer to
	&man.boot0cfg.8;.</para>

      <formalpara>
	<title>The LILO Boot Manager:</title>

	<para>To install this boot manager so it will also boot
	  &os;, boot into Linux and add the following to the existing
	  <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename> configuration:</para>
      </formalpara>

      <programlisting>other=/dev/hdXY
table=/dev/hdX
loader=/boot/chain.b
label=FreeBSD</programlisting>

      <para>Specify &os;'s primary partition and drive using Linux
	specifiers, replacing <replaceable>X</replaceable> with the
	Linux drive letter and <replaceable>Y</replaceable> with the
	Linux primary partition number.  For a <acronym>SCSI</acronym>
	drive, change <replaceable>/dev/hd</replaceable> to
	<replaceable>/dev/sd</replaceable>.  The
	<option>loader=/boot/chain.b</option> line can be omitted if
	both operating systems are installed on the same drive.  Next,
	run <command>/sbin/lilo&nbsp;-v</command> to commit the new
	changes.  Verify these are correct by checking the screen
	messages.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="boot-boot1">
      <title>Stage One, <filename>/boot/boot1</filename>, and Stage
	Two, <filename>/boot/boot2</filename></title>

      <para>Conceptually, the first and second stages are part of the
	same program, on the same area of the disk.  Because of space
	constraints, they have been split into two, but are always
	installed together.  They are copied from the combined
	<filename>/boot/boot</filename> by the installer or
	&man.bsdlabel.8;.</para>

      <para>They are located outside file systems, in the first track
	of the boot slice, starting with the first sector.  This is
	where boot0 (<xref linkend="boot-boot0"/>), or any other
	boot manager, expects to find a program to run which will
	continue the boot process.  The number of sectors used is
	easily determined from the size of
	<filename>/boot/boot</filename>.</para>

      <para><filename>boot1</filename> is very simple, since it can
	only be 512 bytes in size, and knows just enough about the
	&os; <firstterm>bsdlabel</firstterm>, which stores
	information about the slice, to find and execute
	<filename>boot2</filename>.</para>

      <para><filename>boot2</filename> is slightly more sophisticated,
	and understands the &os; file system enough to find files, and
	can provide a simple interface to choose the kernel or loader
	to run.</para>

      <para>However, &man.loader.8; is much more sophisticated and
	provides a boot configuration which is run by
	<filename>boot2</filename>.</para>

	disk.</para>

      <warning>
	<title>Dangerously Dedicated Mode</title>

	<para>If just the disk name is used, such as
	  <devicename>ad0</devicename>, &man.bsdlabel.8; will create a
	    <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk, without slices.
	  This is probably not the desired action, so double check the
	  <replaceable>diskslice</replaceable> passed to
	  &man.bsdlabel.8; before pressing

    <sect2 id="boot-loader">
      <title>Stage Three, <filename>/boot/loader</filename></title>

      <indexterm><primary>boot-loader</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The loader is the final stage of the three-stage
	bootstrap, and is located on the file system, usually as
	<filename>/boot/loader</filename>.</para>

      <para>The loader is intended as an interactive method for
	configuration, using a built-in command set, backed up by a
	more powerful interpreter which has a more complex command
	set.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot-loader-flow">
	<title>Loader Program Flow</title>

	<para>During initialization, the loader will probe for a
	  console and for disks, and figure out which disk it is
	  booting from.  It will set variables accordingly, and an
	  interpreter is started where user commands can be passed
	  from a script or interactively.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>loader</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>loader configuration</primary></indexterm>

	<para>The loader will then read
	  <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>, which by default reads
	  in <filename>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</filename> which
	  sets reasonable defaults for variables and reads
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> for local changes to
	  those variables.  <filename>loader.rc</filename> then acts
	  on these variables, loading whichever modules and kernel are
	  selected.</para>

	<para>Finally, by default, the loader issues a 10 second wait
	  for key presses, and boots the kernel if it is not
	  interrupted. If interrupted, the user is presented with a
	  prompt which understands the command set, where the user may
	  adjust variables, unload all modules, load modules, and then
	  finally boot or reboot.</para>

	<title>Boot Time Splash Screens</title>

	<para>The splash screen creates an alternate boot screen.  The
	  splash screen hides all the boot probe messages and service
	  startup messages before displaying either a command line or
	  graphical login prompt.</para>

	<para>There are two basic environments available in &os;.  The
	  first is the default legacy virtual console command line
	  environment.  After the system finishes booting, a console
	  login prompt is presented.  The second environment is the
	  graphical environment as described in <xref linkend="x11"/>.
	  Refer to that chapter for more information on how to install
	  and configure a graphical display manager and a graphical
	  login manager.</para>

	<sect4 id="boot-splash-function">
	  <title>Splash Screen Function</title>

	  <para>The splash screen function supports 256-colors in the
	    bitmap (<filename>.bmp</filename>), ZSoft
	    <acronym>PCX</acronym> (<filename>.pcx</filename>), or
	    TheDraw (<filename>.bin</filename>) formats.  The splash
	    image files must have a resolution of 320 by 200 pixels or
	    less in order to work on standard VGA adapters.</para>

	  <para>To use larger images, up to the maximum resolution of
	    1024 by 768 pixels, load the <acronym>VESA</acronym>
	    module during system boot.  For a custom kernel, as
	    described in <xref linkend="kernelconfig"/>, include the
	    <literal>VESA</literal> kernel configuration option.
	    Loading <acronym>VESA</acronym> support provides the
	    ability to display a splash screen image that fills the
	    whole display screen.</para>

	  <para>While the splash screen is being displayed during the
	    booting process, it can be turned off any time by hitting
	    any key on the keyboard.</para>

	  <para>The splash screen also defaults to being a screen
	    saver outside.  After a time period of non-use, the splash
	    screen will be displayed and will cycle through steps of
	    changing intensity of the image, from bright to very dark
	    and over again.  The configuration of the splash screen
	    saver can be overridden by adding a
	    <literal>saver=</literal> line to
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Several built-in
	    screen savers are available and described in
	    &man.splash.4;.  The <literal>saver=</literal> option only
	    applies to virtual consoles and has no effect on graphical
	    display managers.</para>

	  <para>A few boot loader messages, including the boot options
	    menu and a timed wait count down prompt, are displayed at
	    boot time, even when the splash screen is enabled.</para>

    <title>Device Hints</title>

      <primary>device.hints</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>During initial system startup, the boot &man.loader.8; reads
      &man.device.hints.5;.  This file stores kernel boot information
      known as variables, sometimes referred to as
      <quote>device hints</quote>.  These <quote>device hints</quote>
      are used by device drivers for device configuration.</para>

    <para>Device hints may also be specified at the Stage 3 boot
      loader prompt, as demonstrated in <xref
	linkend="boot-loader"/>.
      Variables can be added using <command>set</command>, removed
      with <command>unset</command>, and viewed
      <command>show</command>.  Variables set in
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> can also be overridden.
      Device hints entered at the boot loader are not permanent and
      will not be applied on the next reboot.</para>

    <para>Once the system is booted, &man.kenv.1; can be used to dump
      all of the variables.</para>

    <para>The syntax for <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>
      is one variable per line, using the hash
      <quote>#</quote> as comment markers.  Lines are constructed as
      follows:</para>

    <screen><userinput>hint.driver.unit.keyword="<replaceable>value</replaceable>"</userinput></screen>

    <para>The syntax for the Stage 3 boot loader is:</para>

    <screen><userinput>set hint.driver.unit.keyword=<replaceable>value</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>where <literal>driver</literal> is the device driver name,
      <literal>unit</literal> is the device driver unit number, and
      <literal>keyword</literal> is the hint keyword.  The keyword may
      consist of the following options:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>at</literal>: specifies the bus which the
	  device is attached to.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>port</literal>: specifies the start address of
	  the <acronym>I/O</acronym> to be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>irq</literal>: specifies the interrupt request
	  number to be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>drq</literal>: specifies the DMA channel
	  number.</para>

	  address occupied by the device.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>flags</literal>: sets various flag bits for the
	  device.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>disabled</literal>: if set to
	  <literal>1</literal> the device is disabled.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Since device drivers may accept or require more hints not
      listed here, viewing a driver's manual page is recommended.
      For more information, refer to &man.device.hints.5;,

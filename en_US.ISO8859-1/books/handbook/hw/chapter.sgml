  <title>PC Hardware compatibility</title>
  
  <para>Issues of hardware compatibility are among the most troublesome in the
    computer industry today and FreeBSD is by no means immune to trouble.  In
    this respect, FreeBSD's advantage of being able to run on inexpensive
    commodity PC hardware is also its liability when it comes to support for
    the amazing variety of components on the market.  While it would be
    impossible to provide a exhaustive listing of hardware that FreeBSD
    supports, this section serves as a catalog of the device drivers included
    with FreeBSD and the hardware each drivers supports. Where possible and
    appropriate, notes about specific products are included.  You may also
    want to refer to <link linkend="kernelconfig-config">the kernel
      configuration file</link> section in this handbook for a list of
    supported devices.</para>
      
  <para>As FreeBSD is a volunteer project without a funded testing department,
    we depend on you, the user, for much of the information contained in this
    catalog.  If you have direct experience of hardware that does or does not
    work with FreeBSD, please let us know by sending e-mail to the &a.doc;.
    Questions about supported hardware should be directed to the &a.questions;
    (see <link linkend="eresources-mail">Mailing Lists</link> for more
    information).  When submitting information or asking a question, please
    remember to specify exactly what version of FreeBSD you are using and
    include as many details of your hardware as possible.</para>
      
  <sect1>
    <title>Resources on the Internet</title>
    
    <para>The following links have proven useful in selecting hardware. Though
      some of what you see won't necessarily be specific (or even applicable)
      to FreeBSD, most of the hardware information out there is OS
      independent.  Please check with the FreeBSD hardware guide to make sure
      that your chosen configuration is supported before making any
      purchases.</para>

    <para>The following list of sample hardware configurations by no means
      constitutes an endorsement of a given hardware vendor or product by

      <para>I have had fairly good luck building workstation and server
	configurations with the following components.  I can't guarantee that
	you will too, nor that any of the companies here will remain
	&ldquo;best buys&rdquo; forever.  I will try, when I can, to keep this
	list up-to-date but cannot obviously guarantee that it will be at any
	given time.</para>

	<title>Motherboards</title>
	
	<para>For Pentium Pro (P6) systems, I'm quite fond of the <ulink
	    url="http://www.tyan.com/html/products.html">Tyan</ulink> S1668
	  dual-processor motherboard as well as the Intel PR440FX motherboard
	  with on-board SCSI WIDE and 100/10MB Intel Etherexpress NIC.  You
	  can build a dandy little single or dual processor system (which is
	  supported in FreeBSD 3.0) for very little cost now that the Pentium
	  Pro 180/256K chips have fallen so greatly in price, but no telling
	  how much longer this will last.</para>
	    
	<para>For the Pentium II, I'm rather partial to the <ulink
	    url="http://www.asus.com.tw/">ASUS</ulink> <ulink
	    url="http://www.asus.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Pentiumpro/P2l97-s/index.html">P2l97-S</ulink>
	  motherboard with the on-board Adaptec SCSI WIDE controller.</para>
	    
	<para>For Pentium machines, the ASUS <ulink
	    url="http://www.asus.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Pentium/P55tp4/index.html">P55T2P4</ulink>
	  motherboard appears to be a good choice for mid-to-high range
	  Pentium server and workstation systems.</para>
	
	<para>Those wishing to build more fault-tolerant systems should also
	  be sure to use Parity memory or, for truly 24/7 applications, ECC
	  memory.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>ECC memory does involve a slight performance trade-off (which
	    may or may not be noticeable depending on your application) but
	    buys you significantly increased fault-tolerance to memory
	    errors.</para>

	<title>Disk Controllers</title>
	    
	<para>This one is a bit trickier, and while I used to recommend the
	  <ulink url="http://www.buslogic.com/">Buslogic</ulink> controllers
	  unilaterally for everything from ISA to PCI, now I tend to lean
	  towards the <ulink url="http://www.adaptec.com/">Adaptec</ulink>
	  1542CF for ISA, Buslogic Bt747c for EISA and Adaptec 2940UW for
	  PCI.</para>
	    
	<para>The NCR/Symbios cards for PCI have also worked well for me,
	  though you need to make sure that your motherboard supports the
	  BIOS-less model if you're using one of those (if your card has
	  nothing which looks even vaguely like a ROM chip on it, you've
	  probably got one which expects its BIOS to be on your
	  motherboard).</para>
	    
	<para>If you should find that you need more than one SCSI controller
	  in a PCI machine, you may wish to consider conserving your scarce
	  PCI bus resources by buying the Adaptec 3940 card, which puts two
	  SCSI controllers (and internal busses) in a single slot.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>There are two types of 3940 on the market&mdash;the older
	    model with AIC 7880 chips on it, and the newer one with AIC 7895
	    chips.  The newer model requires <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/development/cam/">CAM</ulink>
	    support which is not yet part of FreeBSD&mdash;you have to add it,
	    or install from one of the CAM binary snapshot release.</para>

	<title>Disk drives</title>
	
	<para>In this particular game of Russian roulette, I'll make few
	  specific recommendations except to say &ldquo;SCSI over IDE whenever
	  you can afford it.&rdquo; Even in small desktop configurations, SCSI
	  often makes more sense since it allows you to easily migrate drives
	  from server to desktop as falling drive prices make it economical to
	  do so.  If you have more than one machine to administer then think
	  of it not simply as storage, think of it as a food chain! For a
	  serious server configuration, there's not even any
	  argument&mdash;use SCSI equipment and good cables.</para>

	<title>CDROM drives</title>
	
	<para>My SCSI preferences extend to SCSI CDROM drives as well, and
	  while the <ulink url="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba</ulink> drives
	  have always been favourites of mine (in whatever speed is hot that
	  week), I'm still fond of my good old <ulink

	  only a 12 speed, but it's offered excellent performance and
	  reliability.</para>
	    
	<para>Generally speaking, most SCSI CDROM drives I've seen have been
	  of pretty solid construction and you probably won't go wrong with an
	  HP or NEC SCSI CDROM drive either.  SCSI CDROM prices also appear to
	  have dropped considerably in the last few months and are now quite
	  competitive with IDE CDROMs while remaining a technically superior
	  solution.  I now see no reason whatsoever to settle for an IDE CDROM
	  drive if given a choice between the two.</para>

	<title>CD Recordable (WORM) drives</title>
	
	<para>At the time of this writing, FreeBSD supports 3 types of CDR
	  drives (though I believe they all ultimately come from Phillips
	  anyway): The Phillips CDD 522 (Acts like a Plasmon), the PLASMON
	  RF4100 and the HP 6020i.  I myself use the HP 6020i for burning
	  CDROMs (in 2.2 and alter releases&mdash;it does not work with
	  earlier releases of the SCSI code) and it works very well.  See
	  <ulink
	    url="file:/usr/share/examples/worm">/usr/share/examples/worm</ulink>
	  on your 2.2 system for example scripts used to created ISO9660
	  filesystem images (with RockRidge extensions) and burn them onto an
	  HP6020i CDR.</para>

	<para>For backup purposes, I'd have to give the higher recommendation

	    url="http://www.smc.com/">SMC</ulink> Ultra 16 controller for any
	  ISA application and the SMC EtherPower or Compex ENET32 cards for
	  slightly cheaper PCI based networking.  In general, any PCI NIC
	  based around DEC's DC21041 Ethernet controller chip, such as the
	  Znyx ZX342 or DEC DE435/450, will generally work quite well and can
	  frequently be found in 2-port and 4-port version (useful for

	    url="http://www.etinc.com/">Emerging Technologies</ulink> also

	<para>Multiport card options are somewhat more numerous, though it has

	  probably the tightest, primarily as a result of that company's
	  commitment to making sure that we are adequately supplied with

	<title>The UART: What it is and how it works</title>
	
	<para><emphasis>Copyright &copy; 1996 &a.uhclem;, All Rights
	    Reserved.  13 January 1996.</emphasis></para>
	
	<para>The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
	  controller is the key component of the serial communications
	  subsystem of a computer.  The UART takes bytes of data and transmits
	  the individual bits in a sequential fashion.  At the destination, a
	  second UART re-assembles the bits into complete bytes.</para>
	    
	<para>Serial transmission is commonly used with modems and for
	  non-networked communication between computers, terminals and other
	  devices.</para>
	    
	<para>There are two primary forms of serial transmission: Synchronous
	  and Asynchronous.  Depending on the modes that are supported by the
	  hardware, the name of the communication sub-system will usually
	  include a <literal>A</literal> if it supports Asynchronous
	  communications, and a <literal>S</literal> if it supports
	  Synchronous communications.  Both forms are described below.</para>
	    
	<para>Some common acronyms are:
	  
	  <blockquote>
	    <para>UART	Universal Asynchronous
	      Receiver/Transmitter</para>
	  </blockquote>
	  
	  <blockquote>
	    <para>USART	Universal Synchronous-Asynchronous
	      Receiver/Transmitter</para>
	  </blockquote></para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Synchronous Serial Transmission</title>
	  
	  <para>Synchronous serial transmission requires that the sender and
	    receiver share a clock with one another, or that the sender
	    provide a strobe or other timing signal so that the receiver knows
	    when to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the next bit of the data.  In most
	    forms of serial Synchronous communication, if there is no data
	    available at a given instant to transmit, a fill character must be
	    sent instead so that data is always being transmitted.
	    Synchronous communication is usually more efficient because only
	    data bits are transmitted between sender and receiver, and
	    synchronous communication can be more more costly if extra wiring
	    and circuits are required to share a clock signal between the
	    sender and receiver.</para>
	      
	  <para>A form of Synchronous transmission is used with printers and
	    fixed disk devices in that the data is sent on one set of wires
	    while a clock or strobe is sent on a different wire. Printers and
	    fixed disk devices are not normally serial devices because most
	    fixed disk interface standards send an entire word of data for
	    each clock or strobe signal by using a separate wire for each bit
	    of the word.  In the PC industry, these are known as Parallel
	    devices.</para>
	      
	  <para>The standard serial communications hardware in the PC does not
	    support Synchronous operations.  This mode is described here for
	    comparison purposes only.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Asynchronous Serial Transmission</title>
	  
	  <para>Asynchronous transmission allows data to be transmitted
	    without the sender having to send a clock signal to the receiver.
	    Instead, the sender and receiver must agree on timing parameters
	    in advance and special bits are added to each word which are used
	    to synchronize the sending and receiving units.</para>
	      
	  <para>When a word is given to the UART for Asynchronous
	    transmissions, a bit called the "Start Bit" is added to the
	    beginning of each word  that is to be transmitted.  The Start Bit
	    is used to alert the receiver that a word of data is about to be
	    sent, and to force the clock in the receiver into synchronization
	    with the clock in the transmitter.  These two clocks must be
	    accurate enough to not  have the frequency drift by more than 10%
	    during the transmission of the remaining bits in the word.  (This
	    requirement was set in the days of mechanical teleprinters and is
	    easily met by modern electronic equipment.)</para>
	      
	  <para>After the Start Bit, the individual bits of the word of data
	    are sent, with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) being sent first.
	    Each  bit in the transmission is transmitted for exactly the same
	    amount of time as all of the other bits, and the receiver
	    &ldquo;looks&rdquo; at the wire at approximately halfway through
	    the period assigned to each bit to determine if the bit is a
	    <literal>1</literal> or a <literal>0</literal>.  For example, if
	    it takes two seconds to send each bit, the receiver will examine
	    the signal to determine if it is a <literal>1</literal> or a
	    <literal>0</literal> after one second has passed, then it will
	    wait two seconds and then examine the value of the next bit, and
	    so on.</para>
	      
	  <para>The sender does not know when the receiver has
	    &ldquo;looked&rdquo; at the value of the bit.  The sender only
	    knows when the clock says to begin transmitting the next bit of
	    the word.</para>
	      
	  <para>When the entire data word has been sent, the transmitter may
	    add a Parity Bit that the transmitter generates.  The Parity Bit
	    may be used by the receiver to perform simple error checking.
	    Then at least one Stop Bit is sent by the transmitter.</para>
	      
	  <para>When the receiver has received all of the bits in the data
	    word, it may check for the Parity Bits (both sender and receiver
	    must agree on whether a Parity Bit is to be used), and then the
	    receiver looks for a Stop Bit.  If the Stop Bit does not appear
	    when it is supposed to, the UART considers the entire word to be
	    garbled and will report a Framing Error to the host processor when
	    the data word is read.  The usual cause of a Framing Error is that
	    the sender and receiver clocks were not running at the same speed,
	    or that the signal was interrupted.</para>
	      
	  <para>Regardless of whether the data was received correctly or not,
	    the UART automatically discards the Start, Parity and Stop bits.
	    If the sender and receiver are configured identically, these bits
	    are not passed to the host.</para>
	      
	  <para>If another word is ready for transmission, the Start Bit for
	    the new word can be sent as soon as the Stop Bit for the previous
	    word has been sent.</para>
	      
	  <para>Because asynchronous data is &ldquo;self synchronizing&rdquo;,
	    if there is no data to transmit, the transmission line can be
	    idle.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Other UART Functions</title>
	  
	  <para>In addition to the basic job of converting data from parallel
	    to serial for transmission and from serial to parallel on
	    reception, a UART will usually provide additional circuits for
	    signals that can be used to indicate the state of the transmission
	    media, and to regulate the flow of data in the event that the
	    remote device is not prepared to accept more data.  For example,
	    when the  device connected to the UART is a modem, the modem may
	    report the presence of a carrier on the phone line while the
	    computer may be able to instruct the modem to reset itself or to
	    not take calls by asserting or deasserting one more more of these
	    extra signals. The function of each of these additional signals is
	    defined in the EIA RS232-C standard.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>The RS232-C and V.24 Standards</title>
	  
	  <para>In most computer systems, the UART is connected to circuitry
	    that generates signals that comply with the EIA RS232-C
	    specification.  There is also a CCITT standard named V.24 that
	    mirrors the specifications included in RS232-C.</para>
	      
	  <sect5>
	    <title>RS232-C Bit Assignments (Marks and Spaces)</title>
	    
	    <para>In RS232-C, a value of <literal>1</literal> is called a
	      <literal>Mark</literal> and a value of <literal>0</literal> is
	      called a <literal>Space</literal>.  When a communication line is
	      idle, the line is said to be &ldquo;Marking&rdquo;, or
	      transmitting continuous <literal>1</literal> values.</para>
		
	    <para>The Start bit always has a value of <literal>0</literal> (a
	      Space).  The Stop Bit always has a value of <literal>1</literal>
	      (a Mark).  This means that there will always be a Mark (1) to
	      Space (0) transition on the line at the start of every word,
	      even when multiple word are transmitted back to back.  This
	      guarantees that sender and receiver can resynchronize their
	      clocks regardless of the content of the data bits that are being
	      transmitted.</para>
		
	    <para>The idle time between Stop and Start bits does not have to
	      be an exact multiple (including zero) of the bit rate of the
	      communication link, but most UARTs are designed this way for
	      simplicity.</para>
		
	    <para>In RS232-C, the "Marking" signal (a <literal>1</literal>) is
	      represented by a voltage between -2 VDC and -12 VDC, and a
	      "Spacing" signal (a <literal>0</literal>) is represented by a
	      voltage between 0 and +12 VDC.  The transmitter is supposed to
	      send +12 VDC or -12 VDC, and the receiver is supposed to allow
	      for some voltage loss in long cables.  Some transmitters in low
	      power devices (like portable computers) sometimes use only +5
	      VDC and -5 VDC, but these values are still acceptable to a
	      RS232-C receiver, provided that the cable lengths are
	      short.</para>
	  </sect5>
	      
	  <sect5>
	    <title>RS232-C Break Signal</title>
	    
	    <para>RS232-C also specifies a signal called a
	      <literal>Break</literal>, which is caused by sending continuous
	      Spacing values (no Start or Stop bits).  When there is no
	      electricity present on the data circuit, the line is considered
	      to be sending <literal>Break</literal>.</para>
		
	    <para>The <literal>Break</literal> signal must be of a duration
	      longer than the time it takes to send a complete byte plus
	      Start, Stop and Parity bits.  Most UARTs can distinguish between
	      a Framing Error and a Break, but if the UART cannot do this, the
	      Framing Error detection can be used to identify Breaks.</para>
		
	    <para>In the days of teleprinters, when numerous printers around
	      the country were wired in series (such as news services), any
	      unit could cause a <literal>Break</literal> by temporarily
	      opening the entire circuit so that no current flowed.  This was
	      used to allow a location with urgent news to interrupt some
	      other location that was currently sending information.</para>
		
	    <para>In modern systems there are two types of Break signals. If
	      the Break is longer than 1.6 seconds, it is considered a "Modem
	      Break", and some modems can be programmed to terminate the
	      conversation and go on-hook or enter the modems' command mode
	      when the modem detects this signal.  If the Break is smaller
	      than 1.6 seconds, it signifies a Data Break and it is up to the
	      remote computer to respond to this signal.  Sometimes this form
	      of Break is used as an Attention or Interrupt signal and
	      sometimes is accepted as a substitute for the ASCII CONTROL-C
	      character.</para>
		
	    <para>Marks and Spaces are also equivalent to &ldquo;Holes&rdquo;
	      and &ldquo;No Holes&rdquo; in paper tape systems.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>Breaks cannot be generated from paper tape or from any
		other byte value, since bytes are always sent with Start and
		Stop bit.  The UART is usually capable of generating the
		continuous Spacing signal in response to a special command
		from the host processor.</para>
	    </note>
	  </sect5>
	  
	  <sect5>
	    <title>RS232-C DTE and DCE Devices</title>
	    
	    <para>The RS232-C specification defines two types of equipment:
	      the Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and the Data Carrier Equipment
	      (DCE).  Usually, the DTE device is the terminal (or computer),
	      and the DCE is a modem.  Across the phone line at the other end
	      of a conversation, the receiving modem is also a DCE device and
	      the computer that is connected to that modem is a DTE device.
	      The DCE device receives signals on the pins that the DTE device
	      transmits on, and vice versa.</para>
		
	    <para>When two devices that are both DTE or both DCE must be
	      connected together without a modem or a similar media translater
	      between them, a NULL modem must be used.  The NULL modem
	      electrically re-arranges the cabling so that the transmitter
	      output is connected to the receiver input on the other device,
	      and vice versa.  Similar translations are performed on all of
	      the control signals so that each device will see what it thinks
	      are DCE (or DTE) signals from the other device.</para>
		
	    <para>The number of signals generated by the DTE and DCE devices
	      are not symmetrical.  The DTE device generates fewer signals for
	      the DCE device than the DTE device receives from the DCE.</para>
	  </sect5>
	  
	  <sect5>
	    <title>RS232-C Pin Assignments</title>
	    
	    <para>The EIA RS232-C specification (and the ITU equivalent, V.24)
	      calls for a twenty-five pin connector (usually a DB25) and
	      defines the purpose of most of the pins in that
	      connector.</para>
		
	    <para>In the IBM Personal Computer and similar systems, a subset
	      of RS232-C signals are provided via nine pin connectors (DB9).
	      The signals that are not included on the PC connector deal
	      mainly with synchronous operation, and this transmission mode is
	      not supported by the UART that IBM selected for use in the IBM
	      PC.</para>
		
	    <para>Depending on the computer manufacturer, a DB25, a DB9, or
	      both types of connector may be used for RS232-C communications.
	      (The IBM PC also uses a DB25 connector for the parallel printer
	      interface which causes some confusion.)</para>
		
	    <para>Below is a table of the RS232-C signal assignments in the
	      DB25 and DB9 connectors.</para>

	  <title>Bits, Baud and Symbols</title>
	  
	  <para>Baud is a measurement of transmission speed in asynchronous
	    communication.  Because of advances in modem communication
	    technology, this term is frequently misused when describing the
	    data rates in newer devices.</para>
	      
	  <para>Traditionally, a Baud Rate represents the number of bits that
	    are actually being sent over the media, not the amount of data
	    that is actually moved from one DTE device to the other. The Baud
	    count includes the overhead bits Start, Stop and Parity that are
	    generated by the sending UART and removed by the receiving UART.
	    This means that seven-bit words of data actually take 10 bits to
	    be completely transmitted.  Therefore, a modem capable of moving
	    300 bits per second from one place to another can normally only
	    move 30 7-bit words if Parity is used and one Start and Stop bit
	    are present.</para>
	      
	  <para>If 8-bit data words are used and Parity bits are also used,
	    the data rate falls to 27.27 words per second, because it now
	    takes 11 bits to send the eight-bit words, and the modem still
	    only sends 300 bits per second.</para>
	      
	  <para>The formula for converting bytes per second into a baud rate
	    and vice versa was simple until error-correcting modems came
	    along.  These modems receive the serial stream of bits from the
	    UART in the host computer (even when internal modems are used the
	    data is still frequently serialized) and converts the bits back
	    into bytes.  These bytes are then combined into packets and sent
	    over the phone line using a Synchronous transmission method.  This
	    means that the Stop, Start, and Parity bits added by the UART in
	    the DTE (the computer) were removed by the modem before
	    transmission by the sending modem. When these bytes are received
	    by the remote modem, the remote modem adds Start, Stop and Parity
	    bits to the words, converts them to a serial format and then sends
	    them to the receiving UART in the remote computer, who then strips
	    the Start, Stop and Parity bits.</para>
	      
	  <para>The reason all these extra conversions are done is so that the
	    two modems can perform error correction, which means that the
	    receiving modem is able to ask the sending modem to resend a block
	    of data that was not received with the correct checksum.  This
	    checking is handled by the modems, and the DTE devices are usually
	    unaware that the process is occurring.</para>
	      
	  <para>By striping the Start, Stop and Parity bits, the additional
	    bits of data that the two modems must share between themselves to
	    perform error-correction are mostly concealed from the effective
	    transmission rate seen by the sending and receiving DTE equipment.
	    For example, if a modem sends ten 7-bit words to another modem
	    without including the Start, Stop and Parity bits, the sending
	    modem will be able to add 30 bits of its own information that the
	    receiving modem can use to do error-correction without impacting
	    the transmission speed of the real data.</para>
	      
	  <para>The use of the term Baud is further confused by modems that
	    perform compression.  A single 8-bit word passed over the
	    telephone line might represent a dozen words that were transmitted
	    to the sending modem.  The receiving modem will expand the data
	    back to its original content and pass that data to the receiving
	    DTE.</para>
	      
	  <para>Modern modems also include buffers that allow the rate that
	    bits move across the phone line (DCE to DCE) to be a different
	    speed than the speed that the bits move between the DTE and DCE on
	    both ends of the conversation.  Normally the speed between the DTE
	    and DCE is higher than the DCE to DCE speed because of the use of
	    compression by the modems.</para>
	      
	  <para>Because the number of bits needed to describe a byte varied
	    during the trip between the two machines plus the differing
	    bits-per-seconds speeds that are used present on the DTE-DCE and
	    DCE-DCE links, the usage of the term Baud to describe the overall
	    communication speed causes problems and can misrepresent the true
	    transmission speed.  So Bits Per Second (bps) is the correct term
	    to use to describe the transmission rate seen at the DCE to DCE
	    interface and Baud or Bits Per Second are acceptable terms to use
	    when a connection is made between two systems with a wired
	    connection, or if a modem is in use that is not performing
	    error-correction or compression.</para>
	      
	  <para>Modern high speed modems (2400, 9600, 14,400, and 19,200bps)
	    in reality still operate at or below 2400 baud, or more
	    accurately, 2400 Symbols per second.  High speed modem are able to
	    encode more bits of data into each Symbol using a technique called
	    Constellation Stuffing, which is why the effective bits per second
	    rate of the modem is higher, but the modem continues to operate
	    within the limited audio bandwidth that the telephone system
	    provides.  Modems operating at 28,800 and higher speeds have
	    variable Symbol rates, but the technique is the same.</para>

	    <title>The NS16550AF and the PC16550D are the same thing</title>
		
	    <para>National reorganized their part numbering system a few years
	      ago, and the NS16550AFN no longer exists by that name. (If you
	      have a NS16550AFN, look at the date code on the part, which is a
	      four digit number that usually starts with a nine.  The first
	      two digits of the number are the year, and the last two digits
	      are the week in that year when the part was packaged.  If you
	      have a NS16550AFN, it is probably a few years old.)</para>
		
	    <para>The new numbers are like PC16550DV, with minor differences
	      in the suffix letters depending on the package material and its
	      shape.  (A description of the numbering system can be found
	      below.)</para>
		
	    <para>It is important to understand that in some stores, you may
	      pay &#36;15(US) for a NS16550AFN made in 1990 and in the next
	      bin are the new PC16550DN parts with minor fixes that National
	      has made since the AFN part was in production, the PC16550DN was
	      probably made in the past six months and it costs half (as low
	      as &#36;5(US) in volume) as much as the NS16550AFN because they
	      are readily available.</para>
		
	    <para>As the supply of NS16550AFN chips continues to shrink, the
	      price will probably continue to increase until more people
	      discover and accept that the PC16550DN really has the same
	      function as the old part number.</para>

	  <title>Other Vendors and Similar UARTs</title>
	  
	  <para>Over the years, the 8250, 8250A, 16450 and 16550 have been
	    licensed or copied by other chip vendors.  In the case of the
	    8250, 8250A and 16450, the exact circuit (the
	    &ldquo;megacell&rdquo;) was licensed to many vendors, including
	    Western Digital and Intel. Other vendors reverse-engineered the
	    part or produced emulations that had similar behavior.</para>
	      
	  <para>In internal modems, the modem designer will frequently emulate
	    the 8250A/16450 with the modem microprocessor, and the emulated
	    UART will frequently have a hidden buffer consisting of several
	    hundred bytes.  Because of the size of the buffer, these
	    emulations can be as reliable as a 16550A in their ability to
	    handle high speed data.  However, most operating systems will
	    still report that the UART is only a 8250A or 16450, and may not
	    make effective use of the extra buffering present in the emulated
	    UART unless special drivers are used.</para>
	      
	  <para>Some modem makers are driven by market forces to abandon a
	    design that has hundreds of bytes of buffer and instead use a
	    16550A UART so that the product will compare favorably in market
	    comparisons even though the effective performance may be lowered
	    by this action.</para>
	      
	  <para>A common misconception is that all parts with
	    &ldquo;16550A&rdquo; written on them are identical in performance.
	    There are differences, and in some cases, outright flaws in most
	    of these 16550A clones.</para>
	      
	  <para>When the NS16550 was developed, the National Semiconductor
	    obtained several patents on the design and they also limited
	    licensing, making it harder for other vendors to provide a chip
	    with similar features.  Because of the patents, reverse-engineered
	    designs and emulations had to avoid infringing the claims covered
	    by the patents.  Subsequently, these copies almost never perform
	    exactly the same as the NS16550A or PC16550D, which are the parts
	    most computer and modem makers want to buy but are sometimes
	    unwilling to pay the price required to get the genuine
	    part.</para>
	      
	  <para>Some of the differences in the clone 16550A parts are
	    unimportant, while others can prevent the device from being used
	    at all with a given operating system or driver.  These differences
	    may show up when using other drivers, or when particular
	    combinations of events occur that were not well tested or
	    considered in the Windows driver.  This is because most modem
	    vendors and 16550-clone makers use the Microsoft drivers from
	    Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and the Microsoft MSD utility as the
	    primary tests for compatibility with the NS16550A.  This
	    over-simplistic criteria means that if a different operating
	    system is used, problems could appear due to subtle differences
	    between the clones and genuine components.</para>
	      
	  <para>National Semiconductor has made available a program named
	    <application>COMTEST</application> that performs compatibility
	    tests independent of any OS drivers.  It should be remembered that
	    the purpose of this type of program is to demonstrate the flaws in
	    the products of the competition, so the program will report major
	    as well as extremely subtle differences in behavior in the part
	    being tested.</para>
	      
	  <para>In a series of tests performed by the author of this document
	    in 1994, components made by National Semiconductor, TI, StarTech,
	    and CMD as well as megacells and emulations embedded in internal
	    modems were tested with COMTEST.  A difference count for some of
	    these components is listed below. Because these tests were
	    performed in 1994, they may not reflect the current performance of
	    the given product from a vendor.</para>
	      
	  <para>It should be noted that COMTEST normally aborts when an
	    excessive number or certain types of problems have been detected.
	    As part of this testing, COMTEST was modified so that it would not
	    abort no matter how many differences were encountered.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>To date, the author of this document has not found any
	      non-National parts that report zero differences using the
	      COMTEST program.  It should also be noted that National has had
	      five versions of the 16550 over the years and the newest parts
	      behave a bit differently than the classic NS16550AFN that is
	      considered the benchmark for functionality.  COMTEST appears to
	      turn a blind eye to the differences within the National product
	      line and reports no errors on the National parts (except for the
	      original 16550) even when there are official erratas that
	      describe bugs in the A, B and C revisions of the parts, so this
	      bias in COMTEST must be taken into account.</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>It is important to understand that a simple count of
	    differences from COMTEST does not reveal a lot about what
	    differences are important and which are not.  For example, about
	    half of the differences reported in the two modems listed above
	    that have internal UARTs were caused by the clone UARTs not
	    supporting five- and six-bit character modes.  The real 16550,
	    16450, and 8250 UARTs all support these modes and COMTEST checks
	    the functionality of these modes so over fifty differences are
	    reported.  However, almost no modern modem supports five- or
	    six-bit characters, particularly those with error-correction and
	    compression capabilities.  This means that the differences related
	    to five- and six-bit character modes can be discounted.</para>
	      
	  <para>Many of the differences COMTEST reports have to do with
	    timing.  In many of the clone designs, when the host reads from
	    one port, the status bits in some other port may not update in the
	    same amount of time (some faster, some slower) as a
	    <emphasis>real</emphasis> NS16550AFN and COMTEST looks for these
	    differences.  This means that the number of differences can be
	    misleading in that one device may only have one or two differences
	    but they are extremely serious, and some other device that updates
	    the status registers faster or slower than the reference part
	    (that would probably never affect the operation of a properly
	    written driver) could have dozens of differences reported.</para>
	      
	  <para>COMTEST can be used as a screening tool to alert the
	    administrator to the presence of potentially incompatible
	    components that might cause problems or have to be handled as a
	    special case.</para>
	      
	  <para>If you run COMTEST on a 16550 that is in a modem or a modem is
	    attached to the serial port, you need to first issue a ATE0&amp;W
	    command to the modem so that the modem will not echo any of the
	    test characters.  If you forget to do this, COMTEST will report at
	    least this one difference:</para>

	  <para>The 8250/16450/16550 UART occupies eight contiguous I/O port
	    addresses.  In the IBM PC, there are two defined locations for
	    these eight ports and they are known collectively as COM1 and
	    COM2.  The makers of PC-clones and add-on cards have created two
	    additional areas known as COM3 and COM4, but these extra COM ports
	    conflict with other hardware on some systems.  The most common
	    conflict is with video adapters that provide IBM 8514
	    emulation.</para>
	      
	  <para>COM1 is located from 0x3f8 to 0x3ff and normally uses IRQ 4
	    COM2 is located from 0x2f8 to 0x2ff and normally uses IRQ 3 COM3
	    is located from 0x3e8 to 0x3ef and has no standardized IRQ COM4 is
	    located from 0x2e8 to 0x2ef and has no standardized IRQ.</para>
	      
	  <para>A description of the I/O ports of the 8250/16450/16550 UART is

	  <para>In addition to these &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; UARTs, many vendors
	    produce intelligent serial communication boards.  This type of
	    design usually provides a microprocessor that interfaces with
	    several UARTs, processes and buffers the data, and then alerts the
	    main PC processor when necessary.  Because the UARTs are not
	    directly accessed by the PC processor in this type of
	    communication system, it is not necessary for the vendor to use
	    UARTs that are compatible with the 8250, 16450, or the 16550 UART.
	    This leaves the designer free to components that may have better
	    performance characteristics.</para>

	      1995.</emphasis></para>
	  
	  <para>The procedures to make a Boca 16 port board with FreeBSD are
	    pretty straightforward, but you will need a couple things to make
	    it work:</para>
	  
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>You either need the kernel sources installed so you can
		recompile the necessary options or you will need someone else
		to compile it for you.  The 2.0.5 default kernel does
		<emphasis>not</emphasis> come with multiport support enabled
		and you will need to add a device entry for each port
		anyways.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Two, you will need to know the interrupt and IO setting
		for your Boca Board so you can set these options properly in
		the kernel.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	  
	  <para>One important note &mdash; the actual UART chips for the Boca
	    16 are in the connector box, not on the internal board itself.  So
	    if you have it unplugged, probes of those ports will fail.  I have
	    never tested booting with the box unplugged and plugging it back
	    in, and I suggest you do not either.</para>
	      
	  <para>If you do not already have a custom kernel configuration file
	    set up, refer to <link linkend="kernelconfig">Kernel
	      Configuration</link> for general procedures.  The following are
	    the specifics for the Boca 16 board and assume you are using the
	    kernel name MYKERNEL and editing with vi.</para>
	      
	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Add the line 
		
		<programlisting>
options COM_MULTIPORT</programlisting>

		to the config file.</para>
	    </step>
	    
	    <step>
	      <para>Where the current <literal>device
		  sio<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> lines are, you
		will need to add 16 more devices.  Only the last device
		includes the interrupt vector for the board.  (See the
		  &man.sio.4; manual page for detail as
		to why.)  The following example is for a Boca Board with an
		interrupt of 3, and a base IO address 100h.  The IO address
		for Each port is +8 hexadecimal from the previous port, thus
		the 100h, 108h, 110h...  addresses.</para>

	      <programlisting>
device sio1 at isa? port 0x100 tty flags 0x1005
device sio2 at isa? port 0x108 tty flags 0x1005

&hellip;
device sio15 at isa? port 0x170 tty flags 0x1005
device sio16 at isa? port 0x178 tty flags 0x1005 irq 3 vector siointr</programlisting>

	      <para>The flags entry <emphasis>must</emphasis> be changed from
		this example unless you are using the exact same sio
		assignments. Flags are set according to
		0x<replaceable>M</replaceable><replaceable>YY</replaceable>
		where <replaceable>M</replaceable> indicates the minor number
		of the master port (the last port on a Boca 16) and
		<replaceable>YY</replaceable> indicates if FIFO is enabled or
		disabled(enabled), IRQ sharing is used(yes) and if there is an
		AST/4 compatible IRQ control register(no).  In this example,
		<programlisting> flags 0x1005</programlisting> indicates that
		the master port is sio16.  If I added another board and
		assigned sio17 through sio28, the flags for all 16 ports on
		<emphasis>that</emphasis> board would be 0x1C05, where 1C
		indicates the minor number of the master port.  Do not change
		the 05 setting.</para>
		</step>
		  
	    <step>
	      <para>Save and complete the kernel configuration, recompile,
		install and reboot.  Presuming you have successfully installed
		the recompiled kernel and have it set to the correct address
		and IRQ, your boot message should indicate the successful

		numbers, IO and IRQ could be different)</para>

	<title>Configuring the <devicename>si</devicename> driver</title>
	
	<para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.nsayer;. 25 March
	    1998.</emphasis></para>
     
	<para>The Specialix SI/XIO and SX multiport cards use the
	  <devicename>si</devicename> driver. A single machine can
	  have up to 4 host cards. The following host cards
	  are supported:</para>
	
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>ISA SI/XIO host card (2 versions)</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>EISA SI/XIO host card</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>PCI SI/XIO host card</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>ISA SX host card</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>PCI SX host card</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Although the SX and SI/XIO host cards look markedly different,
	  their functionality are basically the same. The host cards do not
	  use I/O locations, but instead require a 32K chunk of memory. The
	  factory configuration for ISA cards places this at
	  <literal>0xd0000-0xd7fff</literal>.
	  They also require an IRQ. PCI cards will, of course, autoconfigure
	  themselves.</para>

	<para>You can attach up to 4 external modules to each host card. The
	  external modules contain either 4 or 8 serial ports. They come in
	  the following varieties:</para>
	
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>SI 4 or 8 port modules. Up to 57600 bps on each port
	      supported.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>XIO 8 port modules. Up to 115200 bps on each port
	      supported. One type of XIO module has 7 serial and 1 parallel
	      port.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>SXDC 8 port modules. Up to 921600 bps on each port
	      supported. Like XIO, a module is available with one parallel
	      port as well.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>To configure an ISA host card, add the following line to your
	  <link linkend="kernelconfig-config">kernel configuration
	    file</link>, changing the numbers as appropriate:</para>
     
	<programlisting>
device si0 at isa? tty iomem 0xd0000 irq 11</programlisting>
	
	<para>Valid IRQ numbers are 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 for SX ISA host cards
	  and 11, 12 and 15 for SI/XIO ISA host cards.</para>
     
	<para>To configure an EISA or PCI host card, use this line:</para>
     
	<programlisting>
device si0</programlisting>

	<para>After adding the configuration entry, <link
	    linkend="kernelconfig-building"> rebuild and install</link>  your
	  new kernel.</para>
     
	<para>After rebooting with the new kernel, you need to make the <link
	    linkend="kernelconfig-nodes"> device nodes</link> in /dev. The
	  <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> script will take care of this for you.
	  Count how many total ports you have and type:</para>
     
	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./MAKEDEV ttyA<replaceable>nn</replaceable> cuaA<replaceable>nn</replaceable></userinput></screen>
     
	<para>(where <replaceable>nn</replaceable> is the number of
	  ports)</para>
     
	<para>If you want login prompts to appear on these ports, you will
	  need to add lines like this to <link
	    linkend="dialup"><filename>/etc/ttys</filename></link>:</para>
	
	<programlisting>
ttyA01  "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   vt100   on insecure
	</programlisting>
     
	<para>Change the terminal type as appropriate. For modems,

      <title>Using ESDI hard disks</title>
      
      <para><emphasis>Copyright &copy; 1995, &a.wilko;.  24
	  September 1995.</emphasis></para>
	  
      <para>ESDI is an acronym that means Enhanced Small Device Interface. It
	is loosely based on the good old ST506/412 interface originally
	devised by Seagate Technology, the makers of the first affordable
	5.25" winchester disk.</para>
	  
      <para>The acronym says Enhanced, and rightly so.  In the first place the
	speed of the interface is higher, 10 or 15 Mbits/second instead of the
	5 Mbits/second of ST412 interfaced drives.  Secondly some higher level
	commands are added, making the ESDI interface somewhat 'smarter' to
	the operating system driver writers.  It is by no means as smart as
	SCSI by the way.  ESDI is standardized by ANSI.</para>
	  
      <para>Capacities of the drives are boosted by putting more sectors on
	each track.  Typical is 35 sectors per track, high capacity drives I
	have seen were up to 54 sectors/track.</para>
      
      <para>Although ESDI has been largely obsoleted by IDE and SCSI
	interfaces, the availability of free or cheap surplus drives makes
	them  ideal for low (or now) budget systems.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Concepts of ESDI</title>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Physical connections</title>
	  
	  <para>The ESDI interface uses two cables connected to each drive.
	    One cable is a 34 pin flat cable edge connector that carries the
	    command and status signals from the controller to the drive and
	    vice-versa.  The command cable is daisy chained between all the
	    drives.  So, it forms a bus onto which all drives are
	    connected.</para>
	      
	  <para>The second cable is a 20 pin flat cable edge connector that
	    carries the data to and from the drive.  This cable is radially
	    connected, so each drive has its own direct connection to the
	    controller.</para>
	      
	  <para>To the best of my knowledge PC ESDI controllers are limited to
	    using a maximum of 2 drives per controller.  This is compatibility
	    feature(?) left over from the WD1003 standard that reserves only a
	    single bit for device addressing.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Device addressing</title>
	  
	  <para>On each command cable a maximum of 7 devices and 1 controller
	    can be present.  To enable the controller to uniquely  identify
	    which drive it addresses, each ESDI device is equipped with
	    jumpers or switches to select the devices address.</para>
	      
	  <para>On PC type controllers the first drive is set to address 0,
	    the second disk to address 1.  <emphasis>Always make
	      sure</emphasis> you set each disk to an unique address! So, on a
	    PC with its two drives/controller maximum the first drive is drive
	    0, the second is drive 1.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Termination</title>
	  
	  <para>The daisy chained command cable (the 34 pin cable remember?)
	    needs to be terminated at the last drive on the chain.  For this
	    purpose ESDI drives come with a termination resistor network that
	    can be removed or disabled by a jumper when it is not used.</para>
	  
	  <para>So, one and <emphasis>only</emphasis> one drive, the one at
	    the farthest end of the command cable has its terminator
	    installed/enabled.  The controller automatically terminates the
	    other end of the cable.  Please note that this implies that the
	    controller must be  at one end of the cable and
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the middle.</para>

	<title>Using ESDI disks with FreeBSD</title>
	
	<para>Why is ESDI such a pain to get working in the first
	  place?</para>
	
	<para>People who tried ESDI disks with FreeBSD are known to have
	  developed a profound sense of frustration.  A combination of factors
	  works against you to produce effects that are hard to understand
	  when you have never seen them before.</para>
	    
	<para>This has also led to the popular legend ESDI and FreeBSD is a
	  plain NO-GO.  The following sections try to list all the pitfalls
	  and  solutions.</para>
	    
	<sect4>
	  <title>ESDI speed variants</title>
	  
	  <para>As briefly mentioned before, ESDI comes in two speed flavors.
	    The older drives and controllers use a 10 Mbits/second data
	    transfer rate.  Newer stuff uses 15 Mbits/second.</para>
	      
	  <para>It is not hard to imagine that 15 Mbits/second drive cause
	    problems on controllers laid out for 10 Mbits/second.  As always,
	    consult your controller <emphasis>and</emphasis> drive
	    documentation to see if things match.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Stay on track</title>
	  
	  <para>Mainstream ESDI drives use 34 to 36 sectors per track. Most
	    (older) controllers cannot handle more than this  number of
	    sectors.  Newer, higher capacity, drives use higher numbers of
	    sectors per track.  For instance, I own a 670 Mb drive that has 54
	    sectors per track.</para>
	      
	  <para>In my case, the controller could not handle this number of
	    sectors.  It proved to work well except that it only used 35
	    sectors on each track.  This meant losing a lot of disk
	    space.</para>
	      
	  <para>Once again, check the documentation of your hardware for more
	    info.  Going out-of-spec like in the example might or might not
	    work.  Give it a try or get another more capable
	    controller.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Hard or soft sectoring</title>
	  
	  <para>Most ESDI drives allow hard or soft sectoring to be selected
	    using a jumper.  Hard sectoring means that the drive will produce
	    a sector pulse on the start of each new sector. The controller
	    uses this pulse to tell when it should start to write or
	    read.</para>
	  
	  <para>Hard sectoring allows a selection of sector size (normally
	    256, 512 or 1024 bytes per formatted sector).  FreeBSD uses 512
	    byte sectors.  The number of sectors per track also varies while
	    still using the same number of bytes per formatted sector.  The
	    number of <emphasis>unformatted</emphasis> bytes per sector
	    varies, dependent on your controller it needs more or less
	    overhead  bytes to work correctly.  Pushing more sectors on a
	    track  of course gives you more usable space, but might give
	    problems if your controller needs more bytes than the  drive
	    offers.</para>
	      
	  <para>In case of soft sectoring, the controller itself determines
	    where to start/stop reading or writing.  For ESDI hard sectoring
	    is the default (at least on everything I came across).  I never
	    felt the urge to try soft sectoring.</para>
	      
	  <para>In general, experiment with sector settings before you install
	    FreeBSD because you need to re-run the low-level format after each
	    change.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Low level formatting</title>
	  
	  <para>ESDI drives need to be low level formatted before they are
	    usable.  A reformat is needed whenever you figgle with the number
	    of sectors/track jumpers or the physical orientation of the drive
	    (horizontal, vertical).  So, first think, then format.  The format
	    time must not be underestimated, for big disks it can take
	    hours.</para>
	      
	  <para>After a low level format, a surface scan is done to find and
	    flag bad sectors.  Most disks have a manufacturer bad block list
	    listed on a piece of paper or adhesive sticker.  In addition, on
	    most disks the list is also written onto the disk.  Please use the
	    manufacturer's list.  It is much easier to remap a defect now than
	    after FreeBSD is installed.</para>
	      
	  <para>Stay away from low-level formatters that mark all sectors of a
	    track as bad as soon as they find one bad sector.  Not only does
	    this waste space, it also and more importantly causes you grief
	    with bad144 (see the section on bad144).</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Translations</title>
	  
	  <para>Translations, although not exclusively a ESDI-only problem,
	    might give you real trouble.  Translations come in multiple
	    flavors.  Most of them  have in common that they attempt to work
	    around the limitations posed upon disk geometries by the original
	    IBM PC/AT design (thanks IBM!).</para>
	      
	  <para>First of all there is the (in)famous 1024 cylinder limit. For
	    a system to be able to boot, the stuff (whatever operating system)
	    must be in the first 1024 cylinders of a disk.  Only 10 bits are
	    available to encode the cylinder number.  For the number of
	    sectors the limit is 64 (0-63).  When you combine the 1024
	    cylinder limit with the 16 head limit (also a design feature) you
	    max out at fairly limited  disk sizes.</para>
	      
	  <para>To work around this problem, the manufacturers of ESDI PC
	    controllers added a BIOS prom extension on their boards.  This
	    BIOS extension handles disk I/O for booting (and for some
	    operating systems <emphasis>all</emphasis> disk I/O) by using
	    translation.  For instance, a big drive might be presented to the
	    system as having 32 heads and 64 sectors/track.  The result is
	    that the number of cylinders is reduced to something below 1024
	    and is therefore usable by the system without problems.  It is
	    noteworthy to know that FreeBSD does not use the BIOS after its
	    kernel has started.  More on this later.</para>
	      
	  <para>A second reason for translations is the fact that most older
	    system BIOSes could only handle drives with 17 sectors per track
	    (the old ST412 standard).  Newer system BIOSes usually have a
	    user-defined drive type (in most cases this is drive type
	    47).</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Whatever you do to translations after reading this document,
	      keep in mind that if you have multiple operating systems on the
	      same disk, all must use the same translation</para>
	  </warning>
	  
	  <para>While on the subject of translations, I have seen one
	    controller type (but there are probably more like this) offer the
	    option to logically split a drive in multiple partitions as a BIOS
	    option.  I had select 1 drive == 1 partition because this
	    controller wrote this info onto the disk.  On power-up it read the
	    info and presented itself to the system based on the info from the
	    disk.</para>
	</sect4>
	    
	<sect4>
	  <title>Spare sectoring</title>
	  
	  <para>Most ESDI controllers offer the possibility to remap bad
	    sectors.  During/after the low-level format of the disk bad
	    sectors are marked as such, and a replacement sector is put in
	    place (logically of course) of the bad one.</para>
	      
	  <para>In most cases the remapping is done by using N-1 sectors on
	    each track for actual data storage, and sector N itself is the
	    spare sector.  N is the total number of sectors physically
	    available on the track.  The idea behind this is that the
	    operating system sees a 'perfect' disk without bad sectors.  In
	    the case of FreeBSD this concept is not usable.</para>
	      
	  <para>The problem is that the translation from
	    <emphasis>bad</emphasis> to <emphasis>good</emphasis> is performed
	    by the BIOS of the ESDI controller.  FreeBSD, being a true 32 bit
	    operating system, does not use the BIOS after it has been booted.
	    Instead, it has device drivers that talk directly to the
	    hardware.</para>
	      
	  <para><emphasis>So: don't use spare sectoring, bad block remapping
	      or whatever it may be called by the controller manufacturer when
	      you want to use the disk for FreeBSD.</emphasis></para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Bad block handling</title>
	  
	  <para>The preceding section leaves us with a problem.  The
	    controller's bad block handling is not usable and still FreeBSD's
	    filesystems assume perfect media without any flaws. To solve this
	    problem, FreeBSD use the <command>bad144</command> tool.  Bad144
	    (named after a Digital Equipment standard for bad block handling)
	    scans a FreeBSD slice for bad blocks.  Having found these bad
	    blocks, it writes a table with the offending block numbers to the
	    end of the FreeBSD slice.</para>
	      
	  <para>When the disk is in operation, the disk accesses are checked
	    against the table read from the disk.  Whenever a block number is
	    requested that is in the <command>bad144</command> list, a
	    replacement block (also from the end of the FreeBSD slice) is
	    used.  In this way, the <command>bad144</command> replacement
	    scheme presents 'perfect' media to the FreeBSD filesystems.</para>
	      
	  <para>There are a number of potential pitfalls associated with the
	    use of <command>bad144</command>.  First of all, the slice cannot
	    have more than 126 bad sectors.  If your drive has a high number
	    of bad sectors, you might need to divide it into multiple FreeBSD
	    slices each containing less than 126 bad sectors.  Stay away from
	    low-level format programs that mark <emphasis>every</emphasis>
	    sector of a track as bad when  they find a flaw on the track.  As
	    you can imagine, the  126 limit is quickly reached when the
	    low-level format is done this way.</para>
	      
	  <para>Second, if the slice contains the root filesystem, the slice
	    should be within the 1024 cylinder BIOS limit.  During the boot
	    process the bad144 list is read using the BIOS and this only
	    succeeds when the list is within the 1024 cylinder limit.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>The restriction is not that only the root
	      <emphasis>filesystem</emphasis> must be within the 1024 cylinder
	      limit, but rather the entire <emphasis>slice</emphasis> that
	      contains the root filesystem.</para>

	  <title>Adaptec 2320 controllers</title>
	  
	  <para>I successfully installed FreeBSD onto a ESDI disk controlled
	    by a ACB-2320.  No other operating system was present on the
	    disk.</para>
	      
	  <para>To do so I low level formatted the disk using
	    <command>NEFMT.EXE</command> (<command>ftp</command>able from
	    <hostid role="fqdn">www.adaptec.com</hostid>) and answered NO to
	    the question whether the disk should be formatted with a spare
	    sector on each track.  The BIOS on the ACD-2320 was disabled.  I
	    used the <literal>free configurable</literal> option in the system
	    BIOS to allow the BIOS to boot it.</para>
	      
	  <para>Before using <command>NEFMT.EXE</command> I tried to format
	    the disk using the ACB-2320 BIOS builtin formatter.  This proved
	    to be a show stopper, because it did not give me an option to
	    disable spare sectoring.  With spare sectoring enabled the FreeBSD
	    installation process broke down on the <command>bad144</command>
	    run.</para>

	  <para>The <literal>y</literal> is more interesting.  It can either
	    be a blank, a <literal>A-8</literal> or a <literal>D</literal>.  A
	    blank indicates a plain 10 Mbits/second controller.  An
	    <literal>A-8</literal> indicates a 15 Mbits/second controller
	    capable of handling 52 sectors/track.  A <literal>D</literal>
	    means a 15 Mbits/second controller that can also handle drives
	    with &gt; 36 sectors/track (also 52 ?).</para>

	  <title>Western Digital WD1007 controllers</title>

	  <para>To get it to work, I had to disable the sector translation and

      <title>What is SCSI?</title>
      
      <para><emphasis>Copyright &copy; 1995, &a.wilko;.  July 6,
	  1996.</emphasis></para>
	  
      <para>SCSI is an acronym for Small Computer Systems Interface.  It is an
	ANSI standard that has become one of the leading I/O buses in the
	computer industry.  The foundation of the SCSI standard was laid by
	Shugart Associates (the same guys that gave the world the first mini
	floppy disks) when they introduced the SASI bus (Shugart Associates
	Standard Interface).</para>
	  
      <para>After some time an industry effort was started to come to a more
	strict standard allowing devices from different vendors to work
	together.  This effort was recognized in the ANSI SCSI-1 standard.
	The SCSI-1 standard (approx 1985) is rapidly becoming obsolete.  The
	current standard is SCSI-2 (see <link
	  linkend="scsi-further-reading">Further reading</link>), with SCSI-3
	on the drawing boards.</para>
	  
      <para>In addition to a physical interconnection standard, SCSI defines a
	logical (command set) standard to which disk devices must adhere.
	This standard is called the Common Command Set (CCS) and was developed
	more or less in parallel with ANSI SCSI-1. SCSI-2 includes the
	(revised) CCS as part of the standard itself. The commands are
	dependent on the type of device at hand.  It does not make much sense
	of course to define a Write command for a scanner.</para>
	  
      <para>The SCSI bus is a parallel bus, which comes in a number of
	variants.  The oldest and most used is an 8 bit wide bus, with
	single-ended signals, carried on 50 wires.  (If you do not know what
	single-ended means, do not worry, that is what this document is all
	about.)  Modern designs also use 16 bit wide buses, with differential
	signals.  This allows transfer speeds of 20Mbytes/second, on cables
	lengths of up to 25 meters.  SCSI-2 allows a maximum bus width of 32
	bits, using an additional cable. Quickly emerging are Ultra SCSI (also
	called Fast-20) and Ultra2 (also called Fast-40).  Fast-20 is 20
	million transfers per second (20 Mbytes/sec on a 8 bit bus), Fast-40
	is 40 million transfers per second (40 Mbytes/sec on a 8 bit bus).
	Most hard drives sold today are single-ended Ultra SCSI (8 or 16
	bits).</para>
	  
      <para>Of course the SCSI bus not only has data lines, but also a number
	of control signals.  A very elaborate protocol is part of the standard
	to allow multiple devices to share the bus in an efficient manner.  In
	SCSI-2, the data is always checked using a separate parity line.  In
	pre-SCSI-2 designs parity was optional.</para>
	  
      <para>In SCSI-3 even faster bus types are introduced, along with a
	serial SCSI busses that reduces the cabling overhead and allows a
	higher maximum bus length.  You might see names like SSA and
	Fiberchannel in this context.  None of the serial buses are currently
	in widespread use (especially not in the typical FreeBSD environment).
	For this reason the serial bus types are not discussed any
	further.</para>
	  
      <para>As you could have guessed from the description above, SCSI devices
	are intelligent.  They have to be to adhere to the SCSI standard
	(which is over 2 inches thick BTW).  So, for a hard disk drive for
	instance you do not specify a head/cylinder/sector to address a
	particular block, but simply the number of the block you want.
	Elaborate caching schemes, automatic bad block replacement etc are all
	made possible by this 'intelligent device' approach.</para>
	  
      <para>On a SCSI bus, each possible pair of devices can communicate.
	Whether their function allows this is another matter, but the standard
	does not restrict it.  To avoid signal contention, the 2 devices have
	to arbitrate for the bus before using it.</para>
	  
      <para>The philosophy of SCSI is to have a standard that allows
	older-standard devices to work with newer-standard ones.  So, an old
	SCSI-1 device should normally work on a SCSI-2 bus.  I say Normally,
	because it is not absolutely sure that the implementation of an old
	device follows the (old) standard closely enough to be acceptable on a
	new bus.  Modern devices are usually more well-behaved, because the
	standardization has become more strict and is better adhered to by the
	device manufacturers.</para>
	  
      <para>Generally speaking, the chances of getting a working set of
	devices on a single bus is better when all the devices are SCSI-2 or
	newer.  This implies that you do not have to dump all your old stuff
	when you get that shiny 2GB disk: I own a system on which a pre-SCSI-1
	disk, a SCSI-2 QIC tape unit, a SCSI-1 helical scan tape unit and 2
	SCSI-1 disks work together quite happily.  From a performance
	standpoint you might want to separate your older and newer (=faster)
	devices however.</para>
      
      <sect3>
	<title>Components of SCSI</title>
	
	<para>As said before, SCSI devices are smart.  The idea is to put the
	  knowledge about intimate hardware details onto the SCSI device
	  itself.  In this way, the host system does not have to worry about
	  things like how many heads are hard disks has, or how many tracks
	  there are on a specific tape device.  If you are curious, the
	  standard specifies commands with which you can query your devices on
	  their hardware particulars.  FreeBSD uses this capability during
	  boot to check out what devices are connected and whether they need
	  any special treatment.</para>
	    
	<para>The advantage of intelligent devices is obvious: the device
	  drivers on the host can be made in a much more generic fashion,
	  there is no longer a need to change (and qualify!) drivers for every
	  odd new device that is introduced.</para>
	    
	<para>For cabling and connectors there is a golden rule: get good
	  stuff.  With bus speeds going up all the time you will save yourself
	  a lot of grief by using good material.</para>
	    
	<para>So, gold plated connectors, shielded cabling, sturdy connector
	  hoods with strain reliefs etc are the way to go. Second golden rule:
	  do no use cables longer than necessary.  I once spent 3 days hunting
	  down a problem with a flaky machine only to discover that shortening
	  the SCSI bus by 1 meter solved the problem.  And the original bus
	  length was well within the SCSI specification.</para>
      </sect3>
	  
      <sect3>
	<title>SCSI bus types</title>
	
	<para>From an electrical point of view, there are two incompatible bus
	  types: single-ended and differential.  This means that there are two
	  different main groups of SCSI devices and controllers, which cannot
	  be mixed on the same bus.  It is possible however to use special
	  converter hardware to transform a single-ended bus into a
	  differential one (and vice versa).  The differences between the bus
	  types are explained in the next sections.</para>
	    
	<para>In lots of SCSI related documentation there is a sort of jargon
	  in use to abbreviate the different bus types.  A small list:</para>
	    
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>FWD:	Fast Wide Differential</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>FND:	Fast Narrow Differential</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>SE:	Single Ended</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>FN:	Fast Narrow</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>etc.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	
	
	<para>With a minor amount of imagination one can usually imagine what
	  is meant.</para>
	    
	<para>Wide is a bit ambiguous, it can indicate 16 or 32 bit buses. As
	  far as I know, the 32 bit variant is not (yet) in use, so wide
	  normally means 16 bit.</para>
	    
	<para>Fast means that the timing on the bus is somewhat different, so
	  that on a narrow (8 bit) bus 10 Mbytes/sec are possible instead of 5
	  Mbytes/sec for 'slow' SCSI.  As discussed before, bus speeds of 20
	  and 40 million transfers/second are also emerging  (Fast-20 == Ultra
	  SCSI and Fast-40 == Ultra2 SCSI).</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The data lines &gt; 8 are only used for data transfers and
	    device addressing.  The transfers of commands and status messages
	    etc are only performed on the lowest 8 data lines. The standard
	    allows narrow devices to operate on a wide bus. The usable bus
	    width is negotiated between the devices.  You have to watch your
	    device addressing closely when mixing wide and narrow.</para>
	</note>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Single ended buses</title>
	  
	  <para>A single-ended SCSI bus uses signals that are either 5 Volts
	    or 0 Volts (indeed, TTL levels) and are relative to a COMMON
	    ground reference.  A singled ended 8 bit SCSI bus has
	    approximately 25 ground lines, who are all tied to a single `rail'
	    on all devices.  A standard single ended bus has a maximum length
	    of 6 meters.  If the same bus is used with fast-SCSI devices, the
	    maximum length allowed drops to 3 meters.  Fast-SCSI means that
	    instead of 5Mbytes/sec the bus allows 10Mbytes/sec
	    transfers.</para>
	      
	  <para>Fast-20 (Ultra SCSI) and Fast-40 allow for 20 and 40 million
	    transfers/second respectively.  So, F20 is 20 Mbytes/second on a 8
	    bit bus, 40 Mbytes/second on a 16 bit bus etc.  For F20 the max
	    bus length is 1.5 meters, for F40 it becomes 0.75 meters.  Be
	    aware that F20 is pushing  the limits quite a bit, so you will
	    quickly find out if your SCSI bus is electrically sound.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If some devices on your bus use 'fast' to communicate your
	      bus must adhere to the length restrictions for fast
	      buses!</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>It is obvious that with the newer fast-SCSI devices the bus
	    length can become a real bottleneck.  This is why the differential
	    SCSI bus was introduced in the SCSI-2 standard.</para>
	      
	  <para>For connector pinning and connector types please refer to the
	    SCSI-2 standard (see <link linkend="scsi-further-reading">Further
	      reading</link>) itself, connectors etc are listed there in
	    painstaking detail.</para>
	  
	  <para>Beware of devices using non-standard cabling.  For instance
	    Apple uses a 25pin D-type connecter (like the one on serial ports
	    and parallel printers).  Considering that the official SCSI bus
	    needs 50 pins you can imagine the use of this connector needs some
	    'creative cabling'.  The reduction of the number of ground wires
	    they used is a bad idea, you better stick to 50 pins cabling  in
	    accordance with the SCSI standard.  For Fast-20 and 40 do not even
	    think about buses like this.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Differential buses</title>
	  
	  <para>A differential SCSI bus has a maximum length of 25 meters.
	    Quite a difference from the 3 meters for a single-ended fast-SCSI
	    bus.  The idea behind differential signals is that each bus signal
	    has its own return wire.  So, each signal is carried on a
	    (preferably twisted) pair of wires.  The voltage difference
	    between these two wires determines whether the signal is asserted
	    or de-asserted.  To a certain extent the voltage difference
	    between ground and the signal wire pair is not relevant (do not
	    try 10 kVolts though).</para>
	      
	  <para>It is beyond the scope of this document to explain why this
	    differential idea is so much better.  Just accept that
	    electrically seen the use of differential signals gives a much
	    better noise margin.  You will normally find differential buses in
	    use for inter-cabinet connections.  Because of the lower cost
	    single ended is mostly used for shorter buses like inside
	    cabinets.</para>
	      
	  <para>There is nothing that stops you from using differential stuff
	    with FreeBSD, as long as you use a controller that has device
	    driver support in FreeBSD.  As an example, Adaptec marketed the
	    AHA1740 as a single ended board, whereas the AHA1744 was
	    differential.  The software interface to the host is identical for
	    both.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Terminators</title>
	  
	  <para>Terminators in SCSI terminology are resistor networks that are
	    used to get a correct impedance matching.  Impedance matching is
	    important to get clean signals on the bus, without reflections or
	    ringing.  If you once made a long distance telephone call on a bad
	    line you probably know what reflections are.  With 20Mbytes/sec
	    traveling over your SCSI bus, you do not want signals echoing
	    back.</para>
	      
	  <para>Terminators come in various incarnations, with more or less
	    sophisticated designs.  Of course, there are internal and external
	    variants.  Many SCSI devices come with a number of sockets in
	    which a number of resistor networks can (must be!) installed.  If
	    you remove terminators from a device, carefully store them.  You
	    will need them when you ever decide to reconfigure your SCSI bus.
	    There is enough variation in even these simple tiny things to make
	    finding the exact replacement a frustrating business.  There are
	    also SCSI devices that have a single jumper to enable or disable a
	    built-in terminator. There are special terminators you can stick
	    onto a flat cable bus.  Others look like external connectors, or a
	    connector hood without a cable.  So, lots of choice as you can
	    see.</para>
	      
	  <para>There is much debate going on if and when you should switch
	    from simple resistor (passive) terminators to active terminators.
	    Active terminators contain slightly more elaborate circuit to give
	    cleaner bus signals.  The general consensus seems to be that the
	    usefulness of active termination increases when you have long
	    buses and/or fast devices.  If you ever have problems with your
	    SCSI buses you might consider trying an active terminator.  Try to
	    borrow one first, they reputedly are quite expensive.</para>
	      
	  <para>Please keep in mind that terminators for differential and
	    single-ended buses are not identical.  You should <emphasis>not
	      mix</emphasis> the two variants.</para>
	      
	  <para>OK, and now where should you install your terminators? This is
	    by far the most misunderstood part of SCSI.  And it is by far the
	    simplest.  The rule is: <emphasis>every single line on the SCSI
	      bus has 2 (two) terminators, one at each end of the
	      bus.</emphasis> So, two and not one or three or whatever.  Do
	    yourself a favor and stick to this rule.  It will save you endless
	    grief, because wrong termination has the potential to introduce
	    highly mysterious bugs.  (Note the &ldquo;potential&rdquo; here;
	    the nastiest part is that it may or may not work.)</para>
	      
	  <para>A common pitfall is to have an internal (flat) cable in a
	    machine and also an external cable attached to the controller. It
	    seems almost everybody forgets to remove the terminators from the
	    controller.  The terminator must now be on the last external
	    device, and not on the controller! In general, every
	    reconfiguration of a SCSI bus must pay attention to this.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Termination is to be done on a per-line basis.  This means
	      if you have both narrow and wide buses connected to the same
	      host adapter, you need to enable termination on the higher 8
	      bits of the bus on the adapter (as well as the last devices on
	      each bus, of course).</para>
	      </note>
	      
	  <para>What I did myself is remove all terminators from my SCSI
	    devices and controllers.  I own a couple of external terminators,
	    for both the Centronics-type external cabling and for the internal
	    flat cable connectors.  This makes reconfiguration much
	    easier.</para>
	      
	  <para>On modern devices, sometimes integrated terminators are used.
	    These things are special purpose integrated circuits that can be
	    dis/en-abled with a control pin.  It is not necessary to
	    physically remove them from a device.  You may find them on newer
	    host adapters, sometimes they are software configurable, using
	    some sort of setup tool.  Some will even auto-detect the cables
	    attached to the connectors and automatically set up the
	    termination as necessary.  At any rate, consult your
	    documentation!</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Terminator power</title>
	  
	  <para>The terminators discussed in the previous chapter need power
	    to operate properly.  On the SCSI bus, a line is dedicated to this
	    purpose.  So, simple huh?</para>
	      
	  <para>Not so.  Each device can provide its own terminator power to
	    the terminator sockets it has on-device.  But if you have external
	    terminators, or when the device supplying the terminator power to
	    the SCSI bus line is switched off you are in trouble.</para>
	      
	  <para>The idea is that initiators (these are devices that initiate
	    actions on the bus, a discussion follows) must supply terminator
	    power.  All SCSI devices are allowed (but not required) to supply
	    terminator power.</para>
	      
	  <para>To allow for un-powered devices on a bus, the terminator power
	    must be supplied to the bus via a diode.  This prevents the
	    backflow of current to un-powered devices.</para>
	      
	  <para>To prevent all kinds of nastiness, the terminator power is
	    usually fused.  As you can imagine, fuses might blow.  This can,
	    but does not have to, lead to a non functional bus.  If multiple
	    devices supply terminator power, a single blown fuse will not put
	    you out of business.  A single supplier with a blown fuse
	    certainly will.  Clever external terminators sometimes have a  LED
	    indication that shows whether terminator power is present.</para>
	      
	  <para>In newer designs auto-restoring fuses that 'reset' themselves
	    after some time are sometimes used.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Device addressing</title>
	  
	  <para>Because the SCSI bus is, ehh, a bus there must be a way to
	    distinguish or address the different devices connected to
	    it.</para>
	      
	  <para>This is done by means of the SCSI or target ID.  Each device
	    has a unique target ID.  You can select the ID to which a device
	    must respond using a set of jumpers, or a dip switch, or something
	    similar.  Some SCSI host adapters let you change the target ID
	    from the boot menu.  (Yet some others will not let you change the
	    ID from 7.)  Consult the documentation of your device for more
	    information.</para>
	  
	  <para>Beware of multiple devices configured to use the same ID.
	    Chaos normally reigns in this case.  A pitfall is that one of the
	    devices sharing the same ID sometimes even manages to answer to
	    I/O requests!</para>
	      
	  <para>For an 8 bit bus, a maximum of 8 targets is possible.  The
	    maximum is 8 because the selection is done bitwise using the 8
	    data lines on the bus.  For wide buses this increases to the
	    number of data lines (usually 16).</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>A narrow SCSI device can not communicate with a SCSI device
	      with a target ID larger than 7.  This means it is generally not
	      a good idea to move your SCSI host adapter's target ID to
	      something higher than 7 (or your CD-ROM will stop
	      working).</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>The higher the SCSI target ID, the higher the priority the
	    devices has.  When it comes to arbitration between devices that
	    want to use the bus at the same time, the device that has the
	    highest SCSI ID will win.  This also means that the SCSI host
	    adapter usually uses target ID 7.  Note however that the lower 8
	    IDs have higher priorities than the higher 8 IDs on a wide-SCSI
	    bus.  Thus, the order of target IDs is: [7 6 .. 1 0 15 14 .. 9 8]
	    on a wide-SCSI system.  (If you you are wondering why the lower 8
	    have higher priority, read the previous paragraph for a
	    hint.)</para>
	      
	  <para>For a further subdivision, the standard allows for Logical
	    Units or LUNs for short.  A single target ID may have multiple
	    LUNs.  For example, a tape device including a tape changer may
	    have LUN 0 for the tape device itself, and LUN 1 for the tape
	    changer.  In this way, the host system can address each of the
	    functional units of the tape changer as desired.</para>
	</sect4>
	    
	<sect4>
	  <title>Bus layout</title>
	  
	  <para>SCSI buses are linear.  So, not shaped like Y-junctions, star
	    topologies, rings, cobwebs or whatever else people might want to
	    invent.  One of the most common mistakes is for people with
	    wide-SCSI host adapters to connect devices on all three connecters
	    (external connector, internal wide connector, internal narrow
	    connector).  Don't do that.  It may appear to work if you are
	    really lucky, but I can almost guarantee that your system will
	    stop functioning at the most unfortunate moment (this is also
	    known as &ldquo;Murphy's law&rdquo;).</para>
	      
	  <para>You might notice that the terminator issue discussed earlier
	    becomes rather hairy if your bus is not linear.  Also, if you have
	    more connectors than devices on your internal SCSI cable, make
	    sure you attach devices on connectors on both ends instead of
	    using the connectors in the middle and let one or both ends
	    dangle.  This will screw up the termination of the bus.</para>
	      
	  <para>The electrical characteristics, its noise margins and
	    ultimately the reliability of it all are tightly related to linear
	    bus rule.</para>
	  
	  <para><emphasis>Stick to the linear bus rule!</emphasis></para>

	    BIOS built-in setup) how your disk physically looked like.  This
	    involved stating number of heads, number of cylinders, number of
	    sectors per track, obscure things like precompensation and reduced
	    write current cylinder etc.</para>
	      
	  <para>One might be inclined to think that since SCSI disks are smart
	    you can forget about this.  Alas, the arcane setup issue is still
	    present today.  The system BIOS needs to know how to access your
	    SCSI disk with the head/cyl/sector method in order to load the
	    FreeBSD kernel during boot.</para>
	      
	  <para>The SCSI host adapter or SCSI controller you have put in your
	    AT/EISA/PCI/whatever bus to connect your disk therefore has its
	    own on-board BIOS.  During system startup, the SCSI BIOS takes
	    over the hard disk interface routines from the system BIOS.  To
	    fool the system BIOS, the system setup is normally set to No hard
	    disk present.  Obvious, isn't it?</para>
	      
	  <para>The SCSI BIOS itself presents to the system a so called
	    <emphasis>translated</emphasis> drive.  This means that a fake
	    drive table is constructed that allows the PC to boot the drive.
	    This translation is often (but not always) done using a pseudo
	    drive with 64 heads and 32 sectors per track.  By varying the
	    number of cylinders, the SCSI BIOS adapts to the actual drive
	    size.  It is useful to note that 32 * 64 / 2 = the size of your
	    drive in megabytes.  The division by 2 is to get from disk blocks
	    that are normally 512 bytes in size to Kbytes.</para>
	      
	  <para>Right.  All is well now?! No, it is not.  The system BIOS has
	    another quirk you might run into.  The number of cylinders of a
	    bootable hard disk cannot be greater than 1024.  Using the
	    translation above, this is a show-stopper for disks greater than 1
	    GB.  With disk capacities going up all the time this is causing
	    problems.</para>
	      
	  <para>Fortunately, the solution is simple: just use another
	    translation, e.g. with 128 heads instead of 32.  In most cases new
	    SCSI BIOS versions are available to upgrade older SCSI host
	    adapters.  Some newer adapters have an option, in the form of a
	    jumper or software setup selection, to switch the translation the
	    SCSI BIOS uses.</para>
	      
	  <para>It is very important that <emphasis>all</emphasis> operating
	    systems on the disk use the <emphasis>same translation</emphasis>
	    to get the right idea about where to find the relevant partitions.
	    So, when installing FreeBSD you must answer any questions about
	    heads/cylinders etc using the translated values your host adapter
	    uses.</para>
	      
	  <para>Failing to observe the translation issue might lead to
	    un-bootable systems or operating systems overwriting each others
	    partitions.  Using fdisk you should be able to see all
	    partitions.</para>
	      
	  <para>You might have heard some talk of &ldquo;lying&rdquo; devices?
	    Older FreeBSD kernels used to report the geometry of SCSI disks
	    when booting.  An example from one of my systems:</para>
	      
	  <screen>aha0 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;MICROP 1588-15MB1057404HSP4&gt;
sd0: 636MB (1303250 total sec), 1632 cyl, 15 head, 53 sec, bytes/sec 512</screen>

	  <para>Newer kernels usually do not report this information.
	    e.g.</para>

	  <screen>(bt0:0:0): "SEAGATE ST41651 7574" type 0 fixed SCSI 2
sd0(bt0:0:0): Direct-Access 1350MB (2766300 512 byte sectors)</screen>
		
	  <para>Why has this changed?</para>
	      
	  <para>This info is retrieved from the SCSI disk itself.  Newer disks
	    often use a technique called zone bit recording.  The idea is that
	    on the outer cylinders of the drive there is more space so more
	    sectors per track can be put on them.  This results in disks that
	    have more tracks on outer cylinders than on the inner cylinders
	    and, last but not least, have more capacity.  You can imagine that
	    the value reported by the drive when inquiring about the geometry
	    now becomes suspect at best, and nearly always misleading.  When
	    asked for a geometry , it is nearly always better to supply the
	    geometry used by the BIOS, or <emphasis>if the BIOS is never going
	      to know about this disk</emphasis>, (e.g. it is not a booting
	    disk) to supply a fictitious geometry that is convenient.</para>

	  <title>SCSI subsystem design</title>
	  
	  <para>FreeBSD uses a layered SCSI subsystem.  For each different
	    controller card a device driver is written.  This driver knows all
	    the intimate details about the hardware it controls.  The driver
	    has a interface to the upper layers of the SCSI subsystem through
	    which it receives its commands and reports back any status.</para>
	      
	  <para>On top of the card drivers there are a number of more generic
	    drivers for a class of devices.  More specific: a driver for tape
	    devices (abbreviation: st), magnetic disks (sd), CD-ROMs (cd) etc.
	    In case you are wondering where you can find this stuff, it all
	    lives in <filename>/sys/scsi</filename>.  See the man pages in
	    section 4 for more details.</para>
	      
	  <para>The multi level design allows a decoupling of low-level bit
	    banging and more high level stuff.  Adding support for another
	    piece of hardware is a much more manageable problem.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Kernel configuration</title>
	  
	  <para>Dependent on your hardware, the kernel configuration file must
	    contain one or more lines describing your host adapter(s).  This
	    includes I/O addresses, interrupts etc. Consult the man page for
	    your adapter driver to get more info. Apart from that, check out
	    <filename>/sys/i386/conf/LINT</filename> for an overview of a
	    kernel config file.  <filename>LINT</filename> contains every
	    possible option you can dream of.  It does
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> imply <filename>LINT</filename> will
	    actually get you to a working kernel at all.</para>
	  
	  <para>Although it is probably stating the obvious: the kernel config
	    file should reflect your actual hardware setup.  So, interrupts,
	    I/O addresses etc must match the kernel config file.  During
	    system boot messages will be displayed to indicate whether the
	    configured hardware was actually found.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Note that most of the EISA/PCI drivers (namely
	      <devicename>ahb</devicename>, <devicename>ahc</devicename>,
	      <devicename>ncr</devicename> and <devicename>amd</devicename>
	      will automatically obtain the correct parameters from the host
	      adapters themselves at boot time; thus, you just need to write,
	      for instance, <literal>controller ahc0</literal>.</para>

	  <para>The example above tells the kernel to look for a ahc (Adaptec
	    274x) controller, then for an NCR/Symbios board, and so on.  The
	    lines following the controller specifications  tell the kernel to
	    configure specific devices but <emphasis>only</emphasis> attach
	    them when they match the target ID and LUN specified on the
	    corresponding bus.</para>
	      
	  <para>Wired down devices get &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; at the unit
	    numbers so the first non &ldquo;wired down&rdquo; device, is
	    allocated the unit number  one greater than the highest
	    &ldquo;wired down&rdquo; unit number for that kind of device.  So,
	    if you had a SCSI tape at target ID 2 it would be configured as
	    st2, as the tape at target ID 6 is wired down to unit number
	    1.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Wired down devices need not be found to get their unit
	      number.  The unit number for a wired down device is reserved for
	      that device, even if it is turned off at boot time.  This allows

	      without rebooting.  Notice that a device's unit number has
	      <emphasis>no</emphasis> relationship with its target ID on  the
	      SCSI bus.</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>Below is another example of a kernel config file as used by
	    FreeBSD version &lt; 2.0.5.  The difference with the first example
	    is that devices are not &ldquo;wired down&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Wired
	    down&rdquo; means that you specify which SCSI target belongs to
	    which device.</para>
	      
	  <para>A kernel built to the config file below will attach  the first
	    SCSI disk it finds to sd0, the second disk to sd1 etc. If you ever
	    removed or added a disk, all other devices of the same type (disk
	    in this case) would 'move around'.  This implies you have to

	  <title>Tuning your SCSI kernel setup</title>
	  
	  <para>Experience has shown that some devices are slow to respond to
	    INQUIRY commands after a SCSI bus reset (which happens at boot
	    time).  An INQUIRY command is sent by the kernel on boot to see
	    what kind of device (disk, tape, CD-ROM etc) is connected to a
	    specific target ID.  This process is called device probing by the
	    way.</para>
	      
	  <para>To work around the 'slow response' problem, FreeBSD allows a
	    tunable delay time before the SCSI devices are probed following a
	    SCSI bus reset.  You can set this delay time in your kernel
	    configuration file using a line like:</para>
	      
	  <programlisting>
options         SCSI_DELAY=15         #Be pessimistic about Joe SCSI device</programlisting>

	  <para>This line sets the delay time to 15 seconds.  On my own system
	    I had to use 3 seconds minimum to get my trusty old CD-ROM drive
	    to be recognized.  Start with a high value (say 30 seconds or so)
	    when you have problems  with device recognition.  If this helps,
	    tune it back until it just stays working.</para>

	  <title>Rogue SCSI devices</title>
	      
	  <para>Although the SCSI standard tries to be complete and concise,
	    it is a complex standard and implementing things correctly is no
	    easy task.  Some vendors do a better job then others.</para>
	      
	  <para>This is exactly where the &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; devices come
	    into view. Rogues are devices that are recognized by the FreeBSD
	    kernel as behaving slightly (...) non-standard.  Rogue devices are
	    reported by the kernel when booting.  An example for two of my
	    cartridge tape units:</para>
	  
	  <screen>Feb 25 21:03:34 yedi /kernel: ahb0 targ 5 lun 0: &lt;TANDBERG TDC 3600       -06:&gt;
Feb 25 21:03:34 yedi /kernel: st0: Tandberg tdc3600 is a known rogue

Mar 29 21:16:37 yedi /kernel: aha0 targ 5 lun 0: &lt;ARCHIVE VIPER 150  21247-005&gt;
Mar 29 21:16:37 yedi /kernel: st1: Archive  Viper 150 is a known rogue </screen>
	      
	  <para>For instance, there are devices that respond to all LUNs on a
	    certain target ID, even if they are actually only one device.  It
	    is easy to see that the kernel might be fooled into believing that
	    there are 8 LUNs at that particular target ID. The confusion this
	    causes is left as an exercise to the reader.</para>
	      
	  <para>The SCSI subsystem of FreeBSD recognizes devices with bad
	    habits by looking at the INQUIRY response they send when probed.
	    Because the INQUIRY response also includes the version number of
	    the device  firmware, it is even possible that for different
	    firmware versions different workarounds are used. See e.g.
	    <filename>/sys/scsi/st.c</filename> and
	    <filename>/sys/scsi/scsiconf.c</filename> for more info on how
	    this is done.</para>
	      
	  <para>This scheme works fine, but keep in mind that it of course
	    only works for devices that are known to be weird.  If you are the
	    first to connect your bogus Mumbletech SCSI CD-ROM you might be
	    the one that has to define which workaround is needed.</para>
	      
	  <para>After you got your Mumbletech working, please send the
	    required workaround to the FreeBSD development team for inclusion
	    in the next release of FreeBSD.  Other Mumbletech owners will be
	    grateful  to you.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Multiple LUN devices</title>
	  
	  <para>In some cases you come across devices that use multiple
	    logical units (LUNs) on a single SCSI ID.  In most cases FreeBSD
	    only probes devices for LUN 0.  An example are so called bridge
	    boards that connect 2 non-SCSI harddisks to a SCSI bus (e.g. an
	    Emulex MD21 found in old Sun systems).</para>
	      
	  <para>This means that any devices with LUNs != 0 are not normally
	    found during device probe on system boot.  To work around this
	    problem you must add an appropriate entry in /sys/scsi/scsiconf.c
	    and rebuild your kernel.</para>
	      
	  <para>Look for a struct that is initialized like below:</para>

	  <programlisting>
{
        T_DIRECT, T_FIXED, "MAXTOR", "XT-4170S", "B5A",
        "mx1", SC_ONE_LU
}</programlisting>
	      
	  <para>For you Mumbletech BRIDGE2000 that has more than one LUN, acts
	    as a SCSI disk and has firmware revision 123 you would add
	    something like:</para>
	      
	  <programlisting>
{
        T_DIRECT, T_FIXED, "MUMBLETECH", "BRIDGE2000", "123",
        "sd", SC_MORE_LUS
}</programlisting>
	      
	  <para>The kernel on boot scans the inquiry data it receives against
	    the table and acts accordingly.  See the source for more
	    info.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Tagged command queueing</title>
	  
	  <para>Modern SCSI devices, particularly magnetic disks,
	    support what is called tagged command queuing (TCQ).</para>
	  
	  <para>In a nutshell, TCQ allows the device to have multiple I/O
	    requests outstanding at the same time.  Because the device is
	    intelligent, it can optimise its operations (like head
	    positioning) based on its own request queue.  On  SCSI devices
	    like RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) arrays the TCQ
	    function is indispensable to take advantage of the device's
	    inherent parallelism.</para>
	      
	  <para>Each I/O request is uniquely identified by a &ldquo;tag&rdquo;
	    (hence the name tagged command queuing) and this tag is used by
	    FreeBSD to see which I/O in the device drivers queue is reported
	    as complete by the device.</para>
	      
	  <para>It should be noted however that TCQ requires device driver
	    support and that some devices implemented it &ldquo;not quite
	    right&rdquo; in their firmware.  This problem bit me once, and it
	    leads to highly mysterious problems.  In such cases, try to
	    disable TCQ.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Busmaster host adapters</title>
	  
	  <para>Most, but not all, SCSI host adapters are bus mastering
	    controllers.  This means that they can do I/O on their own without
	    putting load onto the host CPU for data movement.</para>
	      
	  <para>This is of course an advantage for a multitasking operating
	    system like FreeBSD.  It must be noted however that there might be
	    some rough edges.</para>
	      
	  <para>For instance an Adaptec 1542 controller can be set to use
	    different transfer speeds on the host bus (ISA or AT in this
	    case).  The controller is settable to different rates because not
	    all motherboards can handle the higher speeds.  Problems like
	    hangups, bad data etc might be the result of using a higher data
	    transfer rate then your motherboard can stomach.</para>
	      
	  <para>The solution is of course obvious: switch to a lower data
	    transfer rate and try if that works better.</para>
	      
	  <para>In the case of a Adaptec 1542, there is an option that can be
	    put into the kernel config file to allow dynamic determination of
	    the right, read: fastest feasible, transfer rate.  This option is
	    disabled by default:</para>
	      
	  <programlisting>
options        "TUNE_1542"             #dynamic tune of bus DMA speed</programlisting>
	      
	  <para>Check the man pages for the host adapter that you use.  Or
	    better still, use the ultimate documentation (read: driver

	<title>SCSI hard drives</title>
	
	<para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.asami;.  17 February
	    1998.</emphasis></para>
	    
	<para>As mentioned in the <link linkend="scsi">SCSI</link> section,
	  virtually all SCSI hard drives sold today are SCSI-2 compliant and
	  thus will work fine as long as you connect them to a supported SCSI
	  host adapter.  Most problems people encounter are either due to
	  badly designed cabling (cable too long, star topology, etc.),
	  insufficient termination, or defective parts. Please refer to the
	  <link linkend="scsi">SCSI</link> section first if your SCSI hard
	  drive is not working.  However, there are a couple of things you may
	  want to take into account before you purchase SCSI hard drives for
	  your system.</para>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Rotational speed</title>
	  
	  <para>Rotational speeds of SCSI drives sold today range from around
	    4,500RPM to 10,000RPM.  Most of them are either 5,400RPM or
	    7,200RPM.  Even though the 7,200RPM drives can generally transfer
	    data faster, they run considerably hotter than their 5,400RPM
	    counterparts.  A large fraction of today's disk drive malfunctions
	    are heat-related.  If you do not have very good cooling in your PC
	    case, you may want to stick with 5,400RPM or slower drives.</para>
	      
	  <para>Note that newer drives, with higher areal recording densities,
	    can deliver much more bits per rotation than older ones.  Today's
	    top-of-line 5,400RPM drives can sustain a throughput comparable to
	    7,200RPM drives of one or two model generations ago.  The number
	    to find on the spec sheet for bandwidth is &ldquo;internal data
	    (or transfer) rate&rdquo;.  It is usually in megabits/sec so
	    divide it by 8 and you'll get the rough approximation of how much
	    megabytes/sec you can get out of the drive.</para>
	      
	  <para>(If you are a speed maniac and want a 10,000RPM drive for your
	    cute little peecee, be my guest; however, those drives become
	    extremely hot.  Don't even think about it if you don't have a fan
	    blowing air <emphasis>directly at</emphasis> the drive or a
	    properly ventilated disk enclosure.)</para>
	      
	  <para>Obviously, the latest 10,000RPM drives and 7,200RPM drives can
	    deliver more data than the latest 5,400RPM drives, so if absolute
	    bandwidth is the necessity for your applications, you have little
	    choice but to get the faster drives.  Also, if you need low
	    latency, faster drives are better; not only do they usually have
	    lower average seek times, but also the rotational delay is one
	    place where slow-spinning drives can never beat a faster one.
	    (The average rotational latency is half the time it takes to
	    rotate the drive once; thus, it's 3 milliseconds for 10,000RPM
	    drives, 4.2ms for 7,200RPM drives and 5.6ms for 5,400RPM drives.)
	    Latency is seek time plus rotational delay. Make sure you
	    understand whether you need low latency or more accesses per
	    second, though; in the latter case (e.g., news servers), it may
	    not be optimal to purchase one big fast drive.  You can achieve
	    similar or even better results by using the ccd (concatenated
	    disk) driver to create a striped disk array out of multiple slower
	    drives for comparable overall cost.</para>
	      
	  <para>Make sure you have adequate air flow around the drive,
	    especially if you are going to use a fast-spinning drive.  You
	    generally need at least 1/2" (1.25cm) of spacing above and below a
	    drive.  Understand how the air flows through your PC case.  Most
	    cases have the power supply suck the air out of the back.  See
	    where the air flows in, and put the drive where it will have the
	    largest volume of cool air flowing around it. You may need to seal
	    some unwanted holes or add a new fan for effective cooling.</para>
	      
	  <para>Another consideration is noise.  Many 7,200 or faster drives
	    generate a high-pitched whine which is quite unpleasant to most
	    people.  That, plus the extra fans often required for cooling, may
	    make 7,200 or faster drives unsuitable for some office and home
	    environments.</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Form factor</title>
	  
	  <para>Most SCSI drives sold today are of 3.5" form factor.  They
	    come in two different heights; 1.6" (&ldquo;half-height&rdquo;) or
	    1" (&ldquo;low-profile&rdquo;).  The half-height drive is the same
	    height as a CD-ROM drive.  However, don't forget the spacing rule
	    mentioned in the previous section.  If you have three standard
	    3.5" drive bays, you will not be able to put three half-height
	    drives in there (without frying them, that is).</para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4>
	  <title>Interface</title>
	  
	  <para>The majority of SCSI hard drives sold today are Ultra or
	    Ultra-wide SCSI.  The maximum bandwidth of Ultra SCSI is 20MB/sec,
	    and Ultra-wide SCSI is 40MB/sec.  There is no difference in max
	    cable length between Ultra and Ultra-wide; however, the more
	    devices you have on the same bus, the sooner you will start having
	    bus integrity problems.  Unless you have a well-designed disk
	    enclosure, it is not easy to make more than 5 or 6 Ultra SCSI
	    drives work on a single bus.</para>
	      
	  <para>On the other hand, if you need to connect many drives, going
	    for Fast-wide SCSI may not be a bad idea.  That will have the same
	    max bandwidth as Ultra (narrow) SCSI, while electronically it's
	    much easier to get it &ldquo;right&rdquo;.  My advice would be: if
	    you want to connect many disks, get wide SCSI drives; they usually
	    cost a little more but it may save you down the road.  (Besides,
	    if you can't afford the cost difference, you shouldn't be building
	    a disk array.)</para>
	      
	  <para>There are two variant of wide SCSI drives; 68-pin and 80-pin
	    SCA (Single Connector Attach).  The SCA drives don't have a
	    separate 4-pin power connector, and also read the SCSI ID settings
	    through the 80-pin connector.  If you are really serious about
	    building a large storage system, get SCA drives and a good SCA
	    enclosure (dual power supply with at least one extra fan).  They
	    are more electronically sound than 68-pin counterparts because
	    there is no &ldquo;stub&rdquo; of the SCSI bus inside the disk
	    canister as in arrays built from 68-pin drives.  They are easier
	    to install too (you just need to screw the drive in the canister,
	    instead of trying to squeeze in your fingers in a tight place to
	    hook up all the little cables (like the SCSI ID and disk activity
	    LED lines).</para>

      <title>CD-ROM drives</title>
      
      <para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.obrien;.  23 November
	      1997.</emphasis></para>
      
      <para>As mentioned in <link linkend="hw-jordans-picks-cdrom">Jordan's
	  Picks</link> Generally speaking those in <emphasis>The FreeBSD
	  Project</emphasis> prefer SCSI CDROM drives over IDE CDROM drives.
	However not all SCSI CDROM drives are equal.  Some feel the quality of
	some SCSI CDROM drives have been deteriorating to that of IDE CDROM
	drives.  Toshiba used to be the favored stand-by, but many on the SCSI
	mailing list have found displeasure with the 12x speed XM-5701TA as
	its volume (when playing audio CDROMs) is not controllable by the
	various audio player software.</para>
	  
      <para>Another area where SCSI CDROM manufacturers are cutting corners is
	adherence to the <link linkend="scsi-further-reading">SCSI
	  specification</link>. Many SCSI CDROMs will respond to <link
	  linkend="scsi-rogue-devices">multiple LUNs</link> for its target
	address.  Known violators include the 6x Teac CD-56S 1.0D.</para>

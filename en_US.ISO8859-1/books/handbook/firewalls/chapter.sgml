    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Firewalls make it possible to filter
      incoming and outgoing traffic that flows through your system.
      A firewall can use one or more sets of <quote>rules</quote> to
      inspect the network packets as they come in or go out of your
      network connections and either allows the traffic through or
      blocks it.  The rules of a firewall can inspect one or more
      characteristics of the packets, including but not limited to the
      protocol type, the source or destination host address, and the
      source or destination port.</para>

    <para>Firewalls can greatly enhance the security of a host or a
      network.  They can be used to do one or more of
      the following things:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>To protect and insulate the applications, services and
	  machines of your internal network from unwanted traffic
	  coming in from the public Internet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To limit or disable access from hosts of the internal
	  network to services of the public Internet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To support network address translation
	  (<acronym>NAT</acronym>), which allows your internal network
	  to use private <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses and share a
	  single connection to the public Internet (either with a
	  single <acronym>IP</acronym> address or by a shared pool of
	  automatically assigned public addresses).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

    <title>Firewall Concepts</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>rulesets</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>There are two basic ways to create firewall rulesets:
      <quote>inclusive</quote> or <quote>exclusive</quote>.  An
      exclusive firewall allows all traffic through except for the
      traffic matching the ruleset.  An inclusive firewall does the
      reverse.  It only allows traffic matching the rules through and
      blocks everything else.</para>

    <para>An inclusive firewall offers much better control of the outgoing
      traffic, making it a better choice for systems that offer services to
      the public Internet.  It also controls the type of traffic originating
      from the public Internet that can gain access to your private network.
      All traffic that does not match the rules, is blocked and logged by
      design.  Inclusive firewalls are generally safer than exclusive
      firewalls because they significantly reduce the risk of allowing
      unwanted traffic to pass through them.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Unless noted otherwise, all configuration and example
	rulesets in this chapter, create inclusive type firewalls.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Security can be tightened further using a <quote>stateful
	firewall</quote>.  This type of firewall keeps
      track of which connections are opened through the firewall and
      will only allow traffic through which either matches an existing
      connection or opens a new one.  The disadvantage of a stateful
      firewall is that it can be vulnerable to Denial of Service
      (<acronym>DoS</acronym>) attacks if a lot of new connections are
      opened very fast.  With most firewalls it is possible to use a
      combination of stateful and non-stateful behavior to make an
      optimal firewall for the site.</para>

    <title>Firewall Packages</title>

    <para>&os; has three different firewall packages built
      into the base system.  They are: <emphasis>IPFILTER</emphasis>
      (also known as <acronym>IPF</acronym>),
      <emphasis>IPFIREWALL</emphasis> (also known as <acronym>IPFW</acronym>),
      and <emphasis>OpenBSD's PacketFilter</emphasis> (also known as
      <acronym>PF</acronym>).  &os; also has two built in packages for
      traffic shaping (basically controlling bandwidth usage):
      &man.altq.4; and &man.dummynet.4;.  Dummynet has traditionally been
      closely tied with <acronym>IPFW</acronym>, and
      <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> with
      <acronym>PF</acronym>.  Traffic shaping for IPFILTER can currently
      be done with IPFILTER for NAT and filtering and
      <acronym>IPFW</acronym> with &man.dummynet.4;
      <emphasis>or</emphasis> by using <acronym>PF</acronym> with
      <acronym>ALTQ</acronym>.
      IPFW, and PF all use rules to control the access of packets to and
      from your system, although they go about it different ways and
      have a different rule syntax.</para>

    <para>The reason that &os; has multiple built in firewall packages
      is that different people have different requirements and
      preferences.  No single firewall package is the best.</para>

    <para>The author prefers IPFILTER because its stateful rules are
      much less complicated to use in a <acronym>NAT</acronym>
      environment and it has a built in ftp proxy that simplifies the
      rules to allow secure outbound FTP usage.</para>

    <para>Since all firewalls are based on inspecting the values of
      selected packet control fields, the creator of the firewall
      rulesets must have an understanding of how
      <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> works, what the different values in
      the packet control fields are and how these values are used in a
      normal session conversation.  For a good explanation go to:

    <title>The OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF) and
      <acronym>ALTQ</acronym></title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>PF</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>As of July 2003 the OpenBSD firewall software application
      known as <acronym>PF</acronym> was ported to &os; and
      made available in the &os; Ports Collection.  Released in 2004,
      &os;&nbsp;5.3 was the first release that contained
      <acronym>PF</acronym> as an integrated part of the base system.
      <acronym>PF</acronym> is a complete, full-featured firewall
      that has optional support for <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> (Alternate
      Queuing).  <acronym>ALTQ</acronym> provides Quality of Service
      (<acronym>QoS</acronym>) functionality.</para>

    <para>The OpenBSD Project does an outstanding job of
      maintaining the <ulink
	url="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</ulink>.
      As such, this section of the Handbook will focus on
      <acronym>PF</acronym> as it pertains to &os; while providing
      some general information regarding usage.  For detailed usage
      information please refer to the <ulink
	url="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</ulink>.</para>

    <para>More information about <acronym>PF</acronym> for &os;

      <title>Using the PF Loadable Kernel Modules</title>

        <para>To load the PF Kernel Module add the following line to
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

        <programlisting>pf_enable="YES"</programlisting>

        <para>Then run the startup script to load the module:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/pf start</userinput></screen>

	<para>Note that the PF Module will not load if it cannot find
	  the ruleset config file.  The default location is
	  <filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename>.  If the PF ruleset is
	  located somewhere else, PF can be instructed to look there by
	  adding a line like the following to
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

        <programlisting>pf_rules="<replaceable>/path/to/pf.conf</replaceable>"</programlisting>

	<para>The sample <filename>pf.conf</filename>
	  can be found in <filename
	    class="directory">/usr/share/examples/pf/</filename>.
	</para>

      <para>The <acronym>PF</acronym> module can also be loaded manually
  	from the command line:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload pf.ko</userinput></screen>

      <para>Logging support for PF is provided by the
        <literal>pflog.ko</literal> and can be loaded by adding the
	following line to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>pflog_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Then run the startup script to load the module:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/pflog start</userinput></screen>

      <para>If you need other <acronym>PF</acronym> features you will
        need to compile <acronym>PF</acronym> support into the kernel.</para>

      <para>While it is not necessary that you compile
	<acronym>PF</acronym> support into the &os; kernel, you may want
	to do so to take advantage of one of PF's advanced features that
	is not included in the loadable module, namely &man.pfsync.4;, which
	is a pseudo-device that exposes certain changes to
	the state table used by <acronym>PF</acronym>.  It can be
	paired with &man.carp.4; to create failover firewalls using
	<acronym>PF</acronym>.  More information on
	<acronym>CARP</acronym> can be found in
	<xref linkend="carp"> of the Handbook.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>PF</acronym> kernel options can be found in
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> and are reproduced
	below:</para>

      <programlisting>device pf
device pflog
device pfsync</programlisting>

      <para>The <literal>device pf</literal> option enables support for the
	<quote>Packet Filter</quote> firewall (&man.pf.4;).</para>

      <para>The <literal>device pflog</literal> option enables the optional
	&man.pflog.4; pseudo network device which can be used to log
	traffic to a &man.bpf.4; descriptor.  The &man.pflogd.8; daemon
	can be used to store the logging information to disk.</para>

      <para>The <literal>device pfsync</literal> option enables the optional
	&man.pfsync.4; pseudo-network device that is used to monitor
	<quote>state changes</quote>.</para>

      <title>Available <filename>rc.conf</filename> Options</title>

      <para>The following &man.rc.conf.5; statements configure
	<acronym>PF</acronym> and &man.pflog.4; at boot:</para>

      <programlisting>pf_enable="YES"                 # Enable PF (load module if required)
pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"         # rules definition file for pf
pf_flags=""                     # additional flags for pfctl startup
pflog_enable="YES"              # start pflogd(8)
pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog"  # where pflogd should store the logfile
pflog_flags=""                  # additional flags for pflogd startup</programlisting>

      <para>If you have a LAN behind this firewall and have to forward
	packets for the computers on the LAN or want to do NAT, you
	will need the following option as well:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"            # Enable as LAN gateway</programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Creating Filtering Rules</title>

      <para><acronym>PF</acronym> reads its configuration rules from
	&man.pf.conf.5; (<filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename> by
	default) and it modifies, drops, or passes packets according to
	the rules or definitions specified there.  The &os;
	installation includes several sample files located in
	<filename>/usr/share/examples/pf/</filename>.  Please refer to
	the <ulink url="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</ulink>
	for complete coverage of <acronym>PF</acronym> rulesets.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>When browsing the <ulink
	  url="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</ulink>,
	  please keep in mind that different versions of &os; can
	  contain different versions of PF. Currently,
	  &os;&nbsp;8.<replaceable>X</replaceable> and prior is
	  using the same version of <acronym>PF</acronym> as
	  OpenBSD&nbsp;4.1.  &os;&nbsp;9.<replaceable>X</replaceable> and
	  later is using the same version of <acronym>PF</acronym> as
	  OpenBSD&nbsp;4.5.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The &a.pf; is a good place to ask questions about

    <title>The IPFILTER (IPF) Firewall</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>IPFILTER</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The author of IPFILTER is Darren Reed.  IPFILTER is not
      operating system dependent: it is an open source application and
      has been ported to &os;, NetBSD, OpenBSD, &sunos;, HP/UX, and
      &solaris; operating systems.  IPFILTER is actively being
      supported and maintained, with updated versions being released
      regularly.</para>

    <para>IPFILTER is based on a kernel-side firewall and
      <acronym>NAT</acronym> mechanism that can be controlled and
      monitored by userland interface programs.  The firewall rules can
      be set or deleted with the &man.ipf.8; utility.  The
      <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules can be set or deleted with the
      &man.ipnat.1; utility.  The &man.ipfstat.8; utility can print
      run-time statistics for the kernel parts of IPFILTER.  The
      &man.ipmon.8; program can log IPFILTER actions to the system log
      files.</para>

    <para>IPF was originally written using a rule processing logic of
      <quote>the last matching rule wins</quote> and used only
      stateless type of rules.  Over time IPF has been enhanced to
      include a <quote>quick</quote> option and a stateful <quote>keep
	state</quote> option which drastically modernized the rules
      processing logic.  IPF's official documentation covers only the legacy
      rule coding parameters and rule file processing
      logic.  The modernized functions are only included as additional
      options, completely understating their benefits in producing a
      far superior and more secure firewall.</para>

    <para>The instructions contained in this section are based on
      using rules that contain the <quote>quick</quote> option and the
      stateful <quote>keep state</quote> option.  This is the basic
      framework for coding an inclusive firewall ruleset.</para>

      method see: <ulink

      <para>IPF is included in the basic &os; install as a separate run

	kernel loadable module when the <filename>rc.conf</filename> statement
	<literal>ipfilter_enable="YES"</literal> is used.  The loadable
	module was created with logging enabled and the
	<literal>default pass all</literal> options.  There is no need
	to compile IPF into the &os; kernel just to change the default
	to <literal>block all</literal>.  This can be done just by adding
	a <literal>block all</literal> rule at the end of your ruleset.</para>

      <para>One of the most important functions of the

      </indexterm>

      <para>In order for <command>ipmon</command> to work properly, the
	kernel option <literal>IPFILTER_LOG</literal> must be turned on.  This command has
	two different modes that it can be used in.  Native mode is the
	default mode when the command is typed on the command line
	without the <option>-D</option> flag.</para>

      <para>Daemon mode is for when a continuous
	system log file is desired, so that logging of past events may be
	reviewed.  This is how &os; and IPFILTER are configured to
	work together. &os; has a built in facility to automatically
	rotate system logs.  That is why outputting the log information
	to &man.syslogd.8; is better than the default of outputting to a
	regular file.  In the default <filename>rc.conf</filename> file,
	the <literal>ipmon_flags</literal> statement uses the <option>-Ds</option>
	flags:</para>

      <programlisting>ipmon_flags="-Ds" # D = start as daemon
                  # s = log to syslog
                  # v = log tcp window, ack, seq
                  # n = map IP &amp; port to names</programlisting>

      <para>The benefits of logging are obvious.  It provides the
	ability to review, after the fact, information such as which
	packets had been dropped, what addresses they came from and
	where they were going.  These can all provide a significant edge
	in tracking down attackers.</para>

      <para>Even with the logging facility enabled, IPF will not
	generate any rule logging on its own.  The firewall
	administrator decides what rules in the ruleset he wants to
	log and adds the log keyword to those rules.  Normally only
	deny rules are logged.</para>

      <para>It is very customary to include a default deny everything
	rule with the log keyword included as your last rule in the
	ruleset.  This makes it possible to see all the packets that did not
	match any of the rules in the ruleset.</para>

      <title>IPMON Logging</title>

      <para><application>Syslogd</application> uses its own special
	method for segregation of log data.  It uses special groupings
	called <quote>facility</quote> and <quote>level</quote>.  IPMON
	in <option>-Ds</option> mode uses <literal>local0</literal>
	as the <quote>facility</quote>
	name by default.
	The following levels can be
	used to further segregate the logged data if desired:</para>

      <screen>LOG_INFO - packets logged using the "log" keyword as the action rather than pass or block.
LOG_NOTICE - packets logged which are also passed
LOG_WARNING - packets logged which are also blocked
LOG_ERR - packets which have been logged and which can be considered short</screen>

      <!-- XXX: "can be considered short" == "with incomplete header" -->

      <para>To setup IPFILTER to log all data to
	<filename>/var/log/ipfilter.log</filename>, the file will need to be
	created beforehand.  The following command will do that:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch /var/log/ipfilter.log</userinput></screen>

      <para>The &man.syslogd.8; function is controlled by definition statements
	in the <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> file.  The
	<filename>syslog.conf</filename> file offers considerable
	flexibility in how <application>syslog</application> will deal with system messages issued
	by software applications like IPF.</para>

      <para>Add the following statement to
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>local0.* /var/log/ipfilter.log</programlisting>

      <para>The <literal>local0.*</literal>
	means to write all the logged messages to the coded
	file location.</para>

      <para>To activate the changes to <filename>/etc/syslog.conf
	</filename> you can reboot or bump the &man.syslogd.8; daemon into

	flags.</para>

      <para>If the packet is an ICMP packet, there will be two fields

      <title>Building the Rule Script with Symbolic
	Substitution</title>

      <para>Some experienced IPF users create a file containing the
	rules and code them in a manner compatible with running them as
	a script with symbolic substitution.  The major benefit of
	doing this is that only the value associated
	with the symbolic name needs to be changed, and when the script is run all the rules
	containing the symbolic name will have the value substituted in
	the rules.  Being a script, symbolic substitution can be used
	to code frequently used values and substitute them in multiple
	rules.  This can be seen in the following example.</para>

      <para>The script syntax used here is compatible with the &man.sh.1;, &man.csh.1;,
	and &man.tcsh.1; shells.</para>

      <para>Symbolic substitution fields are prefixed with a dollar
	sign: <literal>&dollar;</literal>.</para>

      <para>Symbolic fields do not have the &dollar; prefix.</para>

      <title>IPF Rulesets</title>

      <para>A ruleset is a group of IPF rules coded to pass or block
	packets based on the values contained in the packet.  The
	bi-directional exchange of packets between hosts comprises a
	session conversation.  The firewall ruleset processes both the
	packets arriving from the public Internet, as well as the packets
	produced by the system as a response to them.
	Each <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> service (i.e.: telnet, www,
	mail, etc.) is predefined by its protocol and privileged (listening)
	port.  Packets destined for a specific service, originate from the
	source address using an unprivileged (high order) port and target the
	specific service port on the destination address.  All the above
	parameters (i.e.: ports and addresses) can be used as selection
	criteria to create rules which will pass or block services.</para>

	<para><literal>on</literal> indicates the interface name to be

	  are as displayed by &man.ifconfig.8;.  Using this option, the
	  rule will only match if the packet is going through that
	  interface in the specified direction (in/out).  This option
	  is a mandatory requirement for the modernized rules
	  processing logic.</para>

	<para>When a packet is logged, the headers of the packet are

	  Immediately following the <literal>log</literal> keyword, the following

	<para><literal>first</literal> If the <literal>log</literal>

	<title>SELECTION</title>

	<para>The keywords described in this section are used to
	  describe attributes of the packet to be checked when
	  determining whether rules match or not.  There is a
	  keyword subject, and it has sub-option keywords, one of
	  which has to be selected.  The following general-purpose
	  attributes are provided for matching, and must be used in
	  this order:</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>PROTO</title>

	<para><literal>proto</literal> is the subject keyword and must
	  be coded along with one of its corresponding keyword
	  sub-option values.  The value allows a specific protocol to
	  be matched against.  This option is a mandatory requirement
	  for the modernized rules processing logic.</para>

	<para><literal>tcp/udp | udp | tcp | icmp</literal> or any
	  protocol names found in <filename>/etc/protocols</filename>
	  are recognized and may be used.  The special protocol keyword
	  <literal>tcp/udp</literal> may be used to match either a
	  <acronym>TCP</acronym> or a <acronym>UDP</acronym> packet, and has been added as
	  a convenience to save duplication of otherwise identical
	  rules.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>SRC_ADDR/DST_ADDR</title>

	<para>The <literal>all</literal> keyword is essentially a
	  synonym for <quote>from any to any</quote> with no other
	  match parameters.</para>

	<para><literal>from src to dst</literal>: the <literal>from</literal> and <literal>to</literal>
	  keywords are used to match against IP addresses.  Rules must
	  specify <emphasis>both</emphasis> source and destination parameters.
	  <literal>any</literal> is a special keyword that matches any
	  IP address.  Examples of use: <literal>from any to any</literal>
	  or <literal>from 0.0.0.0/0 to any</literal> or <literal>from any to
	    0.0.0.0/0</literal> or <literal>from 0.0.0.0 to any</literal> or
	  <literal>from any to 0.0.0.0</literal>.</para>


	<para>There is no way to match ranges of IP addresses which
	  do not express themselves easily using the dotted numeric
	  form / mask-length notation.  The <filename
	    role="package">net-mgmt/ipcalc</filename> port may be used to
	  ease up the calculations.  Additional information is available in

	<title>PORT</title>

	<para>If a port match is included, for either or both of source
	  and destination, then it is only applied to
	  <acronym>TCP</acronym> and <acronym>UDP</acronym> packets.  When composing port
	  comparisons, either the service name from
	  <filename>/etc/services</filename> or an integer port number
	  may be used.  When the port appears as part of the <literal>from</literal>
	  object, it matches the source port number; when it appears
	  as part of the <literal>to</literal> object, it matches the destination port
	  number.  The use of the port option with the
	  <literal>to</literal> object is a mandatory requirement for
	  the modernized rules processing logic.  Example of use:
	  <literal>from any to any port = 80</literal></para>

	<!-- XXX: Rewritten, but probably needs more changes -->

	<para>Single port comparisons may be done in a number of ways, using
	  a number of different comparison operators.  Port ranges may also be

      <!-- XXX: duplicated -->

      <para>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
	exchange of packets comprising a session conversation.  When
	activated, keep-state dynamically generates internal rules for
	each anticipated packet being exchanged during the
	bi-directional session conversation.  It has sufficient matching
	capabilities to determine if the session conversation between the
	originating sender and the destination are following the valid
	procedure of bi-directional packet exchange.  Any packets that
	do not properly fit the session conversation template are
	automatically rejected as impostors.</para>

      <para>Keep state will also allow <acronym>ICMP</acronym> packets related to a
	<acronym>TCP</acronym> or <acronym>UDP</acronym> session through.  So if you get
	<acronym>ICMP</acronym> type 3 code 4 in response to some web surfing allowed out
	by a keep state rule, they will be automatically allowed in.
	Any packet that IPF can be certain is part of an active
	session, even if it is a different protocol, will be let
	in.</para>

      <para>What happens is:</para>

      <para>Packets destined to go out through the interface connected to the
	public Internet are first checked against the dynamic state
	table.  If the packet matches the next expected packet
	comprising an active session conversation, then it exits the
	firewall and the state of the session conversation flow is
	updated in the dynamic state table.  Packets that do not belong to
	an already active session, are simply checked against the outbound
	ruleset.</para>

      <para>Packets coming in from the interface connected to the public
	Internet are first checked against the dynamic state table.  If
	the packet matches the next expected packet comprising an
	active session conversation, then it exits the firewall and
	the state of the session conversation flow is updated in the
	dynamic state table.  Packets that do not belong to an already active
	session, are simply checked against the inbound ruleset.</para>

      <para>When the conversation completes it is removed from the
	dynamic state table.</para>

      <para>Stateful filtering allows you to focus on blocking/passing
	new sessions.  If the new session is passed, all its subsequent
	packets will be allowed through automatically and any impostors
	automatically rejected.  If a new session is blocked, none of
	its subsequent packets will be allowed through.  Stateful
	filtering has technically advanced matching abilities
	capable of defending against the flood of different attack
	methods currently employed by attackers.</para>

      <title>Inclusive Ruleset Example</title>

      <para>The following ruleset is an example of how to code a very
	secure inclusive type of firewall.  An inclusive firewall only
	allows services matching <literal>pass</literal> rules through, and blocks all
	others by default.  Firewalls intended to protect other machines,
	also called <quote>network firewalls</quote>, should have at least
	two interfaces, which are generally configured to trust one side
	(the <acronym>LAN</acronym>) and not the other (the public Internet).  Alternatively,
	a firewall might be configured to protect only the system it is
	running on&mdash;this is called a
	<quote>host based firewall</quote>, and is particularly appropriate
	for servers on an untrusted network.</para>

      <para>All &unix; flavored systems including &os; are designed to
	use interface <devicename>lo0</devicename> and IP address
	<hostid role="ipaddr">127.0.0.1</hostid> for internal
	communication within the operating system.  The firewall rules
	must contain rules to allow free unmolested movement of these
	special internally used packets.</para>

      <para>The interface which faces the public Internet is the one
	to place the rules that authorize and control access of the outbound
	and inbound connections.  This can be your user PPP
	<devicename>tun0</devicename> interface or your NIC that is
	connected to your DSL or cable modem.</para>

      <para>In cases where one or more NICs are cabled to private network
	segments, those interfaces may require rules to allow packets
	originating from those LAN interfaces transit to each other and/or
	to the outside (Internet).</para>

      <para>The rules should be organized into three major
	sections: first trusted interfaces, then the public
	interface outbound, and last the public untrusted interface inbound.</para>

      <para>The rules in each of the public interface sections should
	have the most frequently matched rules placed before less
	commonly matched rules, with the last rule in the section
	blocking and logging all packets on that interface and
	direction.</para>

      <para>The Outbound section in the following ruleset only
	contains <literal>pass</literal> rules which contain selection values that
	uniquely identify the service that is authorized for public
	Internet access.  All the rules have the <literal>quick</literal>, <literal>on</literal>,
	<literal>proto</literal>, <literal>port</literal>, and <literal>keep state</literal> options set.  The <literal>proto
	tcp</literal> rules have the <literal>flag</literal> option included to identify the
	session start request as the triggering packet to activate the
	stateful facility.</para>

      <para>The Inbound section has all the blocking of undesirable
	packets first, for two different reasons.  The first is that
	malicious packets may be partial matches for legitimate traffic.
	These packets have to be discarded rather than allowed in, based on
	their partial matches against <literal>allow</literal> rules.
	The second reason is that known and uninteresting rejects may be
	blocked silently, rather than being caught and logged by the last
	rules in the section.  The final rule in each section, blocks and
	logs all packets and can be used to create the legal evidence needed
	to prosecute the people who are attacking your system.</para>

      <para>Another thing that should be taken care of, is to ensure there is no
	response returned for any of the undesirable traffic.  Invalid
	packets should just get dropped and vanish.  This way the attacker
	has no knowledge if his packets have reached your system.  The
	less the attackers can learn about your system, the more
	time they must invest before actually doing something bad.
	Rules that include a <literal>log first</literal> option, will only
	log the event the first time they are triggered.  This option is
	included in the sample <literal>nmap OS fingerprint</literal> rule.
	The <filename role="package">security/nmap</filename> utility is
	commonly used by attackers who attempt to identify the operating
	system of your server.</para>

      <para>Any time there are logged messages on a rule with
	the <literal>log first</literal> option, an <command>ipfstat -hio</command>
	command should be executed to evaluate how many times the rule has
	actually matched.  Large number of matches usually indicate that the
	system is being flooded (i.e.: under attack).</para>

      <para>The <filename>/etc/services</filename> file may be used to
	lookup unknown port numbers.  Alternatively,
	visit <ulink
	  url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"></ulink>
	and do a port number lookup to find the purpose of a particular
	port number.</para>

      <para>Check out this link for port numbers used by Trojans <ulink
	  url="http://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/oddports.php"></ulink>.</para>

      <para>The following ruleset creates a complete and very secure
	<literal>inclusive</literal> type of firewall ruleset that has been
	tested on production systems.  It can be easily modified for your
	own system.  Just comment out any <literal>pass</literal> rules for
	services that should not be authorized.</para>

      <para>To avoid logging unwanted messages,
	just add a <literal>block</literal> rule in the inbound section.</para>

      <para>The <devicename>dc0</devicename> interface name has to be changed
	in every rule to the real interface name of the NIC
	card that connects your system to the public Internet.  For
	user PPP it would be <devicename>tun0</devicename>.</para>

      <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> stands for <emphasis>Network Address
	  Translation</emphasis>.  To those familiar with &linux;, this concept is
	called IP Masquerading; <acronym>NAT</acronym> and IP
	Masquerading are the same thing.  One of the many things the
	IPF <acronym>NAT</acronym> function enables is the ability to
	have a private Local Area Network (LAN) behind the firewall
	sharing a single ISP assigned IP address on the public
	Internet.</para>

      <para>You may ask why would someone want to do this.  ISPs
	normally assign a dynamic IP address to their non-commercial
	users.  Dynamic means that the IP address can be different each
	time you dial in and log on to your ISP, or for cable and DSL
	modem users, when the modem is power cycled.  This dynamic IP
	address is used to identify your system to the public Internet.</para>

      <para>Now lets say you have five PCs at home and each one needs
	Internet access.  You would have to pay your ISP for an
	individual Internet account for each PC and have five phone
	lines.</para>

      <para>With <acronym>NAT</acronym> only a single account is needed
	with your ISP.  The other four PCs may then be cabled to a switch and
	the switch to the NIC in your &os; system which is going to
	service your LAN as a gateway. <acronym>NAT</acronym> will
	automatically translate the private LAN IP address for each
	separate PC on the LAN to the single public IP address as it
	exits the firewall bound for the public Internet.  It also does
	the reverse translation for returning packets.</para>

      <para>There is a special range of IP addresses reserved for
	<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed private LANs.  According to
	RFC 1918, the following IP ranges may be used for private nets
	which will never be routed directly to the public
	Internet:</para>

      <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> rules are very flexible and can
	accomplish many different things to fit the needs of commercial
	and home users.</para>

      <para>The rule syntax presented here has been simplified to what
	is most commonly used in a non-commercial environment.  For a
	complete rule syntax description see the &man.ipnat.5; manual
	page.</para>

      <para>The syntax for a <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule looks
	something like this:</para>

      <programlisting>map <replaceable>IF</replaceable> <replaceable>LAN_IP_RANGE</replaceable> -&gt; <replaceable>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>The keyword <literal>map</literal> starts the rule.</para>

      <para>Replace <replaceable>IF</replaceable> with the external
	interface.</para>

      <para>The <replaceable>LAN_IP_RANGE</replaceable> is what your
	internal clients use for IP Addressing, usually this is
	something like <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.0/24</hostid>.</para>

      <para>The <replaceable>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</replaceable> can either
	be the external IP address or the special keyword

      <title>How <acronym>NAT</acronym> works</title>

      <para>A packet arrives at the firewall from the LAN with a public
	destination.  It passes through the outbound filter rules,
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> gets its turn at the packet and applies
	its rules top down, first matching rule wins.
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> tests each of its rules against the
	packet's interface name and source IP address.  When a packet's
	interface name matches a <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule then the
	source IP address (i.e.: private LAN IP address) of the packet
	is checked to see if it falls within the IP address range
	specified to the left of the arrow symbol on the
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> rule.  On a match the packet has its
	source IP address rewritten with the public IP address
	obtained by the <literal>0/32</literal> keyword.
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> posts an entry in its internal
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> table so when the packet returns from
	the public Internet it can be mapped back to its original
	private IP address and then passed to the filter rules for
	processing.</para>

      <title><acronym>NAT</acronym> for a Large LAN</title>

      <para>For networks that have large numbers of PC's on the LAN or
	networks with more than a single LAN, the process of funneling
	all those private IP addresses into a single public IP address
	becomes a resource problem that may cause problems with the
	same port numbers being used many times across many
	<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed LAN PC's, causing collisions.  There
	are two ways to relieve this resource problem.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Assigning Ports to Use</title>

	<!-- What does it mean ? Is there something missing ?-->
	<!-- XXXBLAH <- Apparently you can't start a sect
	     with a <programlisting> tag ?-->

	<para>A normal NAT rule would look like:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32</programlisting>

	<para>In the above rule the packet's source port is unchanged
	  as the packet passes through IP<acronym>NAT</acronym>.  By
	  adding the <literal>portmap</literal> keyword,
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> can be directed to only use source ports in the specified range.
	  For example the following rule will tell
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> to modify the source port to be
	  within the range shown:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 20000:60000</programlisting>

	<para>Additionally we can make things even easier by using the
	  <literal>auto</literal> keyword to tell
	  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> to determine by itself which ports
	  are available to use:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp auto</programlisting>

	<title>Using a Pool of Public Addresses</title>

	<para>In very large LANs there comes a point where there are just too
	  many LAN addresses to fit into a single public address.  If a block
	  of public IP addresses is available, these addresses can be used as
	  a <quote>pool</quote>, and IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> may pick one of
	  the public IP addresses as packet-addresses are mapped on their way
	  out.</para>

	<para>For example, instead of mapping all packets through a single
	  public IP address, as in:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 204.134.75.1</programlisting>

	<para>A range of public IP addresses can be specified either with a
	  netmask:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 204.134.75.0/255.255.255.0</programlisting>

	<para>or using CIDR notation:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 204.134.75.0/24</programlisting>

      <title>Port Redirection</title>

      <para>A very common practice is to have a web server, email
	server, database server and DNS server each segregated to a
	different PC on the LAN.  In this case the traffic from these
	servers still have to be <acronym>NAT</acronym>ed, but there
	has to be some way to direct the inbound traffic to the
	correct LAN PCs.  IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> has the redirection
	facilities of <acronym>NAT</acronym> to solve this problem.
	For example, assuming a web server operating on LAN address <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.0.10.25</hostid> and using a single public IP
	address of <hostid role="ipaddr">20.20.20.5</hostid> the rule would
	be coded as follows:</para>

	<programlisting>rdr dc0 20.20.20.5/32 port 80 -&gt; 10.0.10.25 port 80</programlisting>

	<para>or:</para>

	<programlisting>rdr dc0 0.0.0.0/0 port 80 -&gt; 10.0.10.25 port 80</programlisting>

	<para>or for a LAN DNS Server on LAN address of <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">10.0.10.33</hostid> that needs to receive
	  public DNS requests:</para>

	<programlisting>rdr dc0 20.20.20.5/32 port 53 -&gt; 10.0.10.33 port 53 udp</programlisting>

      <title>FTP and <acronym>NAT</acronym></title>

      <para>FTP is a dinosaur left over from the time before the
	Internet as it is known today, when research universities were
	leased lined together and FTP was used to share files among
	research Scientists.  This was a time when data security was
	not a consideration.  Over the years the FTP protocol became
	buried into the backbone of the emerging Internet and its
	username and password being sent in clear text was never
	changed to address new security concerns.  FTP has two flavors,
	it can run in active mode or passive mode.  The difference is
	in how the data channel is acquired.  Passive mode is more
	secure as the data channel is acquired by the ordinal ftp
	session requester.  For a real good explanation of FTP and the
	different modes see <ulink
	  url="http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html"></ulink>.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> Rules</title>

	<para>IP<acronym>NAT</acronym> has a special built in FTP proxy
	  option which can be specified on the <acronym>NAT</acronym>
	  map rule.  It can monitor all outbound packet traffic for FTP
	  active or passive start session requests and dynamically
	  create temporary filter rules containing only the port number
	  really in use for the data channel.  This eliminates the
	  security risk FTP normally exposes the firewall to from
	  having large ranges of high order port numbers open.</para>

	<para>This rule will handle all the traffic for the internal
	  LAN:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp</programlisting>

	<para>This rule handles the FTP traffic from the
	  gateway:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 0.0.0.0/0 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp</programlisting>

	<para>This rule handles all non-FTP traffic from the internal
	  LAN:</para>

	<programlisting>map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32</programlisting>

	<para>The FTP map rule goes before our regular map rule.  All
	  packets are tested against the first rule from the top.
	  Matches on interface name, then private LAN source IP
	  address, and then is it a FTP packet.  If all that matches
	  then the special FTP proxy creates temp filter rules to let
	  the FTP session packets pass in and out, in addition to also
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ing the FTP packets.  All LAN packets
	  that are not FTP do not match the first rule and fall
	  through to the third rule and are tested, matching on
	  interface and source IP, then are
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ed.</para>

    <para>The IPFIREWALL (<acronym>IPFW</acronym>) is a &os; sponsored firewall software
      application authored and maintained by &os; volunteer staff
      members.  It uses the legacy stateless rules and a legacy rule
      coding technique to achieve what is referred to as Simple
      Stateful logic.</para>

    <para>The IPFW sample ruleset (found in
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall6</filename>) in the standard &os;
      install is rather simple and it is not expected to be used
      directly without modifications.  The example does not use
      stateful filtering, which is beneficial in most setups, so it
      will not be used as base for this section.</para>

    <para>The IPFW stateless rule syntax is empowered with technically
      sophisticated selection capabilities which far surpasses the
      knowledge level of the customary firewall installer.  IPFW is
      targeted at the professional user or the advanced technical
      computer hobbyist who have advanced packet selection
      requirements.  A high degree of detailed knowledge into how
      different protocols use and create their unique packet header
      information is necessary before the power of the IPFW rules can
      be unleashed.  Providing that level of explanation is out of the
      scope of this section of the Handbook.</para>

    <para>IPFW is composed of seven components, the primary component
      is the kernel firewall filter rule processor and its integrated
      packet accounting facility, the logging facility, the <literal>divert</literal>
      rule which triggers the <acronym>NAT</acronym> facility, and the
      advanced special purpose facilities, the dummynet traffic shaper
      facilities, the <literal>fwd rule</literal> forward facility, the bridge
      facility, and the ipstealth facility.  IPFW supports both IPv4
      and IPv6.</para>

      <para>A ruleset is a group of IPFW rules coded to allow or deny
	packets based on the values contained in the packet.  The
	bi-directional exchange of packets between hosts comprises a
	session conversation.  The firewall ruleset processes both the
	packets arriving from the public Internet, as well as the packets
	originating from the system as a response to them.
	Each <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> service (i.e.: telnet, www,
	mail, etc.) is predefined by its protocol and privileged (listening)
	port.  Packets destined for a specific service, originate from the
	source address using an unprivileged (high order) port and target
	the specific service port on the destination address.  All the above
	parameters (i.e., ports and addresses) can be used as selection
	criteria to create rules which will pass or block services.</para>

      <para>When a packet enters the firewall it is compared against
	the first rule in the ruleset and progresses one rule at a time
	moving from top to bottom of the set in ascending rule number
	sequence order.  When the packet matches the selection parameters

	  see the &man.ipfw.8; manual page.</para>

	<para>Rules contain keywords: these keywords have to be coded
	  in a specific order from left to right on the line.  Keywords
	  are identified in bold type.  Some keywords have sub-options
	  which may be keywords them selves and also include more
	  sub-options.</para>

	<para><literal>#</literal> is used to mark the start of a

	  <title>ACTION</title>

	  <para>A rule can be associated with one of the following
	    actions, which will be executed when the packet matches
	    the selection criterion of the rule.</para>

	  <para><parameter>allow | accept | pass |
	      permit</parameter></para>

	  <para>These all mean the same thing which is to allow packets
	    that match the rule to exit the firewall rule processing.
	    The search terminates at this rule.</para>

	  <para><parameter>check-state</parameter></para>

	  <para>Checks the packet against the dynamic rules table.  If
	    a match is found, execute the action associated with the
	    rule which generated this dynamic rule, otherwise move to
	    the next rule.  The check-state rule does not have
	    selection criterion.  If no check-state rule is present in
	    the ruleset, the dynamic rules table is checked at the
	    first keep-state or limit rule.</para>

	  <para><parameter>deny | drop</parameter></para>

	  <para>Both words mean the same thing which is to discard
	    packets that match this rule.  The search
	    terminates.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Logging</title>

	  <para><parameter>log</parameter> or
	    <parameter>logamount</parameter></para>

	  <para>When a packet matches a rule with the <literal>log</literal> keyword, a
	    message will be logged to &man.syslogd.8; with a facility name of
	    SECURITY.  The logging only occurs if the number of
	    packets logged so far for that particular rule does not
	    exceed the <literal>logamount</literal> parameter.  If no <literal>logamount</literal> is
	    specified, the limit is taken from the sysctl variable
	    <literal>net.inet.ip.fw.verbose_limit</literal>.  In both cases, a value of
	    zero removes the logging limit.  Once the limit is
	    reached, logging can be re-enabled by clearing the
	    logging counter or the packet counter for that rule, see
	    the <command>ipfw reset log</command> command.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Logging is done after
	      all other packet matching conditions have been
	      successfully verified, and before performing the final
	      action (accept, deny) on the packet.  It is up to you to
	      decide which rules you want to enable logging on.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Selection</title>

	  <para>The keywords described in this section are used to
	    describe attributes of the packet to be checked when
	    determining whether rules match the packet or not.
	    The following general-purpose attributes are provided for
	    matching, and must be used in this order:</para>

	  <para><parameter>udp | tcp | icmp</parameter></para>

	  <para>Any other protocol names found in
	    <filename>/etc/protocols</filename> are also recognized and may
	    be used.  The value specified is the protocol to be matched
	    against.  This is a mandatory requirement.</para>

	  <para><parameter>from src to dst</parameter></para>

	  <para>The <literal>from</literal> and <literal>to</literal> keywords are used to match against IP
	    addresses.  Rules must specify <emphasis>both</emphasis> source and destination
	    parameters. <literal>any</literal> is a special keyword
	    that matches any IP address. <literal>me</literal> is a
	    special keyword that matches any IP address configured on
	    an interface in your &os; system to represent the PC the
	    firewall is running on (i.e.: this box) as in <literal>from me to
	      any</literal> or <literal>from any to me</literal> or <literal>from 0.0.0.0/0 to any</literal> or
	    <literal>from any to 0.0.0.0/0</literal> or <literal>from 0.0.0.0 to any</literal> or <literal>from
	    any to 0.0.0.0</literal> or <literal>from me to 0.0.0.0</literal>.  IP addresses are
	    specified as a dotted IP address numeric form/mask-length (CIDR notation),
	    or as single dotted IP address numeric form.  This is a
	    mandatory requirement.  The <filename
	      role="package">net-mgmt/ipcalc</filename> port may be used to
	    ease up the calculations.  Additional
	    information is available in the utility's web page: <ulink
	      url="http://jodies.de/ipcalc"></ulink>.</para>

	  <para><parameter>port number</parameter></para>

	  <para>For protocols which support port numbers (such as
	    <acronym>TCP</acronym> and <acronym>UDP</acronym>), it is mandatory to
	    code the port number of the service that will be matched.
	    Service names (from
	    <filename>/etc/services</filename>) may be used instead of
	    numeric port values.</para>

	  <para><parameter>in | out</parameter></para>

	  <para>Matches incoming or outgoing packets, respectively.
	    The <literal>in</literal> and <literal>out</literal> are keywords and it is mandatory that
	    one or the other is coded as part of your rule matching
	    criterion.</para>

	  <para><parameter>via IF</parameter></para>

	  <para>Matches packets going through the interface specified
	    by exact name.  The <literal>via</literal> keyword causes
	    the interface to always be checked as part of the match
	    process.</para>

	  <para><parameter>setup</parameter></para>

	  <para>This is a mandatory keyword that identifies the session
	    start request for <acronym>TCP</acronym> packets.</para>

	  <para><parameter>keep-state</parameter></para>

	  <para>This is a mandatory keyword.  Upon a match, the
	    firewall will create a dynamic rule, whose default behavior
	    is to match bidirectional traffic between source and
	    destination IP/port using the same protocol.</para>

	  <para><parameter>limit {src-addr | src-port | dst-addr |
	      dst-port}</parameter></para>

	  <para>The firewall will only allow
	    <replaceable>N</replaceable> connections with the same set
	    of parameters as specified in the rule.  One or more of
	    source and destination addresses and ports can be

	  <secondary>stateful filtering</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<!-- XXX: duplicated -->

	<para>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
	  exchange of packets comprising a session conversation.  It
	  has the matching capabilities to determine if the session
	  conversation between the originating sender and the
	  destination are following the valid procedure of
	  bi-directional packet exchange.  Any packets that do not
	  properly fit the session conversation template are
	  automatically rejected as impostors.</para>

	<para>The <literal>check-state</literal> option is used to identify where in the IPFW rules
	  set the packet is to be tested against the dynamic rules
	  facility.  On a match the packet exits the firewall to
	  continue on its way and a new rule is dynamically created for
	  the next anticipated packet being exchanged during this
	  bi-directional session conversation.  On a no match the
	  packet advances to the next rule in the ruleset for
	  testing.</para>

	<para>The dynamic rules facility is vulnerable to resource
	  depletion from a SYN-flood attack which would open a huge
	  number of dynamic rules.  To counter this attack, &os;
	  added another new option named <literal>limit</literal>.  This
	  option is used to limit the number of simultaneous session
	  conversations by checking the rules source or
	  destinations fields as directed by the <literal>limit</literal> option and
	  using the packet's IP address found there, in a search of
	  the open dynamic rules counting the number of times this
	  rule and IP address combination occurred, if this count is
	  greater that the value specified on the <literal>limit</literal> option, the
	  packet is discarded.</para>

	<title>Logging Firewall Messages</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>IPFW</primary>

	  <secondary>logging</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>The benefits of logging are obvious: it provides the
	  ability to review after the fact the rules you activated
	  logging on which provides information like, what packets had
	  been dropped, what addresses they came from and where they were
	  going, giving you a significant edge in tracking down
	  attackers.</para>

	<para>Even with the logging facility enabled, IPFW will not
	  generate any rule logging on it's own.  The firewall
	  administrator decides what rules in the ruleset will be
	  logged, and adds the <literal>log</literal> verb to those rules.  Normally only
	  deny rules are logged, like the deny rule for incoming
	  <acronym>ICMP</acronym> pings.  It is very customary to
	  duplicate the <quote>ipfw default deny everything</quote> rule with the
	  <literal>log</literal> verb included as your last rule in the ruleset.  This
	  way it is possible to see all the packets that did not match any
	  of the rules in the ruleset.</para>

	<para>Logging is a two edged sword, if you are not careful, you
	  can lose yourself in the over abundance of log data and fill
	  your disk up with growing log files.  DoS attacks that fill
	  up disk drives is one of the oldest attacks around.  These
	  log messages are not only written to <application>syslogd</application>, but also are
	  displayed on the root console screen and soon become very
	  annoying.</para>

	<para>The <literal>IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=5</literal>
	  kernel option limits the number of consecutive messages
	  sent to the system logger &man.syslogd.8;, concerning the packet
	  matching of a given rule.  When this option is enabled in
	  the kernel, the number of consecutive messages concerning
	  a particular rule is capped at the number specified.  There
	  is nothing to be gained from 200 log messages saying the
	  same identical thing.  For instance, five consecutive
	  messages concerning a particular rule would be logged to
	  <application>syslogd</application>, the remainder identical consecutive messages would
	  be counted and posted to <application>syslogd</application> with a phrase like
	  the following:</para>

	<programlisting>last message repeated 45 times</programlisting>

	<para>All logged packets messages are written by default to
	  <filename>/var/log/security</filename> file, which is defined
	  in the <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> file.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="firewalls-ipfw-rules-script">
	<title>Building a Rule Script</title>

	<para>Most experienced IPFW users create a file containing the
	  rules and code them in a manner compatible with running them
	  as a script.  The major benefit of doing this is the firewall
	  rules can be refreshed in mass without the need of rebooting
	  the system to activate them.  This method is very
	  convenient in testing new rules as the procedure can be
	  executed as many times as needed.  Being a script,
	  symbolic substitution can be used to code frequent used values and
	  substitute them in multiple rules.  This is shown in
	  the following example.</para>

	<para>The script syntax used here is compatible with the &man.sh.1;,
	  &man.csh.1;, &man.tcsh.1; shells.  Symbolic substitution fields are
	  prefixed with a dollar sign &dollar;.  Symbolic fields do not
	  have the &dollar; prefix.  The value to populate the symbolic
	  field must be enclosed in "double quotes".</para>

	<title>Stateful Ruleset</title>

	<para>The following non-<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed ruleset is an
	  example of how to code a very secure 'inclusive' type of
	  firewall.  An inclusive firewall only allows services
	  matching pass rules through and blocks all other by default.
	  Firewalls designed to protect entire network segments, have at minimum two interfaces which must
	  have rules to allow the firewall to function.</para>

	<para>All &unix; flavored operating systems, &os; included, are
	  designed to use interface <devicename>lo0</devicename> and IP
	  address <hostid role="ipaddr">127.0.0.1</hostid> for internal
	  communication with in the operating system.  The firewall
	  rules must contain rules to allow free unmolested movement of
	  these special internally used packets.</para>

	<para>The interface which faces the public Internet is the one
	  to place the rules that authorize and control access of the
	  outbound and inbound connections.  This can be your user
	  <acronym>PPP</acronym>
	  <devicename>tun0</devicename> interface or your NIC that is
	  connected to your DSL or cable modem.</para>

	<para>In cases where one or more than one NICs are connected to
	  a private LAN behind the firewall, those interfaces must
	  have rules coded to allow free unmolested movement of
	  packets originating from those LAN interfaces.</para>

	<para>The rules should be first organized into three major
	  sections, all the free unmolested interfaces, public
	  interface outbound, and the public interface inbound.</para>

	<para>The order of the rules in each of the public interface
	  sections should be in order of the most used rules being
	  placed before less often used rules with the last rule in
	  the section blocking and logging all packets on that interface
	  and direction.</para>

	<para>The Outbound section in the following ruleset only
	  contains <literal>allow</literal> rules which contain selection values that
	  uniquely identify the service that is authorized for public
	  Internet access.  All the rules have the <literal>proto</literal>, <literal>port</literal>,
	  <literal>in/out</literal>, <literal>via</literal> and <literal>keep state</literal> option coded.  The <literal>proto tcp</literal>
	  rules have the <literal>setup</literal> option included to identify the start
	  session request as the trigger packet to be posted to the
	  keep state stateful table.</para>

	<para>The Inbound section has all the blocking of undesirable
	  packets first, for two different reasons.  The first is that
	  malicious packets may be partial matches for legitimate traffic.
	  These packets have to be discarded rather than allowed in, based on
	  their partial matches against <literal>allow</literal> rules.
	  The second reason is that known and uninteresting rejects may be
	  blocked silently, rather than being caught and logged by the last
	  rules in the section.  The final rule in each section, blocks and
	  logs all packets and can be used to create the legal evidence needed
	  to prosecute the people who are attacking your system.</para>

	<para>Another thing that should be taken care of, is to insure there
	  is no response returned for any of the undesirable stuff.  Invalid
	  packets should just get dropped and vanish.  This way the attacker
	  has no knowledge if his packets have reached your system.
	  The less the attackers can learn about your system, the more
	  secure it is.  Packets with unrecognized port numbers may be looked
	  up in <filename>/etc/services/</filename> or go to <ulink
	    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"></ulink>
	  and do a port number lookup to find the purpose of the particular
	  port number is.  Check out this link for port numbers used by
	  Trojans: <ulink
	    url="http://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/oddports.php"></ulink>.</para>

	<title>An Example Inclusive Ruleset</title>

	<para>The following non-<acronym>NAT</acronym>ed ruleset is a
	  complete inclusive type ruleset.  It is safe to use this ruleset
	  on your own systems.  Just comment out any <literal>pass</literal>
	  rules for services that are not required.  To avoid logging
	  undesired messages, add a <literal>deny</literal> rule in the
	  inbound section.  The <devicename>dc0</devicename> interface will
	  have to be changed in every rule, with the actual name of the
	  interface (NIC) that connects your system to the public Internet.
	  For user <acronym>PPP</acronym>, this would be
	  <devicename>tun0</devicename>.</para>

	<title>An Example <acronym>NAT</acronym> and Stateful
	  Ruleset</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>NAT</primary>

	  <secondary>and IPFW</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>There are some additional configuration statements that
	  need to be enabled to activate the <acronym>NAT</acronym>
	  function of IPFW.  The kernel source needs <literal>option IPDIVERT</literal>
	  statement added to the other IPFIREWALL statements compiled
	  into a custom kernel.</para>

	<para>In addition to the normal IPFW options in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the following are
	  needed.</para>

	<programlisting>natd_enable="YES"                   # Enable <acronym>NAT</acronym>D function
natd_interface="rl0"                # interface name of public Internet NIC
natd_flags="-dynamic -m"            # -m = preserve port numbers if possible</programlisting>

	<para>Utilizing stateful rules with <literal>divert natd</literal> rule (Network
	  Address Translation) greatly complicates the ruleset coding
	  logic.  The positioning of the <literal>check-state</literal>, and <literal>divert natd</literal>
	  rules in the ruleset becomes very critical.  This is no
	  longer a simple fall-through logic flow.  A new action type
	  is used, called <literal>skipto</literal>.  To use the <literal>skipto</literal> command it is
	  mandatory that each rule is numbered, so the
	  <literal>skipto</literal> rule number knows exactly where it is jumping
	  to.</para>

	<para>The following is an uncommented example of one coding
	  method, selected here to explain the sequence of the packet
	  flow through the rulesets.</para>

	<para>The processing flow starts with the first rule from the
	  top of the rule file and progress one rule at a time deeper
	  into the file until the end is reached or the packet being
	  tested to the selection criteria matches and the packet is
	  released out of the firewall.  It is important to take notice
	  of the location of rule numbers 100 101, 450, 500, and 510.
	  These rules control the translation of the outbound and
	  inbound packets so their entries in the keep-state dynamic
	  table always register the private LAN IP address.  Next
	  notice that all the allow and deny rules specify the
	  direction the packet is going (i.e.: outbound or inbound) and
	  the interface.  Also notice that the start outbound
	  session requests, all <literal>skipto rule 500</literal> for the network address
	  translation.</para>

	<para>Lets say a LAN user uses their web browser to get a web
	  page.  Web pages are transmitted over port 80.  So the
	  packet enters the firewall.  It does not match rule 100 because it
	  is headed out rather than  in.  It passes rule 101 because this is the
	  first packet, so it has not been posted to the keep-state
	  dynamic table yet.  The packet finally comes to rule 125 a
	  matches.  It is outbound through the NIC facing the public
	  Internet.  The packet still has it's source IP address as a
	  private LAN IP address.  On the match to this rule, two
	  actions take place.  The <literal>keep-state</literal> option will post this
	  rule into the keep-state dynamic rules table and the
	  specified action is executed.  The action is part of the info
	  posted to the dynamic table.  In this case it is <literal>skipto rule
	  500</literal>.  Rule 500 <acronym>NAT</acronym>s the packet IP address
	  and out it goes.  Remember this, this is very important.
	  This packet makes its way to the destination, where a response
	  packet is generated and sent back.  This new packet
	  enters the top of the ruleset.  This time it does match rule
	  100 and has it destination IP address mapped back to its
	  corresponding LAN IP address.  It then is processed by the
	  <literal>check-state</literal> rule, it is found in the table as an existing
	  session conversation and released to the LAN.  It goes to the
	  LAN PC that sent it and a new packet is sent requesting
	  another segment of the data from the remote server.  This
	  time it gets checked by the <literal>check-state</literal> rule and its outbound
	  entry is found,  the associated action, <literal>skipto 500</literal>, is
	  executed.  The packet jumps to rule 500 gets
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ed and released on it's way out.</para>

	<para>On the inbound side, everything coming in that is part
	  of an existing session conversation is being automatically
	  handled by the <literal>check-state</literal> rule and the properly placed
	  <literal>divert natd</literal> rules.  All we have to address is denying all the
	  bad packets and only allowing in the authorized services.
	  Lets say there is an apache server running on the firewall box
	  and we want people on the public Internet to be able to
	  access the local web site.  The new inbound start request
	  packet matches rule 100 and its IP address is mapped to LAN
	  IP for the firewall box.  The packet is then matched against
	  all the nasty things that need to be checked for and finally matches
	  against rule 425.  On a match two things occur.  The packet
	  rule is posted to the keep-state dynamic table but this time
	  any new session requests originating from that source IP
	  address is limited to 2.  This defends against DoS attacks of
	  service running on the specified port number.  The action is
	  <literal>allow</literal> so the packet is released to the LAN.
	  The packet generated as a response, is recognized by the
	  <literal>check-state</literal> as belonging to an
	  existing session conversation.  It is then sent to rule 500 for
	  <acronym>NAT</acronym>ing and released to the outbound
	  interface.</para>

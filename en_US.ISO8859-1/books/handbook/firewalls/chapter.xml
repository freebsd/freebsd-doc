    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>Firewalls make it possible to filter the incoming and
      outgoing traffic that flows through a system.  A firewall can
      use one or more sets of <quote>rules</quote> to inspect network
      packets as they come in or go out of network connections and
      either allows the traffic through or blocks it.  The rules of
      a firewall can inspect one or more characteristics of the
      packets such as the protocol type, source or destination host
      address, and source or destination port.</para>

    <para>Firewalls can enhance the security of a host or a network.
      They can be used to do one or more of the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

    <para>&os; has three firewalls built into the base system:
      <application>PF</application>, <application>IPFW</application>,
      and <application>IPFILTER</application>, also known as
      <application>IPF</application>.  &os; also provides two traffic
      shapers for controlling bandwidth usage: &man.altq.4; and
      &man.dummynet.4;.  <application>ALTQ</application> has
      traditionally been closely tied with
      <application>PF</application> and
      <application>dummynet</application> with
      <application>IPFW</application>.  Each firewall uses rules to
      control the access of packets to and from a &os; system,
      although they go about it in different ways and each has a
      different rule syntax.</para>

    <para>&os; provides multiple firewalls in order to meet the
      different requirements and preferences for a wide variety of
      users.  Each user should evaluate which firewall best meets
      their needs.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Since all firewalls are based on inspecting the values of
	selected packet control fields, the creator of the firewall
	ruleset must have an understanding of how
	<acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> works, what the different values in
	the packet control fields are, and how these values are used
	in a normal session conversation.  For a good introduction,

    <indexterm>
      <primary>firewall</primary>

      <secondary>rulesets</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>A ruleset contains a group of rules which pass or block
      packets based on the values contained in the packet.  The
      bi-directional exchange of packets between hosts comprises a
      session conversation.  The firewall ruleset processes both the
      packets arriving from the public Internet, as well as the
      packets produced by the system as a response to them.  Each
      <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> service is predefined by its protocol
      and listening port.  Packets destined for a specific service
      originate from the source address using an unprivileged port and
      target the specific service port on the destination address.
      All the above parameters can be used as selection criteria to
      create rules which will pass or block services.</para>

    <para>To lookup unknown port numbers, refer to
      <filename>/etc/services</filename>.  Alternatively, visit <uri
	xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers</uri>
      and do a port number lookup to find the purpose of a particular
      port number.</para>

    <para>Check out this link for port numbers used by Trojans <uri
	xlink:href="http://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/oddports.php">http://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/oddports.php</uri>.</para>

    <para>FTP has two modes:  active mode and passive mode.  The
      difference is in how the data channel is acquired.  Passive
      mode is more secure as the data channel is acquired by the
      ordinal ftp session requester.  For a good explanation of FTP
      and the different modes, see <uri
	xlink:href="http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html">http://www.slacksite.com/other/ftp.html</uri>.</para>

    <para>A firewall ruleset can be either
      <quote>exclusive</quote> or <quote>inclusive</quote>.  An
      exclusive firewall allows all traffic through except for the
      traffic matching the ruleset.  An inclusive firewall does the
      reverse as it only allows traffic matching the rules through and
      blocks everything else.</para>

    <para>An inclusive firewall offers better control of the outgoing
      traffic, making it a better choice for systems that offer
      services to the public Internet.  It also controls the type of
      traffic originating from the public Internet that can gain
      access to a private network.  All traffic that does not match
      the rules is blocked and logged.  Inclusive firewalls are
      generally safer than exclusive firewalls because they
      significantly reduce the risk of allowing unwanted
      traffic.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Unless noted otherwise, all configuration and example
	rulesets in this chapter create inclusive firewall
	rulesets.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Security can be tightened further using a <quote>stateful
	firewall</quote>.  This type of firewall keeps track of open
      connections and only allows traffic which either matches an
      existing connection or opens a new, allowed connection.</para>

    <para>Stateful filtering treats traffic as a bi-directional
      exchange of packets comprising a session.  When state is
      specified on a matching rule the firewall dynamically generates
      internal rules for each anticipated packet being exchanged
      during the session.  It has sufficient matching capabilities to
      determine if a packet is valid for a session.  Any packets that
      do not properly fit the session template are automatically
      rejected.</para>

    <para>When the session completes, it is removed from the dynamic
      state table.</para>

    <para>Stateful filtering allows one to focus on blocking/passing
      new sessions.  If the new session is passed, all its subsequent
      packets are allowed automatically and any impostor packets are
      automatically rejected.  If a new session is blocked, none of
      its subsequent packets are allowed.  Stateful filtering provides
      advanced matching abilities capable of defending against the
      flood of different attack methods employed by attackers.</para>

    <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> stands for <emphasis>Network
	Address Translation</emphasis>.  <acronym>NAT</acronym>
      function enables the private LAN behind the firewall to share a
      single ISP-assigned IP address, even if that address is
      dynamically assigned.  NAT allows each computer in the LAN to
      have Internet access, without having to pay the ISP for multiple
      Internet accounts or IP addresses.</para>

    <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> will automatically translate the
      private LAN IP address for each system on the LAN to the
      single public IP address as packets exit the firewall bound for
      the public Internet.  It also performs the reverse translation
      for returning packets.</para>

    <para>According to RFC 1918, the following IP address ranges are
      reserved for private networks which will never be routed
      directly to the public Internet, and therefore are available
      for use with NAT:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>10.0.0.0/8</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>192.168.0.0/16</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <warning>
      <para>When working with the firewall rules, be <emphasis>very
	  careful</emphasis>.  Some configurations <emphasis>can
	  lock the administrator out</emphasis> of the server.  To be
	on the safe side, consider performing the initial firewall
	configuration from the local console rather than doing it
	remotely over <application>ssh</application>.</para>

    <para>Since &os;&nbsp;5.3, a ported version of OpenBSD's
      <application>PF</application> firewall has been included as an
      integrated part of the base system.
      <application>PF</application> is a complete, full-featured
      firewall that has optional support for
      <application>ALTQ</application> (Alternate Queuing), which
      provides Quality of Service (<acronym>QoS</acronym>).</para>

    <para>The OpenBSD Project maintains the definitive reference for
      <application>PF</application> in the <link
	xlink:href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</link>.
      Peter Hansteen maintains a thorough
      <application>PF</application> tutorial at <link
	xlink:href="http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/">http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/</link>.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>When reading the <link
	  xlink:href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">PF FAQ</link>,
	keep in mind that &os; uses the same version of
	<application>PF</application> as OpenBSD&nbsp;4.5.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>The &a.pf; is a good place to ask questions about
      configuring and running the <application>PF</application>
      firewall.  Check the mailing list archives before asking a
      question as it may have already been answered.</para>

    <para>More information about porting <application>PF</application>
      to &os; can be found at <uri
	xlink:href="http://pf4freebsd.love2party.net/">http://pf4freebsd.love2party.net/</uri>.</para>

    <para>This section of the Handbook focuses on
      <application>PF</application> as it pertains to &os;.  It
      demonstrates how to enable <application>PF</application> and
      <application>ALTQ</application>.  It then provides several
      examples for creating rulesets on a &os; system.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling <application>PF</application></title>

      <para>In order to use <application>PF</application>, its kernel
	module must be first loaded.  This section describes the
	entries that can be added to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	in order to enable <application>PF</application>.</para>

      <para>Start by adding the following line to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>pf_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Additional options, described in &man.pfctl.8;, can be
	passed to <application>PF</application> when it is started.
	Add this entry to  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and
	specify any required flags between the two quotes
	(<literal>""</literal>):</para>

      <programlisting>pf_flags=""                     # additional flags for pfctl startup</programlisting>

      <para><application>PF</application> will not start if it cannot
	find its ruleset configuration file.  The default ruleset is
	already created and is named
	<filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename>.  If a custom ruleset has
	been saved somewhere else, add a line to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> which specifies the full
	path to the file:</para>

      <programlisting>pf_rules="<replaceable>/path/to/pf.conf</replaceable>"</programlisting>

      <para>Logging support for <application>PF</application> is
	provided by &man.pflog.4;.  To enable logging support, add
	this line to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>pflog_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>The following lines can also be added in order to
	change the default location of the log file or to specify any
	additional flags to pass to &man.pflog.4; when it is
	started:</para>

      <programlisting>pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog"  # where pflogd should store the logfile
pflog_flags=""                  # additional flags for pflogd startup</programlisting>

      <para>Finally, if there is a <acronym>LAN</acronym> behind the
	firewall and packets need to be forwarded for the computers on
	the <acronym>LAN</acronym>, or <acronym>NAT</acronym> is
	required, add the following option:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"            # Enable as LAN gateway</programlisting>

      <para>After saving the needed edits,
	<application>PF</application> can be started with logging
	support by typing:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service pf start</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>service pflog start</userinput></screen>

      <para>This section demonstrates how to create a customized
	ruleset.  It starts with the simplest of rulesets and builds
	upon its concepts using several examples to demonstrate
	real-world usage of <application>PF</application>'s many
	features.</para>

      <para>The simplest possible ruleset is for a single machine
	that does not run any services and which needs access to one
	network, which may be the Internet.  To create this minimal
	ruleset, edit <filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename> so it looks
	like this:</para>

      <programlisting>block in all
pass out all keep state</programlisting>

      <para>The first rule denies all incoming traffic by default.
	The second rule allows connections created by this system to
	pass out, while retaining state information on those
	connections.  This state information allows return traffic for
	those connections to pass back and should only be used on
	machines that can be trusted.  The ruleset can be loaded
	with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -e ; pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>In addition to keeping state,
	<application>PF</application> provides
	<firstterm>lists</firstterm> and
	<firstterm>macros</firstterm> which can be defined for use
	when creating rules.  Macros can include lists and need to be
	defined before use.  As an example, insert these lines at the
	very top of the ruleset:</para>

      <programlisting>tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, pop3s }"
udp_services = "{ domain }"</programlisting>

      <para><application>PF</application> understands port names as
	well as port numbers, as long as the names are listed in
	<filename>/etc/services</filename>.  This example creates two
	macros.  The first is a list of seven
	<acronym>TCP</acronym> port names and the second is one
	<acronym>UDP</acronym> port name.  Once defined, macros can be
	used in rules.  In this example, all traffic is blocked except
	for the  connections initiated by this system for the seven
	specified <acronym>TCP</acronym> services and the one
	specified <acronym>UDP</acronym> service:</para>

      <programlisting>tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, pop3s }"
udp_services = "{ domain }"
block all
pass out proto tcp to any port $tcp_services keep state
pass proto udp to any port $udp_services keep state</programlisting>

      <para>Even though <acronym>UDP</acronym> is considered to be a
	stateless protocol, <application>PF</application> is able to
	track some state information.  For example, when a
	<acronym>UDP</acronym> request is passed which asks a name
	server about a domain name, <application>PF</application> will
	watch for the response in order to pass it back.</para>

      <para>Whenever an edit is made to a ruleset, the new rules must
	be loaded so they can be used:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>If there are no syntax errors, <command>pfctl</command>
	will not output any messages during the rule load.  Rules can
	also be tested before attempting to load them:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>Including <option>-n</option> causes the rules to be
	interpreted only, but not loaded.  This provides an
	opportunity to correct any errors.  At all times, the last
	valid ruleset loaded will be enforced until either
	<application>PF</application> is disabled or a new ruleset is
	loaded.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Adding <option>-v</option> to a <command>pfctl</command>
	  ruleset verify or load will display the fully parsed rules
	  exactly the way they will be loaded.  This is extremely
	  useful when debugging rules.</para>
      </tip>

      <sect3 xml:id="pftut-gateway">
	<title>A Simple Gateway with NAT</title>

	<para>This section demonstrates how to configure a &os; system
	  running <application>PF</application> to act as a gateway
	  for at least one other machine.  The gateway needs at least
	  two network interfaces, each connected to a separate
	  network.  In this example, <filename>xl1</filename> is
	  connected to the Internet and <filename>xl0</filename> is
	  connected to the internal network.</para>

	<para>First, enable the gateway in order to let the machine
	  forward the network traffic it receives on one interface to
	  another interface.  This <application>sysctl</application>
	  setting will forward <acronym>IPv4</acronym> packets:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1</userinput></screen>

	<para>To forward <acronym>IPv6</acronym> traffic, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1</userinput></screen>

	<para>To enable these settings at system boot, add the
	  following to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"		#for ipv4
ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"	#for ipv6</programlisting>

	<para>Verify with <command>ifconfig</command> that both of the
	  interfaces are up and running.</para>

	<para>Next, create the <application>PF</application> rules to
	  allow the gateway to pass traffic.  While the following rule
	  allows stateful traffic to pass from the Internet  to hosts
	  on the network, the <literal>to</literal> keyword does not
	  guarantee passage all the way from source to
	  destination:</para>

	<programlisting>pass in on xl1 from xl1:network to xl0:network port $ports keep state</programlisting>

	<para>That rule only lets the traffic pass in to the gateway
	  on the internal interface.  To let the packets go further, a
	  matching rule is needed:</para>

	<programlisting>pass out on xl0 from xl1:network to xl0:network port $ports keep state</programlisting>

	<para>While these two rules will work, rules this specific are
	  rarely needed.  For a busy network admin, a readable ruleset
	  is a safer ruleset.  The remainder of this section
	  demonstrates how to keep the rules as simple as possible for
	  readability.  For example, those two rules could be
	  replaced with one rule:</para>

	<programlisting>pass from xl1:network to any port $ports keep state</programlisting>

	<para>The <literal>interface:network</literal> notation can be
	  replaced with a macro to make the ruleset even more
	  readable.  For example, a <literal>$localnet</literal> macro
	  could be defined as the network directly attached to the
	  internal interface (<literal>$xl1:network</literal>).
	  Alternatively, the definition of
	  <literal>$localnet</literal> could be changed to an
	  <emphasis>IP address/netmask</emphasis> notation to denote
	  a network, such as <literal>192.168.100.1/24</literal> for a
	  subnet of private addresses.</para>

	<para>If required, <literal>$localnet</literal> could even be
	  defined as a list of networks.  Whatever the specific needs,
	  a sensible <literal>$localnet</literal> definition could be
	  used in a typical pass rule as follows:</para>

	<programlisting>pass from $localnet to any port $ports keep state</programlisting>

	<para>The following sample ruleset allows all traffic
	  initiated by machines on the internal network.  It first
	  defines two macros to represent the external and internal
	  3COM interfaces of the gateway.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>For dialup users, the external interface will use
	    <filename>tun0</filename>.  For an
	    <acronym>ADSL</acronym> connection, specifically those
	    using <acronym>PPP</acronym> over Ethernet
	    (<acronym>PPPoE</acronym>), the correct external
	    interface is <filename>tun0</filename>, not the physical
	    Ethernet interface.</para>
	</note>

	<programlisting>ext_if = "xl0"	# macro for external interface - use tun0 for PPPoE
int_if = "xl1"	# macro for internal interface
localnet = $int_if:network
# ext_if IP address could be dynamic, hence ($ext_if)
nat on $ext_if from $localnet to any -&gt; ($ext_if)
block all
pass from { lo0, $localnet } to any keep state</programlisting>

	<para>This ruleset introduces the <literal>nat</literal> rule
	  which is used to handle the network address translation from
	  the non-routable addresses inside the internal network to
	  the <acronym>IP</acronym> address assigned to the external
	  interface.  The parentheses surrounding the last part of the
	  nat rule <literal>($ext_if)</literal> is included when the
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address of the external interface is
	  dynamically assigned.  It ensures that network traffic runs
	  without serious interruptions even if the external
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address changes.</para>

	<para>Note that this ruleset probably allows more traffic to
	  pass out of the network than is needed.  One reasonable
	  setup could create this macro:</para>

	<programlisting>client_out = "{ ftp-data, ftp, ssh, domain, pop3, auth, nntp, http, \
    https, cvspserver, 2628, 5999, 8000, 8080 }"</programlisting>

	<para>to use in the main pass rule:</para>

	<programlisting>pass inet proto tcp from $localnet to any port $client_out \
    flags S/SA keep state</programlisting>

	<para>A few other pass rules may be needed.  This one enables
	  <acronym>SSH</acronym> on the external interface::</para>

	<programlisting>pass in inet proto tcp to $ext_if port ssh</programlisting>

	<para>This macro definition and rule allows
	  <acronym>DNS</acronym> and <acronym>NTP</acronym> for
	  internal clients:</para>

	<programlisting>udp_services = "{ domain, ntp }"
pass quick inet proto { tcp, udp } to any port $udp_services keep state</programlisting>

	<para>Note the <literal>quick</literal> keyword in this rule.
	  Since the ruleset consists of several rules, it is important
	  to understand the relationships between the rules in a
	  ruleset.  Rules are evaluated from top to bottom, in the
	  sequence they are written.  For each packet or connection
	  evaluated by <application>PF</application>,
	  <emphasis>the last matching rule</emphasis> in the ruleset
	  is the one which is applied.  However, when a packet matches
	  a rule which contains the <literal>quick</literal> keyword,
	  the rule processing stops and the packet is treated
	  according to that rule.  This is very useful when an
	  exception to the general rules is needed.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="pftut-ftp">
	<title>Creating an <acronym>FTP</acronym> Proxy</title>

	<para>Configuring working <acronym>FTP</acronym> rules can be
	  problematic due to the nature of the <acronym>FTP</acronym>
	  protocol.  <acronym>FTP</acronym> pre-dates firewalls by
	  several decades and is insecure in its design.  The most
	  common points against using <acronym>FTP</acronym>
	  include:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Passwords are transferred in the clear.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The protocol demands the use of at least two
	      <acronym>TCP</acronym> connections (control and data) on
	      separate ports.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>When a session is established, data is communicated
	      using randomly selected ports.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>All of these points present security challenges, even
	  before considering any potential security weaknesses in
	  client or server software.  More secure alternatives for
	  file transfer exist, such as &man.sftp.1; or &man.scp.1;,
	  which both feature authentication and data transfer over
	  encrypted connections..</para>

	<para>For those situations when <acronym>FTP</acronym> is
	  required, <application>PF</application> provides
	  redirection of <acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic to a small
	  proxy program called &man.ftp-proxy.8;, which is included in
	  the base system of &os;.  The role of the proxy is to
	  dynamically insert and delete rules in the ruleset, using a
	  set of anchors, in order to correctly handle
	  <acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic.</para>

	<para>To enable the <acronym>FTP</acronym> proxy, add this
	  line to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>ftpproxy_enable="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>Then start the proxy by running <command>service
	    ftp-proxy start</command>.</para>

	<para>For a basic configuration, three elements need to be
	  added to <filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename>.  First, the
	  anchors which the proxy will use to insert the rules it
	  generates for the <acronym>FTP</acronym> sessions:</para>

	<programlisting>nat-anchor "ftp-proxy/*"
rdr-anchor "ftp-proxy/*"</programlisting>

	<para>Second, a pass rule is needed to allow
	  <acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic in to the proxy.</para>

	<para>Third, redirection and <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules need
	  to be defined before the filtering rules.  Insert this
	  <literal>rdr</literal> rule immediately after the
	  <literal>nat</literal> rule:</para>

	<programlisting>rdr pass on $int_if proto tcp from any to any port ftp -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8021</programlisting>

	<para>Finally, allow the redirected traffic to pass:</para>

	<programlisting>pass out proto tcp from $proxy to any port ftp</programlisting>

	<para>where <literal>$proxy</literal> expands to the address
	  the proxy daemon is bound to.</para>

	<para>Save <filename>/etc/pf.conf</filename>, load the new
	  rules, and verify from a client that <acronym>FTP</acronym>
	  connections are working:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</userinput></screen>

	<para>This example covers a basic setup where the clients in
	  the local network need to contact <acronym>FTP</acronym>
	  servers elsewhere.  This basic configuration should
	  work well with most combinations of <acronym>FTP</acronym>
	  clients and servers.  As shown in &man.ftp-proxy.8;, the
	  proxy's behavior can be changed in various ways by adding
	  options to the <literal>ftpproxy_flags=</literal> line.
	  Some clients or servers may have specific quirks that must
	  be compensated for in the configuration, or there may be a
	  need to integrate the proxy in specific ways such as
	  assigning <acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic to a specific
	  queue.</para>

	<para>For ways to run an <acronym>FTP</acronym> server
	  protected by <application>PF</application> and
	  &man.ftp-proxy.8;, configure a separate
	  <command>ftp-proxy</command> in reverse mode, using
	  <option>-R</option>, on a separate port with its own
	  redirecting pass rule.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="pftut-icmp">
	<title>Managing <acronym>ICMP</acronym></title>

	<para>Many of the tools used for debugging or troubleshooting
	  a <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> network rely on the Internet
	  Control Message Protocol (<acronym>ICMP</acronym>), which
	  was designed specifically with debugging in mind.</para>

	<para>The <acronym>ICMP</acronym> protocol sends and receives
	  <emphasis>control messages</emphasis> between hosts and
	  gateways, mainly to provide feedback to a sender about any
	  unusual or difficult conditions enroute to the target host.
	  Routers use <acronym>ICMP</acronym> to negotiate packet
	  sizes and other transmission parameters in a process often
	  referred to as <emphasis>path <acronym>MTU</acronym>
	    discovery</emphasis>.</para>

	<para>From a firewall perspective, some
	  <acronym>ICMP</acronym> control messages are vulnerable to
	  known attack vectors.  Also, letting all diagnostic traffic
	  pass unconditionally makes debugging easier, but it also
	  makes it easier for others to extract information about the
	  network.  For these reasons, the following rule may not be
	  optimal:</para>

	<programlisting>pass inet proto icmp from any to any</programlisting>

	<para>One solution is to let all <acronym>ICMP</acronym>
	  traffic from the local network through while stopping all
	  probes from outside the network:</para>

	<programlisting>pass inet proto icmp from $localnet to any keep state
pass inet proto icmp from any to $ext_if keep state</programlisting>

	<para>Additional options are available which demonstrate some
	  of <application>PF</application>'s flexibility.  For
	  example, rather than allowing all <acronym>ICMP</acronym>
	  messages, one can specify the messages used by &man.ping.8;
	  and &man.traceroute.8;.  Start by defining a macro for that
	  type of message:</para>

	<programlisting>icmp_types = "echoreq"</programlisting>

	<para>and a rule which uses the macro:</para>

	<programlisting>pass inet proto icmp all icmp-type $icmp_types keep state</programlisting>

	<para>If other types of <acronym>ICMP</acronym> packets are
	  needed, expand <literal>icmp_types</literal> to a list of
	  those packet types.  Type <command>more
	    /usr/src/contrib/pf/pfctl/pfctl_parser.c</command> to see
	  the list of <acronym>ICMP</acronym> message types supported
	  by <application>PF</application>.  Refer to <link
	      xlink:href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml">http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml</link>
	  for an explanation of each message type.</para>

	<para>Since Unix <command>traceroute</command> uses
	  <acronym>UDP</acronym> by default, another rule is needed to
	  allow Unix <command>traceroute</command>:</para>

	<programlisting># allow out the default range for traceroute(8):
pass out on $ext_if inet proto udp from any to any port 33433 &gt;&lt; 33626 keep state</programlisting>

	<para>Since <command>TRACERT.EXE</command> on Microsoft
	  Windows systems uses <acronym>ICMP</acronym> echo request
	  messages, only the first rule is needed to allow network
	  traces from those systems.  Unix
	  <command>traceroute</command> can be instructed to use other
	  protocols as well, and will use <acronym>ICMP</acronym> echo
	  request messages if <option>-I</option> is used.  Check the
	  &man.traceroute.8; man page for details.</para>

	<sect4 xml:id="pftut-pathmtudisc">
	  <title>Path <acronym>MTU</acronym> Discovery</title>

	  <para>Internet protocols are designed to be device
	    independent, and one consequence of device independence is
	    that the optimal packet size for a given connection cannot
	    always be predicted reliably.  The main constraint on
	    packet size is the <firstterm>Maximum Transmission
	      Unit</firstterm> (<acronym>MTU</acronym>) which sets the
	    upper limit on the packet size for an interface.  Type
	    <command>ifconfig</command> to view the
	    <acronym>MTU</acronym>s for a system's network
	    interfaces.</para>

	  <para><acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> uses a process known as path
	    <acronym>MTU</acronym> discovery to determine the right
	    packet size for a connection.  This process sends packets

	    flag set, expecting an <acronym>ICMP</acronym> return
	    packet of <quote>type 3, code 4</quote> when the upper
	    limit has been reached.  Type 3 means <quote>destination
	      unreachable</quote>, and code 4 is short for
	    <quote>fragmentation needed, but the do-not-fragment flag
	      is set</quote>.  To allow path MTU discovery in order

	    add the <literal>destination unreachable</literal> type to
	    the <literal>icmp_types</literal> macro:</para>

	  <programlisting>icmp_types = "{ echoreq, unreach }"</programlisting>

	  <para>Since the pass rule already uses that macro, it does

	  <para><application>PF</application> allows filtering on all

	<title>Using Tables</title>

	<para>Some types of data are relevant to filtering and
	  redirection at a given time, but their definition is too
	  long to be included in the ruleset file.
	  <application>PF</application> supports the use of tables,
	  which are defined lists that can be manipulated without
	  needing to reload the entire ruleset, and which can provide
	  fast lookups.  Table names are always enclosed within
	  <literal>&lt; &gt;</literal>, like this:</para>

	<programlisting>table &lt;clients&gt; { 192.168.2.0/24, !192.168.2.5 }</programlisting>

	<para>In this example, the <literal>192.168.2.0/24</literal>
	  network is part of the table, except for the address
	  <literal>192.168.2.5</literal>, which is excluded using the
	  <literal>!</literal> operator.  It is also possible to load
	  tables from files where each item is on a separate line, as
	  seen in this example
	  <filename>/etc/clients</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>192.168.2.0/24
!192.168.2.5</programlisting>

	<para>To refer to the file, define the table like this:</para>

	<programlisting>table &lt;clients&gt; persist file "/etc/clients"</programlisting>

	<para>Once the table is defined, it can be referenced by a
	  rule:</para>

	<programlisting>pass inet proto tcp from &lt;clients&gt; to any port $client_out flags S/SA keep state</programlisting>

	<para>A table's contents can be manipulated live, using
	  <command>pfctl</command>.  This example adds another network
	  to the table:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -t clients -T add 192.168.1.0/16</userinput></screen>

	<para>Note that any changes made this way will take affect
	  now, making them ideal for testing, but will not survive a
	  power failure or reboot.  To make the changes permanent,
	  modify the definition of the table in the ruleset or edit
	  the file that the table refers to.  One can maintain the
	  on-disk copy of the table using a &man.cron.8; job which
	  dumps the table's contents to disk at regular intervals,
	  using a command such as <command>pfctl -t clients -T show
	    &gt;/etc/clients</command>.  Alternatively,
	  <filename>/etc/clients</filename> can be updated with the
	  in-memory table contents:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -t clients -T replace -f /etc/clients</userinput></screen>

	<title>Using Overload Tables to Protect
	  <acronym>SSH</acronym></title>

	<para>Those who run <acronym>SSH</acronym> on an external
	  interface have probably seen something like this in the
	  authentication logs:</para>

	<programlisting>Sep 26 03:12:34 skapet sshd[25771]: Failed password for root from 200.72.41.31 port 40992 ssh2

	<para>This is indicative of a brute force attack where
	  somebody or some program is trying to discover the user name
	  and password which will let them into the system.</para>

	<para>If external <acronym>SSH</acronym> access is needed for
	  legitimate users, changing the default port used by
	  <acronym>SSH</acronym> can offer some protection.  However,
	  <application>PF</application> provides a more elegant
	  solution.  Pass rules can contain limits on what connecting
	  hosts can do and violators can be banished to a table of
	  addresses which are denied some or all access.  It is even
	  possible to drop all existing connections from machines
	  which overreach the limits.</para>

	<para>To configure this, create this table in the tables
	  section of the ruleset:</para>

	<programlisting>table &lt;bruteforce&gt; persist</programlisting>

	<para>Then, somewhere early in the ruleset, add rules to block
	  brute access while allowing legitimate access:</para>

	<programlisting>block quick from &lt;bruteforce&gt;
pass inet proto tcp from any to $localnet port $tcp_services \
    flags S/SA keep state \
    (max-src-conn <replaceable>100</replaceable>, max-src-conn-rate <replaceable>15/5</replaceable>, \
    overload &lt;bruteforce&gt; flush global)</programlisting>

	<para>The part in parentheses defines the limits and the
	  numbers should be changed to meet local requirements.  It
	  can be read as follows:</para>

	<para><literal>max-src-conn</literal> is the number of
	  simultaneous connections allowed from one host.</para>

	<para><literal>max-src-conn-rate</literal> is the rate of new
	  connections allowed from any single host
	  (<replaceable>15</replaceable>) per number of seconds
	  (<replaceable>5</replaceable>).</para>

	<para><literal>overload &lt;bruteforce&gt;</literal> means
	  that any host which exceeds these limits gets its address
	  added to the <literal>bruteforce</literal> table.  The
	  ruleset blocks all traffic from addresses in the
	  <literal>bruteforce</literal> table.</para>

	<para>Finally, <literal>flush global</literal> says that when
	  a host reaches the limit, that all
	  (<literal>global</literal>) of that host's connections will
	  be terminated (<literal>flush</literal>).</para>

	<note>
	  <para>These rules will <emphasis>not</emphasis> block slow
	    bruteforcers, as described in <link
	      xlink:href="http://home.nuug.no/~peter/hailmary2013/">http://home.nuug.no/~peter/hailmary2013/</link>.</para>
	</note>

	<para>This example ruleset is intended mainly as an
	  illustration.  For example, if a generous number of
	  connections in general are wanted, but the desire is to be
	  more restrictive when it comes to
	  <application>ssh</application>, supplement the rule above
	  with something like the one below, early on in the rule
	  set:</para>

	<programlisting>pass quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to any port ssh \
    flags S/SA keep state \
    (max-src-conn 15, max-src-conn-rate 5/3, \
    overload &lt;bruteforce&gt; flush global)</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <title>It May Not be Necessary to Block All
	    Overloaders</title>

	  <para>It is worth noting that the overload mechanism is a
	    general technique which does not apply exclusively to
	    <acronym>SSH</acronym>, and it is not always optimal to
	    entirely block all traffic from offenders.</para>

	  <para>For example, an overload rule could be used to
	    protect a mail service or a web service, and the overload
	    table could be used in a rule to assign offenders to a
	    queue with a minimal bandwidth allocation or to redirect
	    to a specific web page.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Over time, tables will be filled by overload rules and
	  their size will grow incrementally, taking up more memory.
	  Sometimes an <acronym>IP</acronym> address that is blocked
	  is a dynamically assigned one, which has since been assigned
	  to a host who has a legitimate reason to communicate with
	  hosts in the local network.</para>

	<para>For situations like these,
	  <application>pfctl</application> provides the ability to
	  expire table entries.  For example, this command will remove
	  <literal>&lt;bruteforce&gt;</literal> table entries which
	  have not been referenced for <literal>86400</literal>
	  seconds:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pfctl -t bruteforce -T expire 86400</userinput></screen>

	<para>Similar functionality is provided by
	  <package>security/expiretable</package>, which removes table
	  entries which have not been accessed for a specified period
	  of time.</para>

	<para>Once installed, <application>expiretable</application>
	  can be run to remove <literal>&lt;bruteforce&gt;</literal>
	  table entries older than a specified age.  This example
	  removes all entries older than 24 hours:</para>

	<programlisting>/usr/local/sbin/expiretable -v -d -t 24h bruteforce</programlisting>

	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The next step is to configure

	      Refer to these for additional configuration options
	      beyond those shown in this example.</para>

	    <para>One of the first lines in the configuration file

	    <programlisting>all:\
    :traplist:whitelist:</programlisting>

	    <para>This entry adds the desired blacklists, separated by

	    <para>where the first line is the name of the blacklist
	      and the second line specifies the list type.  The
	      <literal>msg</literal> field contains the message to
	      display to blacklisted senders during the

	      Finally, the <literal>file</literal> field specifies

	      expects to receive.</para>

	    <para>The definition of the specified whitelist is

	  ruleset behave sanely.</para>

	<para>The <literal>block-policy</literal> is an option which
	  can be set in the <literal>options</literal> part of the
	  ruleset, which precedes the redirection and filtering rules.
	  This option determines which feedback, if any,
	  <application>PF</application> sends to hosts that are
	  blocked by a rule.  The option has two possible values:
	  <literal>drop</literal> drops blocked packets with no
	  feedback, and <literal>return</literal> returns a status
	  code such as
	  <computeroutput>Connection refused</computeroutput>.</para>

	<para>If not set, the default policy is

	<para>In <application>PF</application>,
	  <literal>scrub</literal> is a keyword which enables network

	  measure of protection against certain kinds of attacks
	  based on incorrect handling of packet fragments.  A number
	  of options are available, but the simplest form is suitable
	  for most configurations:</para>

	<programlisting>scrub in all</programlisting>

	<para>Some services, such as <acronym>NFS</acronym>, require

	<para>The <literal>antispoof</literal> mechanism protects

	any of the rules, it gets caught by the mandatory
	<application>IPFW</application> default rule number 65535,
	which denies all packets and silently discards them.  However,
	if the packet matches a rule that contains the
	<literal>count</literal>, <literal>skipto</literal>, or

      <title>Example Ruleset</title>

      <para>This section demonstrates how to create an example
	stateful firewall ruleset script named
	<filename>/etc/ipfw.rules</filename>.  In this example, all
	connection rules use <literal>in</literal> or
	<literal>out</literal> to clarify the direction.  They also
	use <literal>via</literal>
	<replaceable>interface-name</replaceable> to specify
	the interface the packet is traveling over.</para>

      <note>
	<para>When first creating or testing a firewall ruleset,
	  consider temporarily setting this tunable:</para>

	<programlisting>net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept="1"</programlisting>

	<para>This sets the default policy of &man.ipfw.8; to be more
	  permissive than the default <literal>deny ip from any to
	    any</literal>, making it slightly more difficult to get
	  locked out of the system right after a reboot.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The firewall script begins by indicating that it is a
	Bourne shell script and flushes any existing rules.  It then
	creates the <literal>cmd</literal> variable so that
	<literal>ipfw add</literal> does not have to be typed at the
	beginning of every rule.  It also defines the
	<literal>pif</literal> variable which represents the name of
	the interface that is attached to the Internet.</para>

      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
# Flush out the list before we begin.
ipfw -q -f flush

# Set rules command prefix
cmd="ipfw -q add"
pif="dc0"     # interface name of NIC attached to Internet</programlisting>

      <para>The first two rules allow all traffic on the trusted
	internal interface and on the loopback interface:</para>

      <programlisting># Change xl0 to LAN NIC interface name
&dollar;cmd 00005 allow all from any to any via xl0

# No restrictions on Loopback Interface
&dollar;cmd 00010 allow all from any to any via lo0</programlisting>

      <para>The next rule allows the packet through if it matches an
	existing entry in the dynamic rules table:</para>

      <programlisting>&dollar;cmd 00101 check-state</programlisting>

      <para>The next set of rules defines which stateful connections
	internal systems can create to hosts on the Internet:</para>

      <programlisting># Allow access to public DNS
# Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of a public DNS server
# and repeat for each DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf
&dollar;cmd 00110 allow tcp from any to x.x.x.x 53 out via &dollar;pif setup keep-state
&dollar;cmd 00111 allow udp from any to x.x.x.x 53 out via &dollar;pif keep-state

# Allow access to ISP's DHCP server for cable/DSL configurations.
# Use the first rule and check log for IP address.

# deny and log all other outbound connections
&dollar;cmd 00299 deny log all from any to any out via &dollar;pif</programlisting>

      <para>The next set of rules controls connections from Internet
	hosts to the internal network.  It starts by denying packets
	typically associated with attacks and then explicitly allows
	specific types of connections.  All the authorized services
	that originate from the Internet use <literal>limit</literal>

      <para>&os;'s built-in <acronym>NAT</acronym> daemon,
	&man.natd.8;, works in conjunction with
	<application>IPFW</application> to provide network address
	translation.  This can be used to provide an Internet
	Connection Sharing solution so that several internal computers
	can connect to the Internet using a single
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address.</para>

      <para>To do this, the &os; machine connected to the Internet
	must act as a gateway.  This system must have two
	<acronym>NIC</acronym>s, where one is connected to the
	Internet and the other is connected to the internal
	<acronym>LAN</acronym>.  Each machine connected to the
	<acronym>LAN</acronym> should be assigned an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address in the private network space, as
	defined by <link
	  xlink:href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1918.txt">RFC
	  1918</link>, and have the default gateway set to the
	&man.natd.8; system's internal <acronym>IP</acronym>
	address.</para>

      <para>Some additional configuration is needed in order to
	activate the <acronym>NAT</acronym> function of
	<application>IPFW</application>.  If the system has a custom
	kernel, the kernel configuration file needs to include
	<literal>option IPDIVERT</literal> along with the other
	<literal>IPFIREWALL</literal> options described in <xref
	  linkend="firewalls-ipfw-enable"/>.</para>

      <para>To enable <acronym>NAT</acronym> support at boot time, the
	following must be in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"		# enables the gateway
natd_enable="YES"		# enables <acronym>NAT</acronym>
natd_interface="rl0"		# specify interface name of NIC attached to Internet
natd_flags="-dynamic -m"	# -m = preserve port numbers; additional options are listed in &man.natd.8;</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>It is also possible to specify a configuration file
	  which contains the options to pass to &man.natd.8;:</para>

	<programlisting>natd_flags="-f /etc/natd.conf"</programlisting>

	<para>The specified file must contain a list of configuration
	  options, one per line.  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

	<para>For more information about this configuration file,
	  consult &man.natd.8;.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Next, add the <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules to the firewall
	ruleset.  When the rulest contains stateful rules, the
	positioning of the <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules is critical
	and the <literal>skipto</literal> action is used.  The
	<literal>skipto</literal> action requires a rule number so
	that it knows which rule to jump to.</para>

      <para>The following example builds upon the firewall ruleset
	shown in the previous section.  It adds some additional
	entries and modifies some existing rules in order to configure
	the firewall for <acronym>NAT</acronym>.  It starts by adding
	some additional variables which represent the rule number to
	skip to, the <literal>keep-state</literal> option, and a list
	of <acronym>TCP</acronym> ports which will be used to reduce
	the number of rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
ipfw -q -f flush
cmd="ipfw -q add"
skip="skipto 500"
pif=dc0
ks="keep-state"
good_tcpo="22,25,37,53,80,443,110"</programlisting>

      <para>The inbound <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule is inserted
	<emphasis>after</emphasis> the two rules which allow all
	traffic on the trusted internal interface and on the loopback
	interface and <emphasis>before</emphasis> the
	<literal>check-state</literal> rule.  It is important that the
	rule number selected for this <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule, in
	this example <literal>100</literal>, is higher than the first
	two rules and lower than the <literal>check-state</literal>
	rule:</para>

      <programlisting>&dollar;cmd 005 allow all from any to any via xl0  # exclude LAN traffic
&dollar;cmd 010 allow all from any to any via lo0  # exclude loopback traffic
&dollar;cmd 100 divert natd ip from any to any in via &dollar;pif # NAT any inbound packets
# Allow the packet through if it has an existing entry in the dynamic rules table
&dollar;cmd 101 check-state</programlisting>

      <para>The outbound rules are modified to replace the
	<literal>allow</literal> action with the
	<literal>&dollar;skip</literal> variable, indicating that rule
	processing will continue at rule <literal>500</literal>.  The
	seven <literal>tcp</literal> rules have been replaced by rule
	<literal>125</literal> as the
	<literal>&dollar;good_tcpo</literal> variable contains the
	seven allowed outbound ports.</para>

      <programlisting># Authorized outbound packets
&dollar;cmd 120 &dollar;skip udp from any to x.x.x.x 53 out via &dollar;pif &dollar;ks
&dollar;cmd 121 &dollar;skip udp from any to x.x.x.x 67 out via &dollar;pif &dollar;ks
&dollar;cmd 125 &dollar;skip tcp from any to any &dollar;good_tcpo out via &dollar;pif setup &dollar;ks
&dollar;cmd 130 &dollar;skip icmp from any to any out via &dollar;pif &dollar;ks</programlisting>

      <para>The inbound rules remain the same, except for the very
	last rule which removes the <literal> via $pif</literal> in
	order to catch both inbound and outbound rules.  The
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> rule must follow this last outbound
	rule, must have a higher number than that last rule, and the
	rule number must be referenced by the
	<literal>skipto</literal> action.  In this ruleset, rule
	number <literal>500</literal> diverts all packets which match
	the outbound rules to &man.natd.8; for
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> processing.  The next rule allows any
	packet which has undergone <acronym>NAT</acronym> processing
	to pass.</para>

      <programlisting>&dollar;cmd 499 deny log all from any to any
&dollar;cmd 500 divert natd ip from any to any out via &dollar;pif # skipto location for outbound stateful rules
&dollar;cmd 510 allow ip from any to any</programlisting>

      <para>In this example, rules <literal>100</literal>,
	<literal>101</literal>, <literal>125</literal>,
	<literal>500</literal>, and <literal>510</literal> control the
	address translation of the outbound and inbound packets so
	that the entries in the dynamic state table always register
	the private <acronym>LAN</acronym> <acronym>IP</acronym>
	address.</para>

      <para>Consider an internal web browser which initializes a new
	outbound <acronym>HTTP</acronym> session over port 80.  When
	the first outbound packet enters the firewall, it does not
	match rule <literal>100</literal> because it is headed out
	rather than in.  It passes rule <literal>101</literal> because
	this is the first packet and it has not been posted to the
	dynamic state table yet.  The packet finally matches rule
	<literal>125</literal> as it is outbound on an allowed port
	and has a source <acronym>IP</acronym> address from the
	internal <acronym>LAN</acronym>.  On matching this rule, two
	actions take place.  First, the <literal>keep-state</literal>
	action adds an entry to the dynamic state table and the
	specified action, <literal>skipto rule 500</literal>, is
	executed.  Next, the packet undergoes <acronym>NAT</acronym>
	and is sent out to the Internet.  This packet makes its way to
	the destination web server, where a response packet is
	generated and sent back.  This new packet enters the top of
	the ruleset.  It matches rule <literal>100</literal> and has
	its destination <acronym>IP</acronym> address mapped back to
	the original internal address.  It then is processed by the
	<literal>check-state</literal> rule, is found in the table as
	an existing session, and is released to the
	<acronym>LAN</acronym>.</para>

      <para>On the inbound side, the ruleset has to deny bad packets
	and allow only authorized services.  A packet which matches an
	inbound rule is posted to the dynamic state table and the
	packet is released to the <acronym>LAN</acronym>.  The packet
	generated as a response is recognized by the
	<literal>check-state</literal> rule as belonging to an
	existing session.  It is then sent to rule
	<literal>500</literal> to undergo
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> before being released to the outbound
	interface.</para>

	<title>Port Redirection</title>

	<para>The drawback with &man.natd.8; is that the
	  <acronym>LAN</acronym> clients are not accessible from the
	  Internet.  Clients on the <acronym>LAN</acronym> can make
	  outgoing connections to the world but cannot receive
	  incoming ones.  This presents a problem if trying to run
	  Internet services on one of the <acronym>LAN</acronym>
	  client machines.  A simple way around this is to redirect
	  selected Internet ports on the &man.natd.8; machine to a
	  <acronym>LAN</acronym> client.</para>

	<para>For example, an <acronym>IRC</acronym> server runs on
	  client <systemitem>A</systemitem> and a web server runs on
	  client <systemitem>B</systemitem>.  For this to work
	  properly, connections received on ports 6667
	  (<acronym>IRC</acronym>) and 80 (<acronym>HTTP</acronym>)
	  must be redirected to the respective machines.</para>

	<para>The syntax for <option>-redirect_port</option> is as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>     -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                 [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                 [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]</programlisting>

	<para>In the above example, the argument should be:</para>

	<programlisting>    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

	<para>This redirects the proper <acronym>TCP</acronym> ports
	  to the <acronym>LAN</acronym> client machines.</para>

	<para>Port ranges over individual ports can be indicated with
	  <option>-redirect_port</option>.  For example,
	  <replaceable>tcp 192.168.0.2:2000-3000
	    2000-3000</replaceable> would redirect all connections
	  received on ports 2000 to 3000 to ports 2000 to 3000 on
	  client <systemitem>A</systemitem>.</para>

	<para>These options can be used when directly running
	  &man.natd.8;, placed within the
	  <literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, or passed via a
	  configuration file.</para>

	<title>Address Redirection</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>address redirection</primary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>Address redirection is useful if more than one
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address is available.  Each
	  <acronym>LAN</acronym> client can be assigned its own
	  external <acronym>IP</acronym> address by &man.natd.8;,
	  which will then rewrite outgoing packets from the
	  <acronym>LAN</acronym> clients with the proper external
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address and redirects all traffic
	  incoming on that particular <acronym>IP</acronym> address
	  back to the specific <acronym>LAN</acronym> client.  This is
	  also known as static <acronym>NAT</acronym>.  For example,
	  if <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses <systemitem
	    class="ipaddress">128.1.1.1</systemitem>, <systemitem
	    class="ipaddress">128.1.1.2</systemitem>, and <systemitem
	    class="ipaddress">128.1.1.3</systemitem> are available,
	  <systemitem class="ipaddress">128.1.1.1</systemitem> can be
	  used as the &man.natd.8; machine's external
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address, while <systemitem
	    class="ipaddress">128.1.1.2</systemitem> and <systemitem
	    class="ipaddress">128.1.1.3</systemitem> are forwarded
	  back to <acronym>LAN</acronym> clients
	  <systemitem>A</systemitem> and
	  <systemitem>B</systemitem>.</para>

	<para>The <option>-redirect_address</option> syntax is as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>-redirect_address localIP publicIP</programlisting>


	<informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	  <tgroup cols="2">
	    <tbody>
	      <row>
		<entry>localIP</entry>
		<entry>The internal <acronym>IP</acronym> address of
		  the <acronym>LAN</acronym> client.</entry>
	      </row>

	      <row>
		<entry>publicIP</entry>
		<entry>The external <acronym>IP</acronym> address
		  corresponding to the <acronym>LAN</acronym>
		  client.</entry>
	      </row>
	    </tbody>
	  </tgroup>
	</informaltable>

	<para>In the example, this argument would read:</para>

	<programlisting>-redirect_address 192.168.0.2 128.1.1.2
-redirect_address 192.168.0.3 128.1.1.3</programlisting>

	<para>Like <option>-redirect_port</option>, these arguments
	  are placed within the <literal>natd_flags=""</literal>
	  option of <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, or passed via a
	  configuration file.  With address redirection, there is no
	  need for port redirection since all data received on a
	  particular <acronym>IP</acronym> address is
	  redirected.</para>

	<para>The external <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses on the
	  &man.natd.8; machine must be active and aliased to the
	  external interface.  Refer to &man.rc.conf.5; for

      <para><command>ipfw</command> can be used to make manual,
	single rule additions or deletions to the active firewall
	while it is running.  The problem with using this method is
	that all the changes are lost when the system reboots.  It is
	recommended to instead write all the rules in a file and to
	use that file to load the rules at boot time and to replace
	the currently running firewall rules whenever that file
	changes.</para>

      <para><command>ipfw</command> is a useful way to display the
	running firewall rules to the console screen.  The
	<application>IPFW</application> accounting facility
	dynamically creates a counter for each rule that counts each
	packet that matches the rule.  During the process of testing a
	rule, listing the rule with its counter is one way to
	determine if the rule is functioning as expected.</para>

      <para>To list all the running rules in sequence:</para>

	  <secondary>logging</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>Even with the logging facility enabled,
	  <application>IPFW</application> will not generate any rule
	  logging on its own.  The firewall administrator decides
	  which rules in the ruleset will be logged, and adds the
	  <literal>log</literal> keyword to those rules.  Normally
	  only deny rules are logged.  It is customary to duplicate
	  the <quote>ipfw default deny everything</quote> rule with
	  the <literal>log</literal> keyword included as the last rule
	  in the ruleset.  This way, it is possible to see all the
	  packets that did not match any of the rules in the
	  ruleset.</para>

	<para>Logging is a two edged sword.  If one is not careful,
	  an over abundance of log data or a DoS attack can fill the
	  disk with log files.  Log messages are not only written to
	  <application>syslogd</application>, but also are displayed
	  on the root console screen and soon become annoying.</para>

	<para>The <literal>IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=5</literal>
	  kernel option limits the number of consecutive messages
	  sent to &man.syslogd.8;, concerning the packet matching of a
	  given rule.  When this option is enabled in the kernel, the
	  number of consecutive messages concerning a particular rule
	  is capped at the number specified.  There is nothing to be
	  gained from 200 identical log messages.  With this option
	  set to five,
	  five consecutive messages concerning a particular rule
	  would be logged to <application>syslogd</application> and
	  the remainder identical consecutive messages would be
	  counted and posted to <application>syslogd</application>
	  with a phrase like the following:</para>

	<programlisting>last message repeated 45 times</programlisting>

	<title>Building a Rule Script</title>

	<para>Most experienced <application>IPFW</application> users
	  create a file containing the rules and code them in a manner
	  compatible with running them as a script.  The major benefit
	  of doing this is the firewall rules can be refreshed in mass
	  without the need of rebooting the system to activate them.
	  This method is convenient in testing new rules as the
	  procedure can be executed as many times as needed.  Being a
	  script, symbolic substitution can be used for frequently

	<para>This example script is compatible with the syntax used
	  by the &man.sh.1;,  &man.csh.1;, and &man.tcsh.1; shells.
	  Symbolic substitution fields are prefixed with a dollar sign

	<secondary>rule syntax</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>This section describes the <application>IPF</application>
	rule syntax used to create stateful rules.  When creating
	rules, keep in mind that unless the <literal>quick</literal>
	keyword appears in a rule, every rule is read in order, with
	the <emphasis>last  matching rule</emphasis> being the one
	that is applied.  This means that even if the first rule to
	match a packet is a <literal>pass</literal>, if there is a
	later matching rule that is a <literal>block</literal>, the
	packet will be dropped.  Sample rulesets can be found in
	<filename
	  >/usr/share/examples/ipfilter</filename>.</para>

      <para>When creating rules, a <literal>#</literal> character is
	used to mark the start of a comment and may appear at the end
	of a rule, to explain that rule's function, or on its own
	line.  Any blank lines are ignored.</para>

      <para>The keywords which are used in rules must be written in a
	specific order, from left to right.  Some keywords are
	mandatory while others are optional.  Some keywords have
	sub-options which may be keywords themselves and also include
	more sub-options.  The keyword order is as follows, where the
	words shown in uppercase represent a variable and the words
	shown in lowercase must precede the variable that follows
	it:</para>

      <para><replaceable>ACTION DIRECTION OPTIONS proto PROTO_TYPE
	  from SRC_ADDR SRC_PORT to DST_ADDR DST_PORT
	  TCP_FLAG|ICMP_TYPE keep state STATE</replaceable></para>

      <para>This section describes each of these keywords and their
	options.  It is not an exhaustive list of every possible
	option.  Refer to &man.ipf.5; for a complete description of
	the rule syntax that can be used when creating
	<application>IPF</application> rules and examples for using
	each keyword.</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>ACTION</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The action keyword indicates what to do with the
	      packet if it matches that rule.  Every rule
	      <emphasis>must</emphasis> have an action.  The
	      following actions are recognized:</para>

	    <para><literal>block</literal>: drops the packet.</para>

	    <para><literal>pass</literal>: allows the packet.</para>

	    <para><literal>log</literal>: generates a log
	      record.</para>

	    <para><literal>count</literal>: counts the number of
	      packets and bytes which can provide an indication of
	      how often a rule is used.</para>

	    <para><literal>auth</literal>: queues the packet for
	      further processing by another program.</para>

	    <para><literal>call</literal>: provides access to
	      functions built into <application>IPF</application> that
	      allow more complex actions.</para>

	    <para><literal>decapsulate</literal>: removes any headers
	      in order to process the contents of the packet.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>DIRECTION</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Next, each rule must explicitly state the direction
	      of traffic using one of these keywords:</para>

	    <para><literal>in</literal>: the rule is applied against

      <title>Example Ruleset</title>

      <para>This section demonstrates how to create an example ruleset
	which only allows services matching
	<literal>pass</literal> rules and blocks all others.</para>

      <para>&os; uses the loopback interface
	(<filename>lo0</filename>) and the <acronym>IP</acronym>
	address <systemitem class="ipaddress">127.0.0.1</systemitem>
	for internal communication.  The firewall ruleset must contain
	rules to allow free movement of these internally used
	packets:</para>

      <programlisting># no restrictions on loopback interface
pass in quick on lo0 all
pass out quick on lo0 all</programlisting>

      <para>The public interface connected to the Internet is used to
	authorize and control access of all outbound and inbound
	connections.  If one or more interfaces are cabled to private
	networks, those internal interfaces may require rules to allow
	packets originating from the <acronym>LAN</acronym> to flow
	between the internal networks or to the interface attached to
	the Internet.  The ruleset should be organized into three
	major sections: any trusted internal interfaces, outbound
	connections through the public interface, and inbound
	connections through the public interface.</para>

      <para>These two rules allow all traffic to pass through a
	trusted <acronym>LAN</acronym> interface named
	<filename>xl0</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting># no restrictions on inside LAN interface for private network
pass out quick on xl0 all
pass in quick on xl0 all</programlisting>

      <para>The rules for the public interface's outbound and inbound
	sections should have the most frequently matched rules placed
	before less commonly matched rules, with the last rule in the
	section blocking and logging all packets for that interface
	and direction.</para>

      <para>This set of rules defines the outbound section of the
	public interface named <filename>dc0</filename>.  These rules
	keep state and identify the specific services that internal
	systems are authorized for public Internet access.  All the
	rules use <literal>quick</literal> and specify the
	appropriate port numbers and, where applicable, destination
	addresses.</para>

      <programlisting># interface facing Internet (outbound)

      <para>This example of the rules in the inbound section of the
	public interface blocks all undesirable packets first.  This
	reduces the number of packets that are logged by the last
	rule.</para>

      <para>To enable <acronym>NAT</acronym>, add these statements
	to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and specify the name of
	the file containing the <acronym>NAT</acronym> rules:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"
ipnat_enable="YES"
ipnat_rules="/etc/ipnat.rules"</programlisting>

      <para><acronym>NAT</acronym> rules are flexible and can
	accomplish many different things to fit the needs of both
	commercial and home users.  The rule syntax presented here has
	been simplified to demonstrate common usage.  For a complete
	rule syntax description, refer to &man.ipnat.5;.</para>

      <para>The basic syntax for a <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule is as
	follows, where <literal>map</literal> starts the rule and
	<replaceable>IF</replaceable> should be replaced with the
	name of the external interface:</para>

      <programlisting>map <replaceable>IF</replaceable> <replaceable>LAN_IP_RANGE</replaceable> -&gt; <replaceable>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</replaceable></programlisting>

      <para>The <replaceable>LAN_IP_RANGE</replaceable> is the range
	of <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses used by internal clients.
	Usually, it is a private address range such as <systemitem
	  class="ipaddress">192.168.1.0/24</systemitem>.  The
	<replaceable>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</replaceable> can either be the
	static external <acronym>IP</acronym> address or the keyword
	<literal>0/32</literal> which represents the
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address assigned to
	<replaceable>IF</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>In <application>IPF</application>, when a packet arrives
	at the firewall from the <acronym>LAN</acronym> with a public
	destination, it first passes through the outbound rules of the
	firewall ruleset.  Then, the packet is passed to the
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> ruleset which is read from the top
	down, where the first matching rule wins.
	<application>IPF</application> tests each
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> rule against the packet's interface
	name and source <acronym>IP</acronym> address.  When a
	packet's interface name matches a <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule,
	the packet's source <acronym>IP</acronym> address in the
	private <acronym>LAN</acronym> is checked to see if it falls
	within the <acronym>IP</acronym> address range specified in
	<replaceable>LAN_IP_RANGE</replaceable>.  On a match, the
	packet has its source <acronym>IP</acronym> address rewritten
	with the public <acronym>IP</acronym> address specified by
	<replaceable>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</replaceable>.
	<application>IPF</application> posts an entry in its internal
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> table so that when the packet returns
	from the Internet, it can be mapped back to its original
	private <acronym>IP</acronym> address before being passed to
	the firewall rules for further processing.</para>

      <para>For networks that have large numbers of internal systems
	or multiple subnets, the process of funneling every private
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address into a single public
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address becomes a resource problem.
	Two methods are available to relieve this issue.</para>

      <para>The first method is to assign a range of ports to use as
	source ports.  By adding the <literal>portmap</literal>
	keyword, <acronym>NAT</acronym> can be directed to only use
	source ports in the specified range:</para>

      <programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp 20000:60000</programlisting>

      <para>Alternately, use the <literal>auto</literal> keyword
	which tells <acronym>NAT</acronym> to determine the ports
	that are available for use:</para>

      <programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 0/32 portmap tcp/udp auto</programlisting>

      <para>The second method is to use a pool of public addresses.
	This is useful when there are too many
	<acronym>LAN</acronym> addresses to fit into a single public
	address and a block of public <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses
	is available.  These public addresses can be used as a pool
	from which <acronym>NAT</acronym> selects an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address as a packet's address is
	mapped on its way out.</para>

      <para>The range of public <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses can
	be specified using a netmask or <acronym>CIDR</acronym>
	notation.  These two rules are equivalent:</para>

      <programlisting>map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 204.134.75.0/255.255.255.0
map dc0 192.168.1.0/24 -&gt; 204.134.75.0/24</programlisting>

      <para>A common practice is to have a publically accessible web
	server or mail server segregated to an internal network
	segment.  The traffic from these servers still has to undergo
	<acronym>NAT</acronym>, but port redirection is needed to
	direct inbound traffic to the correct server.  For example, to
	map a web server using the internal address <systemitem
	  class="ipaddress">10.0.10.25</systemitem> to its public
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address of <systemitem
	  class="ipaddress">20.20.20.5</systemitem>, use this
	rule:</para>

      <programlisting>rdr dc0 20.20.20.5/32 port 80 -&gt; 10.0.10.25 port 80</programlisting>

      <para>If it is the only web server, this rule would also work as
	it redirects all external <acronym>HTTP</acronym> requests to
	<literal>10.0.10.25</literal>:</para>

      <programlisting>rdr dc0 0.0.0.0/0 port 80 -&gt; 10.0.10.25 port 80</programlisting>

      <para><application>IPF</application> has a built in
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> proxy which can be used with
	<acronym>NAT</acronym>.  It monitors all outbound traffic for
	active or passive <acronym>FTP</acronym> connection requests
	and dynamically creates temporary filter rules containing the
	port number used by the <acronym>FTP</acronym> data channel.
	This eliminates the need to open large ranges of high order
	ports for <acronym>FTP</acronym> connections.</para>

      <para>In this example, the first rule calls the proxy for
	outbound <acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic from the internal
	<acronym>LAN</acronym>.  The second rule passes the
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic from the firewall to the
	Internet, and the third rule handles all
	non-<acronym>FTP</acronym> traffic from the internal
	<acronym>LAN</acronym>:</para>

      <programlisting>map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp
map dc0 0.0.0.0/0 -&gt; 0/32 proxy port 21 ftp/tcp
map dc0 10.0.10.0/29 -&gt; 0/32</programlisting>

      <para>The <acronym>FTP</acronym> <literal>map</literal> rules go
	before the <acronym>NAT</acronym> rule so that when a packet
	matches an <acronym>FTP</acronym> rule, the
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> proxy creates temporary filter rules to
	let the <acronym>FTP</acronym> session packets pass and
	undergo <acronym>NAT</acronym>.  All LAN packets that are not
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> will not match the
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> rules but will undergo
	<acronym>NAT</acronym> if they match the third rule.</para>

      <para>Without the <acronym>FTP</acronym> proxy, the following
	firewall rules would instead be needed.  Note that without the
	proxy, all ports above <literal>1024</literal> need to be
	allowed:</para>

      <programlisting># Allow out LAN PC client FTP to public Internet
# Active and passive modes

      <title>Building the Rule Script with Symbolic
	Substitution</title>

      <para>Some experienced IPF users create a file containing the
	rules and code them in a manner compatible with running them
	as a script with symbolic substitution.  The major benefit
	of doing this is that only the value associated with the
	symbolic name needs to be changed, and when the script is
	run all the rules containing the symbolic name will have the
	value substituted in the rules.  Being a script, symbolic
	substitution can be used to code frequently used values and
	substitute them in multiple rules.  This can be seen in the
	following example.</para>

      <para>The script syntax used here is compatible with the
	&man.sh.1;, &man.csh.1;, and &man.tcsh.1; shells.</para>

      <para>Symbolic substitution fields are prefixed with a
	<literal>&dollar;</literal>.</para>

      <para>Symbolic fields do not have the &dollar; prefix.</para>

      <para>The value to populate the symbolic field must be enclosed
	between double quotes (<literal>"</literal>).</para>

      <para>Start the rule file with something like this:</para>

################## End of IPF rules script ########################</programlisting>

      <para>The rules are not important in this example as it instead
	focuses on how the symbolic substitution fields are populated.
	If this example was in a file named
	<filename>/etc/ipf.rules.script</filename>, these rules could
	be reloaded by running:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh /etc/ipf.rules.script</userinput></screen>

      <para>There is one problem with using a rules file with embedded
	symbolics: IPF does not understand symbolic substitution, and
	cannot read such scripts directly.</para>

      <para>This script can be used in one of two ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Uncomment the line that begins with
	    <literal>cat</literal>, and comment out the line that
	    begins with <literal>/sbin/ipf</literal>.  Place
	    <literal>ipfilter_enable="YES"</literal> into
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, and run the script
	    once after each modification to create or update
	    <filename>/etc/ipf.rules</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Disable <application>IPFILTER</application> in the
	    system startup scripts by adding
	    <literal>ipfilter_enable="NO"</literal>to
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Then, add a script like the following to
	    <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/</filename>.  The script
	    should have an obvious name like
	    <filename>ipf.loadrules.sh</filename>, where the
	    <filename>.sh</filename> extension is mandatory.</para>

	  <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
sh /etc/ipf.rules.script</programlisting>

	  <para>The permissions on this script file must be read,
	    write, execute for owner
	    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 700 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ipf.loadrules.sh</userinput></screen>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Now, when the system boots, the IPF rules will be
	loaded.</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para><application>IPF</application> includes &man.ipfstat.8;
	which can be used to retrieve
	and display statistics which are gathered
	as packets match rules as they go through the
	firewall.  Statistics are accumulated since the firewall was
	last started or since the last time they
	were reset to zero using <command>ipf
	  -Z</command>.</para>

      <para>The default <command>ipfstat</command> output looks
	like this:</para>

      <screen>input packets: blocked 99286 passed 1255609 nomatch 14686 counted 0
 output packets: blocked 4200 passed 1284345 nomatch 14687 counted 0

 OUT Pullups succeeded: 0 failed: 0
 Fastroute successes: 0 failures: 0
 TCP cksum fails(in): 0 (out): 0
 Packet log flags set: (0)</screen>

      <para>Several options are available.  When supplied with either
	<option>-i</option> for inbound or <option>-o</option> for
	outbound, the command will retrieve and display the
	appropriate list of filter rules currently installed and in
	use by the kernel.  To also see the rule numbers, include
	<option>-n</option>.  For example, <command>ipfstat
	  -on</command> displays the outbound rules table with rule
	numbers:</para>

      <screen>@1 pass out on xl0 from any to any
@2 block out on dc0 from any to any
@3 pass out quick on dc0 proto tcp/udp from any to any keep state</screen>

      <para>Include <option>-h</option> to prefix each rule with a
	count of how many times the rule was matched.  For example,
	<command>ipfstat -oh</command> displays the outbound internal
	rules table, prefixing each rule with its usage count:</para>

      <screen>2451423 pass out on xl0 from any to any
354727 block out on dc0 from any to any
430918 pass out quick on dc0 proto tcp/udp from any to any keep state</screen>

      <para>To display the state table in a format similar to
	&man.top.1;, use <command>ipfstat -t</command>.  When the
	firewall is under attack, this option provides the ability to
	identify and see the attacking packets.  The optional
	sub-flags give the ability to select the destination or source
	<acronym>IP</acronym>, port, or protocol to be monitored in
	real time.  Refer to &man.ipfstat.8; for details.</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para><application>IPF</application> provides
	<command>ipmon</command>, which can be used to write the
	firewall's logging information in a human readable format.  It
	requires that <literal>options IPFILTER_LOG</literal> be first
	added to a custom kernel using the instructions in <xref
	  linkend="kernelconfig"/>.</para>

      <para>This command is typically run in daemon mode in order to
	provide a continuous system log file so that logging of past
	events may be reviewed.  Since &os; has a built in
	&man.syslogd.8; facility to automatically rotate system logs,
	the default <filename>rc.conf</filename>
	<literal>ipmon_flags</literal> statement uses
	<option>-Ds</option>:</para>

      <programlisting>ipmon_flags="-Ds" # D = start as daemon
                  # s = log to syslog
                  # v = log tcp window, ack, seq
                  # n = map IP &amp; port to names</programlisting>

      <para>Logging provides the ability to review, after the fact,
	information such as which packets were dropped, what addresses
	they came from, and where they were going.  This information
	is useful in tracking down attackers.</para>

      <para>Once the logging facility is enabled in
	<filename>rc.conf</filename> and started with <command>service
	  ipmon start</command>, <application>IPF</application> will
	only log the rules which contain the <literal>log</literal>
	keyword.  The firewall administrator decides which rules in
	the ruleset should be logged and normally only deny rules are
	logged.  It is customary to include the
	<literal>log</literal> keyword in the last rule in the
	ruleset.  This makes it possible to see all the packets that
	did not match any of the rules in the ruleset.</para>

      <para>By default, <command>ipmon -Ds</command> mode uses
	<literal>local0</literal> as the logging facility.  The
	following logging levels can be used to further segregate the
	logged data:</para>

      <screen>LOG_INFO - packets logged using the "log" keyword as the action rather than pass or block.
LOG_NOTICE - packets logged which are also passed
LOG_WARNING - packets logged which are also blocked
LOG_ERR - packets which have been logged and which can be considered short due to an incomplete header</screen>

      <para>In order to setup <application>IPF</application> to
	log all data to <filename>/var/log/ipfilter.log</filename>,
	first create the empty file:</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch /var/log/ipfilter.log</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then, to write all logged messages to the specified file,
	add the following statement to
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>local0.* /var/log/ipfilter.log</programlisting>

      <para>To activate the changes and instruct &man.syslogd.8;
	to read the modified <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>,
	run <command>service syslogd reload</command>.</para>

      <para>Do not forget to edit
	<filename>/etc/newsyslog.conf</filename> to rotate the new
	log file.</para>

      <para>Messages generated by <command>ipmon</command> consist
	of data fields separated by white space.  Fields common to
	all messages are:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The date of packet receipt.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The time of packet receipt.  This is in the form
	    HH:MM:SS.F, for hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions
	    of a second.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The name of the interface that processed the
	    packet.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The group and rule number of the rule in the format
	    <literal>@0:17</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The action: <literal>p</literal> for passed,
	    <literal>b</literal> for blocked, <literal>S</literal> for
	    a short packet, <literal>n</literal> did not match any
	    rules, and <literal>L</literal> for a log rule.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The addresses written as three fields: the source
	    address and port separated by a comma, the -&gt; symbol,
	    and the destination address and port.  For example:
	    <literal>209.53.17.22,80 -&gt;
	      198.73.220.17,1722</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><literal>PR</literal> followed by the protocol name
	    or number: for example, <literal>PR tcp</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><literal>len</literal> followed by the header length
	    and total length of the packet: for example,
	    <literal>len 20 40</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the packet is a <acronym>TCP</acronym> packet, there
	will be an additional field starting with a hyphen followed by
	letters corresponding to any flags that were set.  Refer to
	&man.ipf.5; for a list of letters and their flags.</para>

      <para>If the packet is an <acronym>ICMP</acronym> packet, there
	will be two fields at the end:  the first always being
	<quote>icmp</quote> and the next being the
	<acronym>ICMP</acronym> message and sub-message type,
	separated by a slash.  For example:
	<literal>icmp 3/3</literal> for a port unreachable
	message.</para>

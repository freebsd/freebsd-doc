  Audience</bridgehead>

  <para>The &os; newcomer will find that the first section of this
    book guides the user through the &os; installation process and
    gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin &unix;.
    Working through this section requires little more than the desire
    to explore, and the ability to take on board new concepts as they
    are introduced.</para>

  <para>Once you have traveled this far, the second, far larger,
    section of the Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner
    of topics of interest to &os; system administrators.  Some of
    these chapters may recommend that you do some prior reading, and
    this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each
    chapter.</para>

  <bridgehead id="preface-overview" renderas=sect1>Organization of This
  Book</bridgehead>

  <para>This book is split into five logically distinct sections.
    The first section, <emphasis>Getting Started</emphasis>, covers
    the installation and basic usage of &os;.  It is expected that
    the reader will follow these chapters in sequence, possibly
    skipping chapters covering familiar topics.  The second section,
    <emphasis>Common Tasks</emphasis>, covers some frequently used
    features of &os;.  This section, and all subsequent sections,
    can be read out of order.  Each chapter begins with a succinct
    synopsis that
    describes what the chapter covers and what the reader is expected
    to already know.  This is meant to allow the casual reader to skip
    around to find chapters of interest.  The third section,
    <emphasis>System Administration</emphasis>, covers administration
    topics.  The fourth section, <emphasis>Network
    Communication</emphasis>, covers networking and server topics.
    The fifth section contains
    appendices of reference information.</para>

  renderas=sect2>User Input</bridgehead>

  <para>Keys are shown in <keycap>bold</keycap> to stand out from
    other text.  Key combinations that are meant to be typed
    simultaneously are shown with `<literal>+</literal>' between
    the keys, such as:</para>

  <para>
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>Alt</keycap>
      <keycap>Del</keycap>
    </keycombo>
  </para>

  <para>Meaning the user should type the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>,
    <keycap>Alt</keycap>, and <keycap>Del</keycap> keys at the same
    time.</para>

  <para>Keys that are meant to be typed in sequence will be separated with
    commas, for example:</para>

  <para>
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>X</keycap>
    </keycombo>,
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>S</keycap>
    </keycombo>
  </para>

  <para>Would mean that the user is expected to type the
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and <keycap>X</keycap> keys simultaneously
    and then to type the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and <keycap>S</keycap>
    keys simultaneously.</para>

  renderas=sect2>Examples</bridgehead>

  <para>Examples starting with <devicename>E:\&gt;</devicename>
  indicate a &ms-dos; command.  Unless otherwise noted, these commands
  may be executed from a <quote>Command Prompt</quote> window in a modern &microsoft.windows;
  environment.</para>

  <screen><prompt>E:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tools\fdimage floppies\kern.flp A:</userinput></screen>

  <para>Examples starting with &prompt.root; indicate a command that
    must be invoked as the superuser in &os;.  You can login as
    <username>root</username> to type the command, or login as your
    normal account and use &man.su.1; to gain
    superuser privileges.</para>

  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

  <para>Examples starting with &prompt.user; indicate a command that
    should be invoked from a normal user account.  Unless otherwise
    noted, C-shell syntax is used for setting environment variables
    and other shell commands.</para>

  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>top</userinput></screen>

  <para>The book you are holding represents the efforts of many hundreds of
    people around the world.  Whether they sent in fixes for typos, or
    submitted complete chapters, all the contributions have been
    useful.</para>

  <para>Several companies have supported the development of this
    document by paying authors to work on it full-time, paying for
    publication, etc.  In particular, BSDi (subsequently acquired by
    <ulink url="http://www.windriver.com">Wind River Systems</ulink>)
    paid members of the &os; Documentation Project to work on
    improving this book full time leading up to the publication of the
    first printed edition in March 2000 (ISBN 1-57176-241-8).  Wind
    River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a
    number of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add
    additional chapters to the text.  This work culminated in the
    publication of the second printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN
    1-57176-303-1).  In 2003-2004, <ulink
    url="http://www.freebsdmall.com">&os; Mall, Inc</ulink>, paid
    several contributors to improve the Handbook in preparation for
    the third printed edition.</para>

    </indexterm>

    <para>Many users install third party software on &os; from the
      Ports Collection and require the installed services to be
      started upon system initialization.  Services, such as
      <package>mail/postfix</package> or
      <package>www/apache22</package> are just two of the many
      software packages which may be started during system
      initialization.  This section explains the procedures available
      for starting third party software.</para>

    <para>In &os;, most included services, such as &man.cron.8;, are
      started through the system start up scripts.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Extended Application Configuration</title>

      <para>Now that &os; includes <filename>rc.d</filename>,
	configuration of application startup is easier and provides
	more features.  Using the key words discussed in
	<xref linkend="configtuning-rcd"/>, applications can be set to
	start after certain other services and extra flags can be
	passed through <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> in place of
	hard coded flags in the start up script.  A basic script may
	look similar to the following:</para>

      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: utility
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name=utility
rcvar=utility_enable

command="/usr/local/sbin/utility"

load_rc_config $name

#
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE DEFAULT VALUES HERE
# SET THEM IN THE /etc/rc.conf FILE
#
utility_enable=${utility_enable-"NO"}
pidfile=${utility_pidfile-"/var/run/utility.pid"}

run_rc_command "$1"</programlisting>

      <para>This script will ensure that the provided
	<literal>utility</literal> will be started after the
	<literal>DAEMON</literal> pseudo-service.  It also provides a
	method for setting and tracking the process ID
	(<acronym>PID</acronym>).</para>

      <para>This application could then have the following line placed
	in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>utility_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>This method allows for easier manipulation of command
	line arguments, inclusion of the default functions provided
	in <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename>, compatibility with
	&man.rcorder.8;, and provides for easier configuration via
	<filename>rc.conf</filename>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using Services to Start Services</title>

      <para>Other services can be started using &man.inetd.8;.
	Working with &man.inetd.8; and its configuration is
	described in depth in
	<xref linkend="network-inetd"/>.</para>

      <para>In some cases, it may make more sense to use
	&man.cron.8; to start system services.  This approach
	has a number of advantages as &man.cron.8; runs these
	processes as the owner of the &man.crontab.5;.  This allows
	regular users to start and maintain their own
	applications.</para>

      <para>The <literal>@reboot</literal> feature of &man.cron.8;,
	may be used in place of the time specification.  This causes
	the job to run when &man.cron.8; is started, normally during
	system initialization.</para>

    </indexterm>

    <para>One of the most useful utilities in &os; is
      <application>cron</application>.  This utility runs in the
      background and regularly checks
      <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> for tasks to execute and
      searches <filename>/var/cron/tabs</filename> for custom crontab
      files.  These files are used to schedule tasks which
      <application>cron</application> runs at the specified times.
      Each entry in a crontab defines a task to run and is known as a
      <firstterm>cron job</firstterm>.</para>

    <para>Two different types of configuration files are used: the
      system crontab, which should not be modified, and user crontabs,
      which can be created and edited as needed.  The format used by
      these files is documented in &man.crontab.5;.  The format of the
      system crontab, <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> includes a
      <literal>who</literal> column which does not exist in user
      crontabs.  In the system crontab,
      <application>cron</application> runs the command as the user
      specified in this column.  In a user crontab, all commands run
      as the user who created the crontab.</para>

    <para>User crontabs allow individual users to schedule their own
      tasks.  The <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user
      can also have a user <filename>crontab</filename> which can be
      used to schedule tasks that do not exist in the system
      <filename>crontab</filename>.</para>

    <para>Here is a sample entry from the system crontab,
      <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>:</para>

	  Comments cannot be on the same line as a command or else
	  they will be interpreted as part of the command; they must
	  be on a new line.  Blank lines are ignored.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="co-env">
	<para>The equals (<literal>=</literal>) character is used to

	  omitted, <application>cron</application> will use the
	  default Bourne shell.  If the <envar>PATH</envar> is
	  omitted, the full path must be given to the command or
	  script to run.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="co-field-descr">

    </info>

    <para>&os; uses the &man.rc.8; system of startup scripts during
      system initialization and for managing services.  The scripts
      listed in <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> provide basic services
      which can be controlled with the <option>start</option>,
      <option>stop</option>, and <option>restart</option> options to
      &man.service.8;.  For instance, &man.sshd.8; can be restarted
      with the following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sshd restart</userinput></screen>

    <para>This procedure can be used to start services on a running
      system.  Services will be started automatically at boot time
      as specified in &man.rc.conf.5;.  For example, to enable
      &man.natd.8; at system startup, add the following line to
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>natd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>If a <option>natd_enable="NO"</option> line is already
      present, change the <literal>NO</literal> to
      <literal>YES</literal>.  The &man.rc.8; scripts will
      automatically load any dependent services during the next boot,
      as described below.</para>

    <para>Since the &man.rc.8; system is primarily intended to start
      and stop services at system startup and shutdown time, the
      <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option> and
      <option>restart</option> options will only perform their action
      if the appropriate <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> variable
      is set.  For instance, <command>sshd restart</command> will
      only work if <varname>sshd_enable</varname> is set to
      <option>YES</option> in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.
      To <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option> or
      <option>restart</option> a service regardless of the settings
      in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, these commands should be
      prefixed with <quote>one</quote>.  For instance, to restart
      &man.sshd.8; regardless of the current
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> setting, execute the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sshd onerestart</userinput></screen>

    <para>To check if a service is enabled in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, run the appropriate
      &man.rc.8; script with <option>rcvar</option>.  This example
      checks to see if &man.sshd.8; is enabled in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sshd rcvar</userinput>
# sshd
#
sshd_enable="YES"
#   (default: "")</screen>

    <note>
      <para>The <literal># sshd</literal> line is output from the
	above command, not a
	<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> console.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To determine whether or not a service is running, use
      <option>status</option>.  For instance, to verify that
      &man.sshd.8; is running:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sshd status</userinput>
sshd is running as pid 433.</screen>

    <para>In some cases, it is also possible to
      <option>reload</option> a service.  This attempts to send a
      signal to an individual service, forcing the service to reload
      its configuration files.  In most cases, this means sending
      the service a <literal>SIGHUP</literal> signal.  Support for
      this feature is not included for every service.</para>

    <para>The &man.rc.8; system is used for network services and it
      also contributes to most of the system initialization.  For
      instance, when the
      <filename>/etc/rc.d/bgfsck</filename> script is executed, it
      prints out the following message:</para>

    <screen>Starting background file system checks in 60 seconds.</screen>

    <para>This script is used for background file system checks,
      which occur only during system initialization.</para>

    <para>Many system services depend on other services to function
      properly.  For example, &man.yp.8; and other
      <acronym>RPC</acronym>-based services may fail to start until
      after the &man.rpcbind.8; service has started.  To resolve this
      issue, information about dependencies and other meta-data is
      included in the comments at the top of each startup script.
      The &man.rcorder.8; program is used to parse these comments
      during system initialization to determine the order in which
      system services should be invoked to satisfy the
      dependencies.</para>

    <para>The following key word must be included in all startup
      scripts as it is required by &man.rc.subr.8; to
      <quote>enable</quote> the startup script:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>PROVIDE</literal>: Specifies the services this
	  file provides.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following key words may be included at the top of each
      startup script.  They are not strictly necessary, but are
      useful as hints to &man.rcorder.8;:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>REQUIRE</literal>: Lists services which are
	  required for this service.  The script containing this key
	  word will run <emphasis>after</emphasis> the specified
	  services.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>BEFORE</literal>: Lists services which depend
	  on this service.  The script containing this key word will
	  run <emphasis>before</emphasis> the specified
	  services.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By carefully setting these keywords for each startup script,
      an administrator has a fine-grained level of control of the
      startup order of the scripts, without the need for
      <quote>runlevels</quote> used by some &unix; operating
      systems.</para>

    <para>Additional information can be found in &man.rc.8; and
      &man.rc.subr.8;.  Refer to <link
	xlink:href="&url.articles.rc-scripting;">this article</link>
      for instructions on how to create custom &man.rc.8;

      <para>The principal location for system configuration
	information is <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This file
	contains a wide range of configuration information and it is
	read at system startup to configure the system.  It provides
	the configuration information for the
	<filename>rc*</filename> files.</para>

      <para>The entries in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> override
	the default settings in
	<filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename>.  The file
	containing the default settings should not be edited.
	Instead, all system-specific changes should be made to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>A number of strategies may be applied in clustered
	applications to separate site-wide configuration from
	system-specific configuration in order to reduce
	administration overhead.  The recommended approach is to place
	system-specific configuration into
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf.local</filename>.  For example, these
	entries in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> apply to all
	systems:</para>

      <programlisting>sshd_enable="YES"
keyrate="fast"
defaultrouter="10.1.1.254"</programlisting>

      <para>Whereas these entries in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf.local</filename> apply to this system
	only:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="node1.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1/8"</programlisting>

      <para>Distribute <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to every
	system using an application such as
	<application>rsync</application> or
	<application>puppet</application>, while
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf.local</filename> remains
	unique.</para>

      <para>Upgrading the system will not overwrite
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, so system configuration
	information will not be lost.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Both <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf.local</filename>
	  are parsed by &man.sh.1;.  This allows system operators to

      <title>Locating the Correct Driver</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>network cards</primary>
	<secondary>driver</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>First, determine the model of the <acronym>NIC</acronym>
	and the chip it uses.  &os; supports a wide variety of
	<acronym>NIC</acronym>s.  Check the Hardware Compatibility
	List for the &os; release to see if the <acronym>NIC</acronym>
	is supported.</para>

      <para>If the <acronym>NIC</acronym> is supported, determine
	the name of the &os; driver for the <acronym>NIC</acronym>.
	Refer to <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> and
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/NOTES</filename>
	for the list of <acronym>NIC</acronym> drivers with some
	information about the supported chipsets.  When in doubt, read
	the manual page of the driver as it will provide more
	information about the supported hardware and any known
	limitations of the driver.</para>

      <para>The drivers for common <acronym>NIC</acronym>s are already
	present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, meaning
	the <acronym>NIC</acronym> should be probed during boot.  The
	system's boot messages can be viewed by typing
	<command>more /var/run/dmesg.boot</command> and using the
	spacebar to scroll through the text.  In this example, two
	Ethernet <acronym>NIC</acronym>s using the &man.dc.4; driver
	are present on the system:</para>

      <screen>dc0: &lt;82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX&gt; port 0xa000-0xa0ff mem 0xd3800000-0xd38
000ff irq 15 at device 11.0 on pci0
miibus0: &lt;MII bus&gt; on dc0
bmtphy0: &lt;BCM5201 10/100baseTX PHY&gt; PHY 1 on miibus0
bmtphy0:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto
dc0: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:da
dc0: [ITHREAD]
dc1: &lt;82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX&gt; port 0x9800-0x98ff mem 0xd3000000-0xd30
000ff irq 11 at device 12.0 on pci0
miibus1: &lt;MII bus&gt; on dc1
bmtphy1: &lt;BCM5201 10/100baseTX PHY&gt; PHY 1 on miibus1
bmtphy1:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto
dc1: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:db
dc1: [ITHREAD]</screen>

      <para>If the driver for the <acronym>NIC</acronym> is not
	present in <filename>GENERIC</filename>, but a driver is
	available, the driver will need to be loaded before the
	<acronym>NIC</acronym> can be configured and used.  This may
	be accomplished in one of two ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The easiest way is to load a kernel module for the
	    <acronym>NIC</acronym> using &man.kldload.8;.  To also
	    automatically load the driver at boot time, add the
	    appropriate line to
	    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  Not all
	    <acronym>NIC</acronym> drivers are available as
	    modules.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Alternatively, statically compile support for the
	    <acronym>NIC</acronym> into a custom kernel.  Refer to
	    <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename>,
	    <filename>/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/NOTES</filename>
	    and the manual page of the driver to determine which line
	    to add to the custom kernel configuration file.  For more
	    information about recompiling the kernel, refer to <xref
	      linkend="kernelconfig"/>.  If the <acronym>NIC</acronym>
	    was detected at boot, the kernel does not need to be
	    recompiled.</para>
	</listitem>

	<para>Unfortunately, there are still many vendors that do not
	  provide schematics for their drivers to the open source
	  community because they regard such information as trade
	  secrets.  Consequently, the developers of &os; and other
	  operating systems are left with two choices: develop the
	  drivers by a long and pain-staking process of reverse
	  engineering or using the existing driver binaries available
	  for &microsoft.windows; platforms.</para>

	<para>&os; provides <quote>native</quote> support for the
	  Network Driver Interface Specification
	  (<acronym>NDIS</acronym>).  It includes &man.ndisgen.8;
	  which can be used to convert a &windowsxp; driver into a
	  format that can be used on &os;.  Because the &man.ndis.4;
	  driver uses a &windowsxp; binary, it only runs on &i386;
	  and amd64 systems.  <acronym>PCI</acronym>, CardBus,
	  <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>, and <acronym>USB</acronym>
	  devices are supported.</para>

	<para>To use &man.ndisgen.8;, three things are needed:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>&os; kernel sources.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>A &windowsxp; driver binary with a
	      <filename>.SYS</filename> extension.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>A &windowsxp; driver configuration file with a
	      <filename>.INF</filename> extension.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>Download the <filename>.SYS</filename> and
	  <filename>.INF</filename> files for the specific
	  <acronym>NIC</acronym>.  Generally, these can be found on
	  the driver CD or at the vendor's website.  The following
	  examples use <filename>W32DRIVER.SYS</filename> and
	  <filename>W32DRIVER.INF</filename>.</para>

	<para>The driver bit width must match the version of &os;.
	  For &os;/i386, use a &windows; 32-bit driver.  For
	  &os;/amd64, a &windows; 64-bit driver is needed.</para>

	<para>The next step is to compile the driver binary into a
	  loadable kernel module.  As
	  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, use
	  &man.ndisgen.8;:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ndisgen <replaceable>/path/to/W32DRIVER.INF</replaceable> <replaceable>/path/to/W32DRIVER.SYS</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>This command is interactive and prompts for any extra
	  information it requires.  A new kernel module will be
	  generated in the current directory.  Use &man.kldload.8;
	  to load the new module:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload <replaceable>./W32DRIVER_SYS.ko</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>In addition to the generated kernel module, the
	  <filename>ndis.ko</filename> and
	  <filename>if_ndis.ko</filename> modules must be loaded.
	  This should happen automatically when any module that
	  depends on &man.ndis.4; is loaded.  If not, load them
	  manually, using the following commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ndis</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload if_ndis</userinput></screen>

	<para>The first command loads the &man.ndis.4; miniport driver
	  wrapper and the second loads the generated
	  <acronym>NIC</acronym> driver.</para>

	<para>Check &man.dmesg.8; to see if there were any load
	  errors.  If all went well, the output should be similar to
	  the following:</para>

	<screen>ndis0: &lt;Wireless-G PCI Adapter&gt; mem 0xf4100000-0xf4101fff irq 3 at device 8.0 on pci1

	<para>From here, <filename>ndis0</filename> can be
	  configured like any other <acronym>NIC</acronym>.</para>

	<para>To configure the system to load the &man.ndis.4; modules
	  at boot time, copy the generated module,
	  <filename>W32DRIVER_SYS.ko</filename>, to
	  <filename>/boot/modules</filename>.  Then, add the following

	<para>When troubleshooting hardware and software
	  configurations, check the simple things first.  Is the
	  network cable plugged in?  Are the network services properly
	  configured?  Is the firewall configured correctly?  Is the
	  <acronym>NIC</acronym> supported by &os;?  Before sending
	  a bug report, always check the Hardware Notes, update the
	  version of &os; to the latest STABLE version, check the
	  mailing list archives, and search the Internet.</para>

	<para>If the card works, yet performance is poor, read
	  through &man.tuning.7;.  Also, check the network
	  configuration as incorrect network settings can cause slow
	  connections.</para>

	<para>Some users experience one or two
	  <errorname>device timeout</errorname> messages, which is
	  normal for some cards.  If they continue, or are bothersome,
	  determine if the device is conflicting with another device.
	  Double check the cable connections.  Consider trying another
	  card.</para>

	<para>To resolve <errorname>watchdog timeout</errorname>
	  errors,  first check the network cable.  Many cards
	  require a <acronym>PCI</acronym> slot which supports bus
	  mastering.  On some old motherboards, only one
	  <acronym>PCI</acronym> slot allows it, usually slot 0.
	  Check the <acronym>NIC</acronym> and the motherboard
	  documentation to determine if that may be the
	  problem.</para>

	<para><errorname>No route to host</errorname> messages occur
	  if the system is unable to route a packet to the destination
	  host.  This can happen if no default route is specified or
	  if a cable is unplugged.  Check the output of
	  <command>netstat -rn</command> and make sure there is a
	  valid route to the host.  If there is not, read
	  <xref linkend="advanced-networking"/>.</para>

	<para><errorname>ping: sendto: Permission denied</errorname>
	  error messages are often caused by a misconfigured firewall.
	  If a firewall is enabled on &os; but no rules have been
	  defined, the default policy is to deny all traffic, even
	  &man.ping.8;.  Refer to
	  <xref linkend="firewalls"/> for more information.</para>

	<para>Sometimes performance of the card is poor or below
	  average.  In these cases, try setting the media
	  selection mode from <literal>autoselect</literal> to the
	  correct media selection.  While this works for most
	  hardware, it may or may not resolve the issue.  Again,
	  check all the network settings, and refer to

      <literal>alias0</literal>, <literal>alias1</literal>,
      and so on.  The configuration process will stop at the first
      missing number.</para>

    <para>The calculation of alias netmasks is important.  For a
      given interface, there must be one address which correctly
      represents the network's netmask.  Any other addresses which
      fall within this network must have a netmask of all
      <literal>1</literal>s, expressed as either
      <systemitem class="netmask">255.255.255.255</systemitem> or
      <systemitem class="netmask">0xffffffff</systemitem>.</para>

    <para>For example, consider the case where the
      <filename>fxp0</filename> interface is connected to two
      networks: <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.1.1.0</systemitem>
      with a netmask of
      <systemitem class="netmask">255.255.255.0</systemitem> and
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">202.0.75.16</systemitem> with a
      netmask of
      <systemitem class="netmask">255.255.255.240</systemitem>.  The
      system is to be configured to appear in the ranges
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.1.1.1</systemitem> through
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.1.1.5</systemitem> and
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">202.0.75.17</systemitem> through
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">202.0.75.20</systemitem>.  Only
      the first address in a given network range should have a real
      netmask.  All the rest
      (<systemitem class="ipaddress">10.1.1.2</systemitem> through
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.1.1.5</systemitem> and
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">202.0.75.18</systemitem> through
      <systemitem class="ipaddress">202.0.75.20</systemitem>) must be
      configured with a netmask of
      <systemitem class="netmask">255.255.255.255</systemitem>.</para>

    <para>The following <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> entries
      configure the adapter correctly for this scenario:</para>

    <programlisting>ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.255"

    <para>Generating and reading system logs is an important aspect of
      system administration.  The information in system logs can be
      used to detect hardware and software issues as well as
      application and system configuration errors.  This information
      also plays an important role in security auditing and incident
      response.  Most system daemons and applications will generate
      log entries.</para>

    <para>&os; provides a system logger,
      <application>syslogd</application>, to manage logging.  By
      default, <application>syslogd</application> is started when the
      system boots.  This is controlled by the variable
      <literal>syslogd_enable</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  There are numerous
      application arguments that can be set using
      <literal>syslogd_flags</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Refer to &man.syslogd.8; for
      more information on the available arguments.</para>

    <para>This section describes how to configure the &os; system
      logger for both local and remote logging and how to perform log
      rotation and log management.</para>

      <title>Configuring Local Logging</title>

      <indexterm><primary>syslog.conf</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The configuration file,
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>, controls what
	<application>syslogd</application> does with log entries as
	they are received.  There are several parameters to control
	the handling of incoming events.  The
	<firstterm>facility</firstterm> describes which subsystem
	generated the message, such as the kernel or a daemon, and the
	<firstterm>level</firstterm> describes the severity of the
	event that occurred.  This makes it possible to configure if
	and where a log message is logged, depending on the facility
	and level.  It is also possible to take action depending on
	the application that sent the message, and in the case of
	remote logging, the hostname of the machine generating the
	logging event.</para>

      <para>This configuration file contains one line per action,
	where the syntax for each line is a selector field followed by
	an action field.  The syntax of the selector field is
	<replaceable>facility.level</replaceable> which will match log
	messages from <replaceable>facility</replaceable> at level
	<replaceable>level</replaceable> or higher.  It is also
	possible to add an optional comparison flag before the level
	to specify more precisely what is logged.  Multiple selector
	fields can be used for the same action, and are separated with
	a semicolon (<literal>;</literal>).  Using
	<literal>*</literal> will match everything.  The action field
	denotes where to send the log message, such as to a file or
	remote log host.  As an example, here is the default
	<filename>syslog.conf</filename> from &os;:</para>

#       Spaces ARE valid field separators in this file. However,
#       other *nix-like systems still insist on using tabs as field
#       separators. If you are sharing this file between systems, you
#       may want to use only tabs as field separators here.

      <indexterm><primary>log management</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Log files can grow quickly, taking up disk space and
	making it more difficult to locate useful information.  Log
	management attempts to mitigate this.  In &os;,
	<application>newsyslog</application> is used to manage log
	files.  This built-in program periodically rotates and
	compresses log files, and optionally creates missing log files
	and signals programs when log files are moved.  The log files
	may be generated by <application>syslogd</application> or by
	any other program which generates log files.  While
	<application>newsyslog</application> is normally run from
	&man.cron.8;, it is not a system daemon.  In the default
	configuration, it runs every hour.</para>

      <para>To know which actions to take,
	<application>newsyslog</application> reads its configuration
	file, <filename>/etc/newsyslog.conf</filename>.  This file
	contains one line for each log file that
	<application>newsyslog</application> manages.  Each line
	states the file owner, permissions, when to rotate that file,
	optional flags that affect log rotation, such as compression,
	and programs to signal when the log is rotated.  Here is the
	default configuration in &os;:</para>

      <programlisting># configuration file for newsyslog
# $FreeBSD$
#
# Entries which do not specify the '/pid_file' field will cause the
# syslogd process to be signalled when that log file is rotated.  This
# action is only appropriate for log files which are written to by the
# syslogd process (ie, files listed in /etc/syslog.conf).  If there
# is no process which needs to be signalled when a given log file is
# rotated, then the entry for that file should include the 'N' flag.
#
# The 'flags' field is one or more of the letters: BCDGJNUXZ or a '-'.
#
# Note: some sites will want to select more restrictive protections than the
# defaults.  In particular, it may be desirable to switch many of the 644
# entries to 640 or 600.  For example, some sites will consider the
# contents of maillog, messages, and lpd-errs to be confidential.  In the
# future, these defaults may change to more conservative ones.

      <para>Each line starts with the name of the log to be rotated,
	optionally followed by an owner and group for both rotated and
	newly created files.  The <literal>mode</literal> field sets
	the permissions on the log file and <literal>count</literal>
	denotes how many rotated log files should be kept.  The
	<literal>size</literal> and <literal>when</literal> fields
	tell <application>newsyslog</application> when to rotate the
	file.  A log file is rotated when either its size is larger
	than the <literal>size</literal> field or when the time in the
	<literal>when</literal> field has passed.  An asterisk
	(<literal>*</literal>) means that this field is ignored.  The
	<replaceable>flags</replaceable> field gives further
	instructions, such as how to compress the rotated file or to
	create the log file if it is missing.  The last two fields are
	optional and specify the name of the Process ID
	(<acronym>PID</acronym>) file of a process and a signal number
	to send to that process when the file is rotated.</para>

      <para>For more information on all fields, valid flags, and how

      <para>In &os;, centralized log file aggregation, merging, and

	<application>syslogd</application> and
	<application>newsyslog</application>.  This section
	demonstrates an example configuration, where host

	  class="fqdomainname">logserv.example.com</systemitem>, will
	collect logging information for the local network.  Host
	<systemitem>B</systemitem>, named <systemitem
	  class="fqdomainname">logclient.example.com</systemitem>,
	will be configured to pass logging information to the logging
	server.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Log Server Configuration</title>

	<para>A log server is a system that has been configured to
	  accept logging information from other hosts.  Before
	  configuring a log server, check the following:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If there is a firewall between the logging server
	      and any logging clients, ensure that the firewall
	      ruleset allows <acronym>UDP</acronym> port 514 for both
	      the clients and the server.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The logging server and all client  machines must
	      have forward and reverse entries in the local
	      <acronym>DNS</acronym>.  If the network does not have a
	      <acronym>DNS</acronym> server, create entries in each
	      system's <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>.  Proper name
	      resolution is required so that log entries are not
	      rejected by the logging server.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>On the log server, edit
	  <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> to specify the name of
	  the client to receive log entries from, the logging facility
	  to be used, and the name of the log to store the host's log
	  entries.  This example adds the hostname of
	  <systemitem>B</systemitem>, logs all facilities, and stores
	  the log entries in
	  <filename>/var/log/logclient.log</filename>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Sample Log Server Configuration</title>

	  <programlisting>+logclient.example.com
*.*     /var/log/logclient.log</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>When adding multiple log clients, add a similar two-line
	  entry for each client.  More information about the available
	  facilities may be found in &man.syslog.conf.5;.</para>

	<para>Next, configure
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>syslogd_enable="YES"
syslogd_flags="-a logclient.example.com -v -v"</programlisting>

	<para>The first entry starts
	  <application>syslogd</application> at system boot.  The
	  second entry allows log entries from the specified client.
	  The <option>-v -v</option> increases the verbosity of logged
	  messages.  This is useful for tweaking facilities as
	  administrators are able to see what type of messages are
	  being logged under each facility.</para>

	<para>Multiple <option>-a</option> options may be specified to
	  allow logging from multiple clients.  <acronym>IP</acronym>
	  addresses and whole netblocks may also be specified.  Refer
	  to &man.syslogd.8; for a full list of possible
	  options.</para>

	<para>Finally, create the log file:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch /var/log/logclient.log</userinput></screen>

	<title>Log Client Configuration</title>

	<para>A logging client sends log entries to a logging server
	  on the network.  The client also keeps a local copy of its
	  own logs.</para>

	<para>Once a logging server has been configured, edit
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> on the logging
	  client:</para>

	<programlisting>syslogd_enable="YES"
syslogd_flags="-s -v -v"</programlisting>

	<para>The first entry enables
	  <application>syslogd</application> on boot up.  The second
	  entry prevents logs from being accepted by this client from
	  other hosts (<option>-s</option>) and increases the
	  verbosity of logged messages.</para>

	<para>Next, define the logging server in the client's
	  <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>.  In this example, all
	  logged facilities are sent to a remote system, denoted by
	  the <literal>@</literal> symbol, with the specified
	  hostname:</para>

	<programlisting>*.*		@logserv.example.com</programlisting>

	<para>After saving the edit, restart
	  <application>syslogd</application> for the changes to take
	  effect:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service syslogd restart</userinput></screen>

	<para>To test that log messages are being sent across the

	  to <application>syslogd</application>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>logger "<replaceable>Test message from logclient</replaceable>"</userinput></screen>

	<para>This message should now exist both in

	<title>Debugging Log Servers</title>

	<para>If no messages are being received on the log server, the
	  cause is most likely a network connectivity issue, a
	  hostname resolution issue, or a typo in a configuration
	  file.  To isolate the cause, ensure that both the logging
	  server and the logging client are able to
	  <command>ping</command> each other using the hostname
	  specified in their <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  If
	  this fails, check the network cabling, the firewall ruleset,
	  and the hostname entries in the <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	  server or <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> on both the
	  logging server and clients.  Repeat until the
	  <command>ping</command> is successful from both
	  hosts.</para>

	<para>If the <command>ping</command> succeeds on both hosts
	  but log messages are still not being received, temporarily
	  increase logging verbosity to narrow down the configuration
	  issue.  In the following example,
	  <filename>/var/log/logclient.log</filename> on the logging
	  server is empty and <filename>/var/log/messages</filename>
	  on the logging client does not indicate a reason for the
	  failure.  To increase debugging output, edit the
	  <literal>syslogd_flags</literal> entry on the logging server
	  and issue a restart:</para>

	<programlisting>syslogd_flags="-d -a logclien.example.com -v -v"</programlisting>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service syslogd restart</userinput></screen>

	<para>Debugging data similar to the following will flash on
	  the console immediately after the restart:</para>

	<para>In this example, the log messages are being rejected due
	  to a typo which results in a hostname mismatch.  The
	  client's hostname should be <literal>logclient</literal>,
	  not <literal>logclien</literal>.  Fix the typo, issue a

	<title>Security Considerations</title>

	<para>As with any network service, security requirements
	  should be considered before implementing a logging server.
	  Log files may contain sensitive data about services enabled
	  on the local host, user accounts, and configuration data.
	  Network data sent from the client to the server will not be
	  encrypted or password protected.  If a need for encryption
	  exists, consider using <package>security/stunnel</package>,
	  which will transmit the logging data over an encrypted
	  tunnel.</para>

	<para>Local security is also an issue.  Log files are not
	  encrypted during use or after log rotation.  Local users may
	  access log files to gain additional insight into system
	  configuration.  Setting proper permissions on log files is
	  critical.  The built-in log rotator,
	  <application>newsyslog</application>, supports setting
	  permissions on newly created and rotated log files.  Setting
	  log files to mode <literal>600</literal> should prevent
	  unwanted access by local users.  Refer to
	  &man.newsyslog.conf.5; for additional information.</para>

	  variable
	  may be set to either <literal>0</literal> (off) or
	  <literal>1</literal> (on).  It is set to
	  <literal>1</literal> by default.  This variable controls
	  how directories are cached by the system.  Most directories
	  are small, using just a single fragment (typically 1&nbsp;K)
	  in the file system and typically 512&nbsp;bytes in the
	  buffer cache.  With this variable turned off, the buffer
	  cache will only cache a fixed number of directories, even
	  if the system has a huge amount of memory.  When turned on,
	  this &man.sysctl.8; allows the buffer cache to use the
	  <acronym>VM</acronym> page cache to cache the directories,
	  making all the memory available for caching directories.
	  However, the minimum in-core memory used to cache a
	  directory is the physical page size (typically 4&nbsp;K)
	  rather than 512&nbsp; bytes.  Keeping this option enabled
	  is recommended if the system is running any services which
	  manipulate large numbers of files.  Such services can
	  include web caches, large mail systems, and news systems.
	  Keeping this option on will generally not reduce
	  performance, even with the wasted memory, but one should
	  experiment to find out.</para>

	  defaults to <literal>1</literal> (on).  This tells the file
	  system to issue media writes as full clusters are collected,
	  which typically occurs when writing large sequential files.
	  This avoids saturating the buffer cache with dirty buffers
	  when it would not benefit I/O performance.  However, this

	<para>The <varname>vfs.hirunningspace</varname> &man.sysctl.8;
	  variable determines how much outstanding write I/O may be
	  queued to disk controllers system-wide at any given
	  instance.  The default is usually sufficient, but on
	  machines with many disks, try bumping it up to four or five
	  <emphasis>megabytes</emphasis>.  Setting too high a value
	  which exceeds the buffer cache's write threshold can lead
	  to bad clustering performance.  Do not set this value
	  arbitrarily high as higher write values may add latency to
	  reads occurring at the same time.</para>

	<para>There are various other buffer cache and
	  <acronym>VM</acronym> page cache related &man.sysctl.8;

	<para>The <varname>vm.swap_idle_enabled</varname>
	  &man.sysctl.8; variable is useful in large multi-user
	  systems with many active login users and lots of idle
	  processes.  Such systems tend to generate continuous
	  pressure on free memory reserves.  Turning this feature on
	  and tweaking the swapout hysteresis (in idle seconds) via
	  <varname>vm.swap_idle_threshold1</varname> and
	  <varname>vm.swap_idle_threshold2</varname> depresses the
	  priority of memory pages associated with idle processes more
	  quickly then the normal pageout algorithm.  This gives a
	  helping hand to the pageout daemon.  Only turn this option
	  on if needed, because the tradeoff is essentially pre-page
	  memory sooner rather than later which eats more swap and
	  disk bandwidth.  In a small system this option will have a
	  determinable effect, but in a large system that is already
	  doing moderate paging, this option allows the
	  <acronym>VM</acronym> system to stage whole processes into
	  and out of memory easily.</para>

	<para>Turning off <acronym>IDE</acronym> write caching reduces

	  turned on, <acronym>IDE</acronym> hard drives write data

      <para>To fine-tune a file system, use &man.tunefs.8;.  This

	on and off, use:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>tunefs -n enable /filesystem</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tunefs -n disable /filesystem</userinput></screen>

      <para>A file system cannot be modified with &man.tunefs.8; while

	any partitions have been mounted, in single-user mode.</para>

      <para>Soft Updates is recommended for <acronym>UFS</acronym>
	file systems as it drastically improves meta-data performance,
	mainly file creation and deletion, through the use of a memory
	cache.  There are two downsides to Soft Updates to be aware
	of.  First, Soft Updates guarantee file system consistency
	in the case of a crash, but could easily be several seconds
	or even a minute behind updating the physical disk.  If the
	system crashes, unwritten data may be lost.  Secondly, Soft
	Updates delay the freeing of file system blocks.  If the
	root file system is almost full, performing a major update,
	such as <command>make installworld</command>, can cause the
	file system to run out of space and the update to fail.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>More Details About Soft Updates</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>Soft Updates</primary>
	  <secondary>details</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>Meta-data updates are updates to non-content data like
	  inodes or directories.  There are two traditional approaches
	  to writing a file system's meta-data back to disk.</para>

	<para>Historically, the default behavior was to write out
	  meta-data updates synchronously.  If a directory changed,
	  the system waited until the change was actually written to
	  disk.  The file data buffers (file contents) were passed
	  through the buffer cache and backed up to disk later on
	  asynchronously.  The advantage of this implementation is
	  that it operates safely.  If there is a failure during an
	  update, meta-data is always in a consistent state.  A
	  file is either created completely or not at all.  If the
	  data blocks of a file did not find their way out of the
	  buffer cache onto the disk by the time of the crash,
	  &man.fsck.8; recognizes this and repairs the file system
	  by setting the file length to <literal>0</literal>.
	  Additionally, the implementation is clear and simple.  The
	  disadvantage is that meta-data changes are slow.  For
	  example, <command>rm -r</command> touches all the files in a
	  directory sequentially, but each directory change will be
	  written synchronously to the disk.  This includes updates to
	  the directory itself, to the inode table, and possibly to
	  indirect blocks allocated by the file.  Similar
	  considerations apply for unrolling large hierarchies using
	  <command>tar -x</command>.</para>

	<para>The second approach is to use asynchronous meta-data
	  updates.  This is the default for a <acronym>UFS</acronym>
	  file system mounted with <command>mount -o async</command>.
	  Since all meta-data updates are also passed through the
	  buffer cache, they will be intermixed with the updates of
	  the file content data.  The advantage of this
	  implementation is there is no need to wait until each
	  meta-data update has been written to disk, so all operations
	  which cause huge amounts of meta-data updates work much
	  faster than in the synchronous case.  This implementation
	  is still clear and simple, so there is a low risk for bugs
	  creeping into the code.  The disadvantage is that there is
	  no guarantee for a consistent state of the file system.
	  If there is a failure during an operation that updated
	  large amounts of meta-data, like a power failure or someone
	  pressing the reset button, the file system will be left
	  in an unpredictable state.  There is no opportunity to
	  examine the state of the file system when the system comes
	  up again as the data blocks of a file could already have
	  been written to the disk while the updates of the inode
	  table or the associated directory were not.  It is
	  impossible to implement a &man.fsck.8; which is able to
	  clean up the resulting chaos because the necessary
	  information is not available on the disk.  If the file
	  system has been damaged beyond repair, the only choice
	  is to reformat it and restore from backup.</para>

	<para>The usual solution for this problem is to implement
	  <emphasis>dirty region logging</emphasis>, which is also
	  referred to as <emphasis>journaling</emphasis>.
	  Meta-data updates are still written synchronously, but only
	  into a small region of the disk.  Later on, they are moved
	  to their proper location.  Because the logging area is a
	  small, contiguous region on the disk, there are no long
	  distances for the disk heads to move, even during heavy
	  operations, so these operations are quicker than synchronous
	  updates.  Additionally, the complexity of the implementation
	  is limited, so the risk of bugs being present is low.  A
	  disadvantage is that all meta-data is written twice, once
	  into the logging region and once to the proper location, so
	  performance <quote>pessimization</quote> might result.  On
	  the other hand, in case of a crash, all pending meta-data
	  operations can be either quickly rolled back or completed
	  from the logging area after the system comes up again,
	  resulting in a fast file system startup.</para>

	<para>Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley
	  <acronym>FFS</acronym>, solved this problem with Soft
	  Updates.  All pending meta-data updates are kept in memory
	  and written out to disk in a sorted sequence
	  (<quote>ordered meta-data updates</quote>).  This has the
	  effect that, in case of heavy meta-data operations, later
	  updates to an item <quote>catch</quote> the earlier ones
	  which are still in memory and have not already been written
	  to disk.  All operations are generally performed in memory
	  before the update is written to disk and the data blocks are
	  sorted according to their position so that they will not be
	  on the disk ahead of their meta-data.  If the system
	  crashes, an implicit <quote>log rewind</quote> causes all
	  operations which were not written to the disk appear as if
	  they never happened.  A consistent file system state is
	  maintained that appears to be the one of 30 to 60 seconds
	  earlier.  The algorithm used guarantees that all resources
	  in use are marked as such in their blocks and inodes.
	  After a crash, the only resource allocation error that
	  occurs is that resources are marked as <quote>used</quote>
	  which are actually <quote>free</quote>.  &man.fsck.8;
	  recognizes this situation, and frees the resources that
	  are no longer used.  It is safe to ignore the dirty state
	  of the file system after a crash by forcibly mounting it
	  with <command>mount -f</command>.  In order to free
	  resources that may be unused, &man.fsck.8; needs to be run
	  at a later time.  This is the idea behind the
	  <emphasis>background &man.fsck.8;</emphasis>: at system
	  startup time, only a <emphasis>snapshot</emphasis> of the
	  file system is recorded and &man.fsck.8; is run afterwards.
	  All file systems can then be mounted
	  <quote>dirty</quote>, so the system startup proceeds in
	  multi-user mode.  Then, background &man.fsck.8; is
	  scheduled for all file systems where this is required, to
	  free resources that may be unused.  File systems that do
	  not use Soft Updates still need the usual foreground
	  &man.fsck.8;.</para>

	<para>The advantage is that meta-data operations are nearly
	  as fast as asynchronous updates and are faster than
	  <emphasis>logging</emphasis>, which has to write the
	  meta-data twice.  The disadvantages are the complexity of
	  the code, a higher memory consumption, and some
	  idiosyncrasies.  After a crash, the state of the file
	  system appears to be somewhat <quote>older</quote>.  In
	  situations where the standard synchronous approach would
	  have caused some zero-length files to remain after the
	  &man.fsck.8;, these files do not exist at all with Soft
	  Updates because neither the meta-data nor the file contents
	  have been written to disk.  Disk space is not released until
	  the updates have been written to disk, which may take place
	  some time after running &man.rm.1;.  This may cause problems
	  when installing large amounts of data on a file system
	  that does not have enough free space to hold all the files
	  twice.</para>

	<para>The <varname>kern.maxfiles</varname> &man.sysctl.8;

	  requirements.  This variable indicates the maximum number
	  of file descriptors on the system.  When the file descriptor
	  table is full, <errorname>file: table is full</errorname>
	  will show up repeatedly in the system message buffer, which
	  can be viewed using &man.dmesg.8;.</para>

	<para>Each open file, socket, or fifo uses one file
	  descriptor.  A large-scale production server may easily
	  require many thousands of file descriptors, depending on the
	  kind and number of services running concurrently.</para>

	<para>In older &os; releases, the default value of
	  <varname>kern.maxfiles</varname> is derived from
	  <option>maxusers</option> in the kernel configuration file.
	  <varname>kern.maxfiles</varname> grows proportionally to the
	  value of <option>maxusers</option>.  When compiling a custom
	  kernel, consider setting this kernel configuration option
	  according to the use of the system.  From this number, the
	  kernel is given most of its pre-defined limits.  Even though
	  a production machine may not have 256 concurrent users, the
	  resources needed may be similar to a high-scale web
	  server.</para>

	<para>The read-only &man.sysctl.8; variable

	  boot based on the amount of memory available in the system,
	  and may be determined at run-time by inspecting the value
	  of <varname>kern.maxusers</varname>.  Some systems require
	  larger or smaller values of
	  <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> and values of
	  <literal>64</literal>, <literal>128</literal>, and
	  <literal>256</literal> are not uncommon.  Going above

	      <literal>384</literal>.</para></footnote>.  When
	  setting this option, set <literal>maxusers</literal> to
	  at least <literal>4</literal>, especially if the system
	  runs <application>&xorg;</application> or is used to
	  compile software.  The most important table set by
	  <literal>maxusers</literal> is the maximum number of
	  processes, which is set to
	  <literal>20 + 16 * maxusers</literal>.  If
	  <literal>maxusers</literal> is set to <literal>1</literal>,
	  there can only be
	  <literal>36</literal> simultaneous processes, including
	  the <literal>18</literal> or so that the system starts up
	  at boot time and the <literal>15</literal> or so used by
	  <application>&xorg;</application>.  Even a simple task like
	  reading a manual page will start up nine processes to
	  filter, decompress, and view it.  Setting
	  <literal>maxusers</literal> to <literal>64</literal> allows
	  up to <literal>1044</literal> simultaneous processes, which

      <para>The <literal>NMBCLUSTERS</literal> kernel configuration

	  &man.sysctl.8; variables control the port number ranges
	  automatically bound to <literal>TCP</literal> and
	  <literal>UDP</literal> sockets.  There are three ranges: a

	  programs use the default range which is controlled by

	  <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.last</varname>, which default
	  to <literal>1024</literal> and <literal>5000</literal>,
	  respectively.  Bound port ranges are used for outgoing
	  connections and it is possible to run the system out of
	  ports under certain circumstances.  This most commonly
	  occurs when running a heavily loaded web proxy.  The port
	  range is not an issue when running a server which handles
	  mainly incoming connections, such as a web server, or has
	  a limited number of outgoing connections, such as a mail

	<para>This feature is useful when serving data over modems,

    <para>It is important to utilize hardware resources in an
      efficient manner.  Power and resource management allows the
      operating system to monitor system limits and to possibly
      provide an alert if the system temperature increases
      unexpectedly.  An early specification for providing power
      management was the Advanced Power Management
      (<acronym>APM</acronym>) facility.  <acronym>APM</acronym>
      controls the power usage of a system based on its activity.
      However, it was difficult and inflexible for operating systems
      to manage the power usage and thermal properties of a system.
      The hardware was managed by the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and the
      user had limited configurability and visibility into the power
      management settings.  The <acronym>APM</acronym>
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym> is supplied by the vendor and is
      specific to the hardware platform.  An <acronym>APM</acronym>
      driver in the operating system mediates access to the
      <acronym>APM</acronym> Software Interface, which allows
      management of power levels.</para>

    <para>There are four major problems in <acronym>APM</acronym>.
      First, power management is done by the vendor-specific
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym>, separate from the operating system.
      For example, the user can set idle-time values for a hard drive
      in the <acronym>APM</acronym> <acronym>BIOS</acronym> so that,
      when exceeded, the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> spins down the hard
      drive without the consent of the operating system.  Second, the
      <acronym>APM</acronym> logic is embedded in the
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym>, and it operates outside the scope of
      the operating system.  This means that users can only fix
      problems in the <acronym>APM</acronym>
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym> by flashing a new one into the
      <acronym>ROM</acronym>, which is a dangerous procedure with the
      potential to leave the system in an unrecoverable state if it
      fails.  Third, <acronym>APM</acronym> is a vendor-specific
      technology, meaning that there is a lot of duplication of
      efforts and bugs found in one vendor's <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
      may not be solved in others.  Lastly, the <acronym>APM</acronym>
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym> did not have enough room to implement a
      sophisticated power policy or one that can adapt well to the
      purpose of the machine.</para>

    <para>The Plug and Play <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
      (<acronym>PNPBIOS</acronym>) was unreliable in many situations.
      <acronym>PNPBIOS</acronym> is 16-bit technology, so the
      operating system has to use 16-bit emulation in order to
      interface with <acronym>PNPBIOS</acronym> methods.  &os;
      provides an <acronym>APM</acronym> driver as
      <acronym>APM</acronym> should still be used for systems
      manufactured at or before the year 2000.  The driver is
      documented in &man.apm.4;.</para>

    <para>The successor to <acronym>APM</acronym> is the Advanced
      Configuration and Power Interface (<acronym>ACPI</acronym>).
      <acronym>ACPI</acronym> is a standard written by an alliance of
      vendors to provide an interface for hardware resources and power
      management.  It is a key element in <emphasis>Operating
	System-directed configuration and Power Management</emphasis>
      as it provides more control and flexibility to the operating
      system.</para>

    <para>This chapter demonstrates how to configure
      <acronym>ACPI</acronym> on &os;.  It then offers some tips on
      how to debug <acronym>ACPI</acronym> and how to submit a problem
      report containing debugging information so that developers can
      diagnosis and fix <acronym>ACPI</acronym> issues.</para>

      <title>Configuring <acronym>ACPI</acronym></title>

      <para>In &os; the &man.acpi.4; driver is loaded by default at
	system boot and should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be compiled
	into the kernel.  This driver cannot be unloaded after boot

      <para><acronym>ACPI</acronym> is present in all modern computers
	that conform to the ia32 (x86), ia64 (Itanium), and amd64
	(<acronym>AMD</acronym>) architectures.  The full standard has
	many features including <acronym>CPU</acronym> performance
	management, power planes control, thermal zones, various
	battery systems, embedded controllers, and bus enumeration.
	Most systems implement less than the full standard.  For
	instance, a desktop system usually only implements bus
	enumeration while a laptop might have cooling and battery
	management support as well.  Laptops also have suspend and
	resume, with their own associated complexity.</para>

      <para>An <acronym>ACPI</acronym>-compliant system has various
	components.  The <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and chipset vendors
	provide various fixed tables, such as <acronym>FADT</acronym>,
	in memory that specify things like the <acronym>APIC</acronym>
	map (used for <acronym>SMP</acronym>), config registers, and
	simple configuration values.  Additionally, a bytecode table,
	the Differentiated System Description Table
	<acronym>DSDT</acronym>, specifies a tree-like name space of
	devices and methods.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>ACPI</acronym> driver must parse the fixed

      <sect3>
	<title>Suspend/Resume</title>

	<para><acronym>ACPI</acronym> has three suspend to
	  <acronym>RAM</acronym> (<acronym>STR</acronym>) states,
	  <literal>S1</literal>-<literal>S3</literal>, and one suspend
	  to disk state (<acronym>STD</acronym>), called
	  <literal>S4</literal>.  <acronym>STD</acronym> can be
	  implemented in two separate ways.  The
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>BIOS</acronym> is a
	  <acronym>BIOS</acronym>-assisted suspend to disk and
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>OS</acronym> is implemented
	  entirely by the operating system.  The normal state the
	  system is in when plugged in but not powered up is
	  <quote>soft off</quote> (<literal>S5</literal>).</para>

	<para>Use <command>sysctl hw.acpi</command> to check for the
	  suspend-related items.  These example results are from a
	  Thinkpad:</para>

	<screen>hw.acpi.supported_sleep_state: S3 S4 S5
hw.acpi.s4bios: 0</screen>

	<para>Use <command>acpiconf -s</command> to test
	  <literal>S3</literal>, <literal>S4</literal>, and
	  <literal>S5</literal>.  An <option>s4bios</option> of one
	  (<literal>1</literal>) indicates
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>BIOS</acronym> support instead
	  of <literal>S4</literal> operating system support.</para>

	<para>When testing suspend/resume, start with
	  <literal>S1</literal>, if supported.  This state is most
	  likely to work since it does not require much driver
	  support.  No one has implemented <literal>S2</literal>,
	  which is similar to <literal>S1</literal>.  Next, try
	  <literal>S3</literal>.  This is the deepest
	  <acronym>STR</acronym> state and requires a lot of driver
	  support to properly reinitialize the hardware.</para>

	<para>A common problem with suspend/resume is that many device
	  drivers do not save, restore, or reinitialize their
	  firmware, registers, or device memory properly.  As a first
	  attempt at debugging the problem, try:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl debug.bootverbose=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl debug.acpi.suspend_bounce=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>acpiconf -s 3</userinput></screen>

	<para>This test emulates the suspend/resume cycle of all
	  device drivers without actually going into
	  <literal>S3</literal> state.  In some cases, problems such
	  as losing firmware state, device watchdog time out, and
	  retrying forever, can be captured with this method.  Note
	  that the system will not really enter <literal>S3</literal>
	  state, which means devices may not lose power, and many
	  will work fine even if suspend/resume methods are totally
	  missing, unlike real <literal>S3</literal> state.</para>

	<para>Harder cases require additional hardware, such as a
	  serial port and cable for debugging through a serial
	  console, a Firewire port and cable for using &man.dcons.4;,
	  and kernel debugging skills.</para>

	<para>To help isolate the problem, unload as many drivers as
	  possible.  If it works, narrow down which driver is the
	  problem by loading drivers until it fails again.  Typically,
	  binary drivers like <filename>nvidia.ko</filename>, display
	  drivers, and <acronym>USB</acronym> will have the most
	  problems while Ethernet interfaces usually work fine.  If
	  drivers can be properly loaded and unloaded, automate this
	  by putting the appropriate commands in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.suspend</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.resume</filename>.  Try setting
	  <option>hw.acpi.reset_video</option> to <literal>1</literal>
	  if the display is messed up after resume.  Try setting
	  longer or shorter values for
	  <option>hw.acpi.sleep_delay</option> to see if that
	  helps.</para>

	<para>Try loading a recent &linux; distribution to see if
	  suspend/resume works on the same hardware.  If it works on
	  &linux;, it is likely a &os; driver problem.  Narrowing down
	  which driver causes the problem will assist developers in
	  fixing the problem.  Since the <acronym>ACPI</acronym>
	  maintainers rarely maintain other drivers, such as sound
	  or <acronym>ATA</acronym>, any driver problems should also
	  be posted to the &a.current.name; list and mailed to the
	  driver maintainer.  Advanced users can include debugging
	  &man.printf.3;s in a problematic driver to track down where
	  in its resume function it hangs.</para>

	<para>Finally, try disabling <acronym>ACPI</acronym> and
	  enabling <acronym>APM</acronym> instead.  If suspend/resume
	  works with <acronym>APM</acronym>, stick with
	  <acronym>APM</acronym>, especially on older hardware
	  (pre-2000).  It took vendors a while to get
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> support correct and older hardware
	  is more likely to have <acronym>BIOS</acronym> problems with
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym>.</para>

	<title>System Hangs</title>

	<para>Most system hangs are a result of lost interrupts or an

	<para>Interrupt storms can be distinguished from lost

	  storm.  If the system appears hung, try breaking to
	  <acronym>DDB</acronym> (<keycombo action="simul">
	    <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
	    <keycap>ALT</keycap>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Panics</title>

	<para>Panics are relatively rare for <acronym>ACPI</acronym>
	  and are the top priority to be fixed.  The first step is to
	  isolate the steps to reproduce the panic, if possible, and
	  get a backtrace.  Follow the advice for enabling
	  <literal>options DDB</literal> and setting up a serial
	  console in <xref linkend="serialconsole-ddb"/> or setting
	  up a dump partition.  To get a backtrace in
	  <acronym>DDB</acronym>, use <literal>tr</literal>.  When
	  handwriting the backtrace, get at least the last five and
	  the top five lines in the trace.</para>

	<para>Then, try to isolate the problem by booting with
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> disabled.  If that works, isolate
	  the <acronym>ACPI</acronym> subsystem by using various
	  values of <option>debug.acpi.disable</option>.  See

	<para>First, try setting
	  <literal>hw.acpi.disable_on_poweroff="0"</literal> in
	  <filename>/boot/loader</filename>.  This keeps
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> from disabling various events during
	  the shutdown process.  Some systems need this value set to
	  <literal>1</literal> (the default) for the same reason.
	  This usually fixes the problem of a system powering up
	  spontaneously after a suspend or poweroff.</para>

	Workarounds are still being developed for common mistakes made

	<acronym>ASL</acronym> using the following command.  Warnings
	can usually be ignored, but errors are bugs that will usually
	prevent <acronym>ACPI</acronym> from working correctly.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>iasl -f <replaceable>my.asl</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Including <option>-f</option> forces creation of the
	<acronym>AML</acronym>, even if there are errors during
	compilation.  Some errors, such as missing return statements,
	are automatically worked around by the &os;
	interpreter.</para>

      <para>The default output filename for <command>iasl</command> is
	<filename>DSDT.aml</filename>.  Load this file instead of the
	<acronym>BIOS</acronym>'s buggy copy, which is still present
	in flash memory, by editing
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>acpi_dsdt_load="YES"
acpi_dsdt_name="/boot/DSDT.aml"</programlisting>

      <para>Be sure to copy <filename>DSDT.aml</filename> to
	<filename>/boot</filename>, then reboot the system.  If this
	fixes the problem, send a &man.diff.1; of the old and new
	<acronym>ASL</acronym> to &a.acpi.name; so that developers can
	work around the buggy behavior in
	<filename>acpica</filename>.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>ACPI</acronym> driver has a flexible
	debugging facility.  A set of subsystems and the level of
	verbosity can be specified.  The subsystems to debug are
	specified as layers and are broken down into components
	(<literal>ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS</literal>) and
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> hardware support
	(<literal>ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS</literal>).  The verbosity of
	debugging output is specified as the level and ranges from
	just report errors (<literal>ACPI_LV_ERROR</literal>) to
	everything (<literal>ACPI_LV_VERBOSE</literal>).  The level is
	a bitmask so multiple options can be set at once, separated by
	spaces.  In practice, a serial console should be used to log
	the output so it is not lost as the console message buffer
	flushes.  A full list of the individual layers and levels is
	found in &man.acpi.4;.</para>

      <para>Debugging output is not enabled by default.  To enable it,
	add <literal>options ACPI_DEBUG</literal> to the custom kernel
	configuration file if <acronym>ACPI</acronym> is compiled into
	the kernel.  Add <literal>ACPI_DEBUG=1</literal> to
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> to enable it globally.  If
	a module is used instead of a custom kernel, recompile just
	the <filename>acpi.ko</filename> module as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /sys/modules/acpi/acpi &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make ACPI_DEBUG=1</userinput></screen>

      <para>Copy the compiled <filename>acpi.ko</filename> to
	<filename>/boot/kernel</filename> and add the desired level
	and layer to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The
	entries in this example enable debug messages for all
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> components and hardware drivers and
	output error messages at the least verbose level:</para>

      <programlisting>debug.acpi.layer="ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS"
debug.acpi.level="ACPI_LV_ERROR"</programlisting>

      <para>If the required information is triggered by a specific
	event, such as a suspend and then resume, do not modify
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  Instead, use
	<command>sysctl</command> to specify the layer and level after
	booting and preparing the system for the specific event.  The
	variables which can be set using <command>sysctl</command> are
	named the same as the tunables in
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>Once the debugging information is gathered, it can be sent
	to &a.acpi.name; so that it can be used by the &os;
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> maintainers to identify the root cause
	of the problem and to develop a solution.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Before submitting debugging information to this mailing
	  list, ensure the latest <acronym>BIOS</acronym> version is
	  installed and, if available, the embedded controller
	  firmware version.</para>
      </note>

      <para>When submitting a problem report, include the following
	information:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Description of the buggy behavior, including system
	    type, model, and anything that causes the bug to appear.
	    Note as accurately as possible when the bug began
	    occurring if it is new.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The output of <command>dmesg</command> after running
	    <command>boot -v</command>, including any error messages
	    generated by the bug.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The <command>dmesg</command> output from <command>boot
	      -v</command> with <acronym>ACPI</acronym> disabled,
	    if disabling <acronym>ACPI</acronym> helps to fix the
	    problem.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Output from <command>sysctl hw.acpi</command>.  This
	    lists which features the system offers.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The <acronym>URL</acronym> to a pasted version of the
	    system's <acronym>ASL</acronym>.  Do
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> send the <acronym>ASL</acronym>
	    directly to the list as it can be very large.  Generate a
	    copy of the <acronym>ASL</acronym> by running this
	    command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>acpidump -dt &gt; <replaceable>name</replaceable>-<replaceable>system</replaceable>.asl</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Substitute the login name for
	    <replaceable>name</replaceable> and manufacturer/model for
	    <replaceable>system</replaceable>.  For example, use
	    <filename>njl-FooCo6000.asl</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Most &os; developers watch the &a.current;, but one should
	submit problems to &a.acpi.name; to be sure it is seen.  Be
	patient when waiting for a response.  If the bug is not
	immediately apparent, submit a <acronym>PR</acronym> using
	&man.send-pr.1;.  When entering a <acronym>PR</acronym>,
	include the same information as requested above.  This helps
	developers to track the problem and resolve it.  Do not send a
	<acronym>PR</acronym> without emailing &a.acpi.name; first as
	it is likely that the problem has been reported before.</para>

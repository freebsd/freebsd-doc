    <title>Gateways and Routes</title>

    <indexterm><primary>routing</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>gateway</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>

    <para>For one machine to be able to find another over a network,
      there must be a mechanism in place to describe how to get from
      one to the other.  This is called
      <firstterm>routing</firstterm>.  A <quote>route</quote> is a
      defined pair of addresses: a <quote>destination</quote> and a
      <quote>gateway</quote>.  The pair indicates that when trying
      to get to this <emphasis>destination</emphasis>, communicate
      through this <emphasis>gateway</emphasis>.  There are three
      types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, and
      <quote>default</quote>.  The <quote>default route</quote> is
      used if none of the other routes apply.  There are also three
      types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces (also called
      <quote>links</quote>), and Ethernet hardware
      (<acronym>MAC</acronym>) addresses.</para>

      <title>An Example</title>

	aspects of routing:</para>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The first two lines specify the default route, described
	in more detail in <xref linkend="network-routing-default"/>,
	and the <hostid>localhost</hostid> route.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>loopback device</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The interface (<literal>Netif</literal> column) that this
	routing table specifies to use for
	<literal>localhost</literal> is <devicename>lo0</devicename>,
	also known as the loopback device.  This says to keep all
	traffic for this destination internal, rather than sending it
	out over the network.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>Ethernet</primary>
	<secondary>MAC address</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The addresses beginning with <hostid
	  role="mac">0:e0:</hostid> are Ethernet hardware addresses,
	also known as <acronym>MAC</acronym> addresses.  &os; will
	automatically identify any hosts, <hostid>test0</hostid> in
	the example, on the local Ethernet and add a route for that
	host over the Ethernet interface,
	<devicename>ed0</devicename>.  This type of route has a
	timeout, seen in the <literal>Expire</literal> column, which
	is used if the host does not respond in a specific amount of
	time.  When this happens, the route to this host will be
	automatically deleted.  These hosts are identified using the
	Routing Information Protocol (<acronym>RIP</acronym>), which
	calculates routes to local hosts based upon a shortest path
	determination.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>

      <para>&os; will add subnet routes for the local subnet.
	<hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30.255</hostid> is the broadcast
	address for the subnet <hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid>
	and <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid> is the
	domain name associated with that subnet.  The designation
	<literal>link#1</literal> refers to the first Ethernet card in
	the machine.</para>

      <para>Local network hosts and local subnets have their routes
	automatically configured by a daemon called &man.routed.8;.
	If it is not running, only routes which are statically defined
	by the administrator will exist.</para>

      <para>The <literal>host1</literal> line refers to the host
	by its Ethernet address.  Since it is the sending host, &os;
	knows to use the loopback interface
	(<devicename>lo0</devicename>) rather than the Ethernet
	interface.</para>

      <para>The two <literal>host2</literal> lines represent aliases
	which were created using &man.ifconfig.8;.  The
	<literal>=&gt;</literal> symbol after the
	<devicename>lo0</devicename> interface says that an alias
	has been set in addition to the loopback address.  Such routes
	only show up on the host that supports the alias; all other
	hosts on the local network will have a
	<literal>link#1</literal> line for such routes.</para>

      <para>The final line (destination subnet <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">224</hostid>) deals with
	multicasting.</para>

      <para>Finally, various attributes of each route can be seen in
	the <literal>Flags</literal> column.  Below is a short table
	of some of these flags and their meanings:</para>

    <sect2 id="network-routing-default">
      <title>Default Routes</title>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>

      <para>When the local system needs to make a connection to a
	remote host, it checks the routing table to determine if a
	known path exists.  If the remote host falls into a subnet
	that it knows how to reach, the system checks to see if it
	can connect using that interface.</para>

      <para>If all known paths fail, the system has one last option:
	the <quote>default</quote> route.  This route is a special
	type of gateway route (usually the only one present in the
	system), and is always marked with a <literal>c</literal> in
	the flags field.  For hosts on a local area network, this
	gateway is set to the system which has a direct connection to
	the Internet.</para>

      <para>The default route for a machine which itself is
	functioning as the gateway to the outside world, will be the
	gateway machine at the Internet Service Provider
	(<acronym>ISP</acronym>).</para>

      <para>This example is a common configuration for a default
	route:</para>

      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata fileref="advanced-networking/net-routing"/>
	</imageobject>

	<textobject>
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">

	</textobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The hosts <hostid>Local1</hostid> and
	<hostid>Local2</hostid> are on the local network.
	<hostid>Local1</hostid> is connected to an
	<acronym>ISP</acronym> using a
	<acronym>PPP</acronym> connection.  This
	<acronym>PPP</acronym> server is connected through a local
	area network to another gateway computer through an external
	interface to the <acronym>ISP</acronym>.</para>

      <para>The default routes for each machine will be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="3">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>

	      <entry>PPP</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>A common question is <quote>Why is
	  <hostid>T1-GW</hostid> configured as the default gateway for
	  <hostid>Local1</hostid>, rather than the
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym> server it is connected
	  to?</quote>.</para>

      <para>Since the <acronym>PPP</acronym> interface is using an
	address on the <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s local network for
	the local side of the connection, routes for any other
	machines on the <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s local network will
	be automatically generated.  The system already knows how
	to reach the <hostid>T1-GW</hostid> machine, so there is no
	need for the intermediate step of sending traffic to the
	<acronym>ISP</acronym>'s server.</para>

      <para>It is common to use the address <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">X.X.X.1</hostid> as the gateway address for
	the local network.  So, if the local class C address space is
	<hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid> and the
	<acronym>ISP</acronym> is using <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.9.9</hostid>, the default routes would
	be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="2">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Route</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2 (10.20.30.2)</entry>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1)</entry>
	    </row>

	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1, 10.9.9.30)</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW (10.9.9.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>The default route can be easily defined in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  In this example, on
	<hostid>Local2</hostid>, add the following line to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>defaultrouter="10.20.30.1"</programlisting>

      <para>It is also possible to add the route directly using
	&man.route.8;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add default 10.20.30.1</userinput></screen>

      <para>For more information on manual manipulation of network
	routing tables, refer to &man.route.8;.</para>

    <sect2 id="network-dual-homed-hosts">
      <title>Dual Homed Hosts</title>

      <indexterm><primary>dual homed hosts</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A a dual-homed system is a host which resides on two
	different networks.</para>

      <para>The dual-homed machine might have two Ethernet cards, each
	having an address on a separate subnet.  Alternately, the
	machine can have one Ethernet card and uses &man.ifconfig.8;
	aliasing.  The former is used if two physically separate
	Ethernet networks are in use and the latter if there is one
	physical network segment, but two logically separate
	subnets.</para>

      <para>Either way, routing tables are set up so that each subnet
	knows that this machine is the defined gateway (inbound route)
	to the other subnet.  This configuration, with the machine
	acting as a router between the two subnets, is often used
	to implement packet filtering or firewall security in
	either or both directions.</para>

      <para>For this machine to forward packets between the two
	interfaces, &os; must be configured as a router, as
	demonstrated in the next section.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="network-dedicated-router">
      <title>Building a Router</title>

      <indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A network router is a system that forwards packets from
	one interface to another.  Internet standards and good
	engineering practice prevent the &os; Project from enabling
	this by default in &os;.  This feature can be enabled by
	changing the following variable to <literal>YES</literal> in
	&man.rc.conf.5;:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway</programlisting>

      <para>This option will set the &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>net.inet.ip.forwarding</varname> to
	<literal>1</literal>.  To stop routing, reset this to
	<literal>0</literal>.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>OSPF</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The new router will need routes to know where to send the
	traffic.  If the network is simple enough, static routes can
	be used.  &os; comes with the standard BSD routing daemon
	&man.routed.8;, which speaks <acronym>RIP</acronym> versions
	1 and 2, and <acronym>IRDP</acronym>.  Support for
	<acronym>BGP</acronym>v4, <acronym>OSPF</acronym>v2, and other
	sophisticated routing protocols is available with the

      <title>Wireless Networking Basics</title>

      <para>Most wireless networks are based on the &ieee; 802.11
	standards.  A basic wireless network consists of multiple
	stations communicating with radios that broadcast in either
	the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band, though this varies according to the
	locale and is also changing to enable communication in the
	2.3GHz and 4.9GHz ranges.</para>

      <para>802.11 networks are organized in two ways.  In
	<emphasis>infrastructure mode</emphasis>, one station acts as
	a
	master with all the other stations associating to it, the
	network is known as a <acronym>BSS</acronym>, and the master
	station is termed an access point (<acronym>AP</acronym>).
	In a <acronym>BSS</acronym>, all communication passes through
	the <acronym>AP</acronym>; even when one station wants to
	communicate with another wireless station, messages must go
	through the <acronym>AP</acronym>.  In the second form of
	network, there is no master and stations communicate directly.
	This form of network is termed an <acronym>IBSS</acronym>
	and is commonly known as an <emphasis>ad-hoc
	  network</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>802.11 networks were first deployed in the 2.4GHz band
	using protocols defined by the &ieee; 802.11 and 802.11b
	standard.  These specifications include the operating
	frequencies and the <acronym>MAC</acronym> layer
	characteristics, including framing and transmission rates,
	as communication can occur at various rates.  Later, the
	802.11a standard defined operation in the 5GHz band, including
	different signaling mechanisms and higher transmission rates.
	Still later, the 802.11g standard defined the use of 802.11a
	signaling and transmission mechanisms in the 2.4GHz band in
	such a way as to be backwards compatible with 802.11b
	networks.</para>

      <para>Separate from the underlying transmission techniques,
	802.11 networks have a variety of security mechanisms.  The
	original 802.11 specifications defined a simple security
	protocol called <acronym>WEP</acronym>.  This protocol uses a
	fixed pre-shared key and the RC4 cryptographic cipher to
	encode data transmitted on a network.  Stations must all
	agree on the fixed key in order to communicate.  This scheme
	was shown to be easily broken and is now rarely used except
	to discourage transient users from joining networks.  Current
	security practice is given by the &ieee; 802.11i specification
	that defines new cryptographic ciphers and an additional
	protocol to authenticate stations to an access point and
	exchange keys for data communication.  Cryptographic keys
	are periodically refreshed and there are mechanisms for
	detecting and countering intrusion attempts.  Another
	security protocol specification commonly used in wireless
	networks is termed <acronym>WPA</acronym>, which was a
	precursor to 802.11i.  <acronym>WPA</acronym> specifies a
	subset of the requirements found in 802.11i and is designed
	for implementation on legacy hardware.  Specifically,
	<acronym>WPA</acronym> requires only the
	<acronym>TKIP</acronym> cipher that is derived from the
	original <acronym>WEP</acronym> cipher.  802.11i permits use
	of <acronym>TKIP</acronym> but also requires support for a
	stronger cipher, AES-CCM, for encrypting data.  The
	<acronym>AES</acronym> cipher was not required in
	<acronym>WPA</acronym> because it was deemed too
	computationally costly to be implemented on legacy
	hardware.</para>

      <para>The other standard to be aware of is 802.11e.  It defines
	protocols for deploying multimedia applications, such as
	streaming video and voice over IP (<acronym>VoIP</acronym>),
	in an 802.11 network.  Like 802.11i, 802.11e also has a
	precursor specification termed <acronym>WME</acronym> (later
	renamed <acronym>WMM</acronym>) that has been defined by an
	industry group as a subset of 802.11e that can be deployed now
	to enable multimedia applications while waiting for the final
	ratification of 802.11e.  The most important thing to know
	about 802.11e and
	<acronym>WME</acronym>/<acronym>WMM</acronym> is that it
	enables prioritized traffic over a wireless network through
	Quality of Service (<acronym>QoS</acronym>) protocols and
	enhanced media access protocols.  Proper implementation of
	these protocols enables high speed bursting of data and
	prioritized traffic flow.</para>

      <para>&os; supports networks that operate using 802.11a,
	802.11b, and 802.11g.  The <acronym>WPA</acronym> and 802.11i
	security protocols are likewise supported (in conjunction with
	any of 11a, 11b, and 11g) and <acronym>QoS</acronym> and
	traffic prioritization required by the
	<acronym>WME</acronym>/<acronym>WMM</acronym> protocols are
	supported for a limited set of wireless devices.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Kernel Configuration</title>

	<para>To use wireless networking, a wireless networking card
	  is needed and the kernel needs to be configured with the
	  appropriate wireless networking support.  The kernel is
	  separated into multiple modules so that only the required
	  support needs to be configured.</para>

	<para>The most
	  commonly used wireless devices are those that use parts made
	  by Atheros.  These devices are supported by &man.ath.4;
	  and require the following line to be added to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>if_ath_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>The Atheros driver is split up into three separate
	  pieces: the driver (&man.ath.4;), the hardware support
	  layer that handles chip-specific functions
	  (&man.ath.hal.4;), and an algorithm for selecting the
	  rate for transmitting frames.  When this support is loaded
	  as kernel modules, any dependencies are automatically
	  handled.  To load support for a different type of wireless
	  device, specify the module for that device.  This example
	  is for devices based on the Intersil Prism parts
	  (&man.wi.4;) driver:</para>

	<programlisting>if_wi_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>The examples in this section use an &man.ath.4;
	    device and the device name in the examples must be
	    changed according to the configuration.  A list of
	    available wireless drivers and supported adapters can be
	    found in the &os; Hardware Notes, available on
	    the <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Release
	      Information</ulink> page of the &os; website.  If a
	    native &os; driver for the wireless device does not
	    exist, it may be possible to use the &windows; driver
	    with the help of the <link
	      linkend="config-network-ndis">NDIS</link> driver
	    wrapper.</para>
	</note>

	<para>In addition, the modules that implement cryptographic
	  support for the security protocols to use must be loaded.
	  These are intended to be dynamically loaded on demand by
	  the &man.wlan.4; module, but for now they must be manually
	  configured.  The following modules are available:
	  &man.wlan.wep.4;, &man.wlan.ccmp.4;, and &man.wlan.tkip.4;.
	  The &man.wlan.ccmp.4; and &man.wlan.tkip.4; drivers are
	  only needed when using the <acronym>WPA</acronym> or
	  802.11i security protocols.  If the network does not use
	  encryption, &man.wlan.wep.4; support is not needed.  To
	  load these modules at boot time, add the following lines to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>wlan_wep_load="YES"
wlan_ccmp_load="YES"
wlan_tkip_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>Once this information has been added to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, reboot the &os;
	  box.  Alternately, load the modules by hand using
	  &man.kldload.8;.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>For users who do not want to use modules, it is
	    possible to compile these drivers into the kernel by
	    adding the following lines to a custom kernel
	    configuration file:</para>

	  <programlisting>device wlan              # 802.11 support
device wlan_wep          # 802.11 WEP support
device wlan_ccmp         # 802.11 CCMP support
device wlan_tkip         # 802.11 TKIP support
device wlan_amrr         # AMRR transmit rate control algorithm
device ath               # Atheros pci/cardbus NIC's
device ath_hal           # pci/cardbus chip support
options AH_SUPPORT_AR5416 # enable AR5416 tx/rx descriptors
device ath_rate_sample   # SampleRate tx rate control for ath</programlisting>

	  <para>With this information in the kernel configuration
	    file, recompile the kernel and reboot the &os;
	    machine.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Information about the wireless device should appear
	  in the boot messages, like this:</para>

      <title>Infrastructure Mode</title>

      <para>Infrastructure (<acronym>BSS</acronym>) mode is the
	mode that is typically used.  In this mode, a number of
	wireless access points are connected to a wired network.
	Each wireless network has its own name, called the
	<acronym>SSID</acronym>.  Wireless clients connect to the
	wireless access points.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>How to Find Access Points</title>

	  <para>To scan for available networks, use &man.ifconfig.8;.
	    This request may take a few moments to complete as it
	    requires the system to switch to each available wireless
	    frequency and probe for available access points.  Only
	    the superuser can initiate a scan:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig <replaceable>wlan0</replaceable> create wlandev <replaceable>ath0</replaceable></userinput>

	    <para>The interface must be <option>up</option> before
	      it can scan.  Subsequent scan requests do not require
	      the interface to be marked as up again.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The output of a scan request lists each
	    <acronym>BSS</acronym>/<acronym>IBSS</acronym> network
	    found.  Besides listing the name of the network, the
	    <literal>SSID</literal>, the output also shows the
	    <literal>BSSID</literal>, which is the
	    <acronym>MAC</acronym> address of the access point.  The

	  <title>Basic Settings</title>

	  <para>This section provides a simple example of how to make
	    the wireless network adapter work in &os; without
	    encryption.  Once familiar with these concepts, it is
	    strongly recommend to use <link
	      linkend="network-wireless-wpa">WPA</link> to set up
	    the wireless network.</para>

	  <para>There are three basic steps to configure a wireless
	    network: select an access point, authenticate the
	    station, and configure an <acronym>IP</acronym> address.
	    The following sections discuss each step.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Selecting an Access Point</title>

	    <para>Most of the time, it is sufficient to let the system
	      choose an access point using the builtin heuristics.
	      This is the default behaviour when an interface is
	      marked as up or it is listed in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>If there are multiple access points, a specific
	      one can be selected by its
	      <acronym>SSID</acronym>:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>In an environment where there are multiple access
	      points with the same <acronym>SSID</acronym>, which
	      is often done to simplify roaming, it may be necessary
	      to associate to one specific device.  In this case, the
	      <acronym>BSSID</acronym> of the access point can be
	      specified, with or without the
	      <acronym>SSID</acronym>:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> bssid <replaceable>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>There are other ways to constrain the choice of an
	      access point, such as limiting the set of frequencies
	      the system will scan on.  This may be useful for a
	      multi-band wireless card as scanning all the possible
	      channels can be time-consuming.  To limit operation to a
	      specific band, use the <option>mode</option>
	      parameter:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="mode <replaceable>11g</replaceable> ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>This example will force the card to operate in
	      802.11g, which is defined only for 2.4GHz frequencies
	      so any 5GHz channels will not be considered.  This can
	      also be achieved with the
	      <option>channel</option> parameter, which locks
	      operation to one specific frequency, and the
	      <option>chanlist</option> parameter, to specify a list
	      of channels for scanning.  More information about these
	      parameters can be found in &man.ifconfig.8;.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Authentication</title>

	    <para>Once an access point is selected, the station
	      needs to authenticate before it can pass data.
	      Authentication can happen in several ways.  The most
	      common scheme, open authentication, allows any station
	      to join the network and communicate.  This is the
	      authentication to use for test purposes the first time
	      a wireless network is setup.  Other schemes require
	      cryptographic handshakes to be completed before data
	      traffic can flow, either using pre-shared keys or
	      secrets, or more complex schemes that involve backend
	      services such as <acronym>RADIUS</acronym>.  Open
	      authentication is the default setting.  The next most
	      common setup is <acronym>WPA-PSK</acronym>, also
	      known as <acronym>WPA</acronym> Personal, which is
	      described in <xref
		linkend="network-wireless-wpa-wpa-psk"/>.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>If using an &apple; &airport; Extreme base
		station for an access point, shared-key authentication
		together with a <acronym>WEP</acronym> key needs to
		be configured.  This can be configured in
		<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> or by using
		&man.wpa.supplicant.8;.  For a single &airport; base
		station, access can be configured with:</para>

	      <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="authmode shared wepmode on weptxkey <replaceable>1</replaceable> wepkey <replaceable>01234567</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	      <para>In general, shared key authentication should be
		avoided because it uses the <acronym>WEP</acronym> key
		material in a highly-constrained manner, making it
		even easier to crack the key.  If
		<acronym>WEP</acronym> must be used for compatibility
		with legacy devices, it is better to use
		<acronym>WEP</acronym> with <literal>open</literal>
		authentication.  More information regarding
		<acronym>WEP</acronym> can be found in <xref
		  linkend="network-wireless-wep"/>.</para>
	    </note>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Getting an <acronym>IP</acronym> Address with
	      <acronym>DHCP</acronym></title>

	    <para>Once an access point is selected and the
	      authentication parameters are set, an
	      <acronym>IP</acronym> address must be obtained in
	      order to communicate.  Most of the time, the

	  <title><acronym>WPA</acronym></title>

	  <para>Wi-Fi Protected Access (<acronym>WPA</acronym>) is a
	    security protocol used together with 802.11 networks to
	    address the lack of proper authentication and the weakness
	    of <acronym>WEP</acronym>.  WPA leverages the 802.1X
	    authentication protocol and uses one of several ciphers
	    instead of <acronym>WEP</acronym> for data integrity.
	    The only cipher required by <acronym>WPA</acronym> is the
	    Temporary Key Integrity Protocol
	    (<acronym>TKIP</acronym>).  <acronym>TKIP</acronym> is a
	    cipher that extends the basic RC4 cipher used by
	    <acronym>WEP</acronym> by adding integrity checking,
	    tamper detection, and measures for responding to detected
	    intrusions.  <acronym>TKIP</acronym> is designed to work
	    on legacy hardware with only software modification.  It
	    represents a compromise that improves security but is
	    still not entirely immune to attack.
	    <acronym>WPA</acronym> also specifies the
	    <acronym>AES-CCMP</acronym> cipher as an alternative to
	    <acronym>TKIP</acronym>, and that is preferred when
	    possible.  For this specification, the term
	    <acronym>WPA2</acronym> or <acronym>RSN</acronym> is
	    commonly used.</para>

	  <para><acronym>WPA</acronym> defines authentication and
	    encryption protocols.  Authentication is most commonly
	    done using one of two techniques: by 802.1X and a backend
	    authentication service such as <acronym>RADIUS</acronym>,
	    or by a minimal handshake between the station and the
	    access point using a pre-shared secret.  The former is
	    commonly termed <acronym>WPA</acronym> Enterprise and the
	    latter is known as <acronym>WPA</acronym> Personal.  Since
	    most people will not set up a <acronym>RADIUS</acronym>
	    backend server for their wireless network,
	    <acronym>WPA-PSK</acronym> is by far the most commonly
	    encountered configuration for
	    <acronym>WPA</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>The control of the wireless connection and the key
	    negotiation or authentication with a server is done using
	    &man.wpa.supplicant.8;.  This program requires a
	    configuration file,
	    <filename>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</filename>, to run.
	    More information regarding this file can be found in
	    &man.wpa.supplicant.conf.5;.</para>

	    <para><acronym>WPA-PSK</acronym>, also known as
	      <acronym>WPA</acronym> Personal, is based on a
	      pre-shared key (<acronym>PSK</acronym>) which is
	      generated from a given password and used as the master
	      key in the wireless network.  This means every wireless
	      user will share the same key.
	      <acronym>WPA-PSK</acronym> is intended for small
	      networks where the use of an authentication server is
	      not possible or desired.</para>

	    <warning>

	      <para><acronym>PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2</acronym> is the most

	    </note>

	    <para>Protected EAP (<acronym>PEAP</acronym>) is designed
	      as an alternative to <acronym>EAP-TTLS</acronym> and
	      is the most used <acronym>EAP</acronym> standard after
	      <acronym>EAP-TLS</acronym>.  In a network with mixed
	      operating systems, <acronym>PEAP</acronym> should be
	      the most supported standard after
	      <acronym>EAP-TLS</acronym>.</para>

	    <para><acronym>PEAP</acronym> is similar to
	      <acronym>EAP-TTLS</acronym> as it uses a server-side
	      certificate to authenticate clients by creating an
	      encrypted <acronym>TLS</acronym> tunnel between the
	      client and the authentication server, which protects
	      the ensuing exchange of authentication information.
	      <acronym>PEAP</acronym> authentication differs from
	      <acronym>EAP-TTLS</acronym> as it broadcasts the
	      username in the clear and only the password is sent
	      in the encrypted <acronym>TLS</acronym> tunnel.
	      <acronym>EAP-TTLS</acronym> will use the
	      <acronym>TLS</acronym> tunnel for both the username
	      and password.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal
	networks operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a
	range of 10 meters.  Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from
	portable devices such as cellular phones, handhelds and
	laptops.  Unlike Wi-Fi wireless technology, Bluetooth offers
	higher level service profiles, such as FTP-like file servers,
	file pushing, voice transport, serial line emulation, and
	more.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth stack in &os; is implemented using the
	&man.netgraph.4; framework.  A broad variety of Bluetooth
	<acronym>USB</acronym> dongles is supported by &man.ng.ubt.4;.
	Broadcom BCM2033 based Bluetooth devices are supported by
	the &man.ubtbcmfw.4; and &man.ng.ubt.4; drivers.  The 3Com
	Bluetooth PC Card 3CRWB60-A is supported by the
	&man.ng.bt3c.4; driver.  Serial and UART based Bluetooth
	devices are supported by &man.sio.4;, &man.ng.h4.4; and
	&man.hcseriald.8;.  This section describes the use of a
	<acronym>USB</acronym> Bluetooth dongle.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Plugging in the Device</title>

      <para>By default, Bluetooth device drivers are available as
	kernel modules.  Before attaching a device, load the driver
	into the kernel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ng_ubt</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the Bluetooth device is present in the system during
	system startup, load the module from
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>ng_ubt_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Plug in the <acronym>USB</acronym> dongle.  Output
	similar to the following will appear on the console and in
	the system log:</para>

      <screen>ubt0: vendor 0x0a12 product 0x0001, rev 1.10/5.25, addr 2

      wMaxPacketSize=49, nframes=6, buffer size=294</screen>

      <para>To start and stop the Bluetooth stack, use
	&man.service.8;.  It is a good idea to stop the stack before
	unplugging the device.  When starting the stack, the output
	should be similar to the following:</para>

      <title>Host Controller Interface
	(<acronym>HCI</acronym>)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>HCI</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Host Controller Interface (<acronym>HCI</acronym>)
	provides a command interface to the baseband controller and
	link manager as well as access to hardware status and control
	registers.  This interface provides a uniform method for
	accessing Bluetooth baseband capabilities.  The
	<acronym>HCI</acronym> layer on the host exchanges data and
	commands with the <acronym>HCI</acronym> firmware on the
	Bluetooth hardware.  The Host Controller Transport Layer
	(physical bus) driver provides both <acronym>HCI</acronym>
	layers with the ability to exchange information.</para>

      <para>A single netgraph node of type <emphasis>hci</emphasis>
	is created for a single Bluetooth device.  The
	<acronym>HCI</acronym> node is normally connected to the
	downstream Bluetooth device driver node and the upstream
	<acronym>L2CAP</acronym> node.  All <acronym>HCI</acronym>
	operations must be performed on the <acronym>HCI</acronym>
	node and not on the device driver node.  The default name
	for the <acronym>HCI</acronym> node is
	<quote>devicehci</quote>.  For more details, refer to
	&man.ng.hci.4;.</para>

      <para>One of the most common tasks is discovery of Bluetooth
	devices in <acronym>RF</acronym> proximity.  This operation is
	called <emphasis>inquiry</emphasis>.  Inquiry and other
	<acronym>HCI</acronym> related operations are done using
	&man.hccontrol.8;.  The example below shows how to find out
	which Bluetooth devices are in range.  The list of devices
	should be displayed in a few seconds.  Note that a remote
	device will only answer the inquiry if it is set to
	<emphasis>discoverable</emphasis> mode.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci inquiry</userinput>

Inquiry complete. Status: No error [00]</screen>

      <para>The <literal>BD_ADDR</literal> is the unique address of a
	Bluetooth device, similar to the <acronym>MAC</acronym>
	address of a network card.  This address is needed for
	further communication with a device.  It is possible to
	assign a human readable name to a BD_ADDR.  Information
	regarding the known Bluetooth hosts is contained in
	<filename>/etc/bluetooth/hosts</filename>.  The following
	example shows how to obtain the human readable name that
	was assigned to the remote device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci remote_name_request 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>
BD_ADDR: 00:80:37:29:19:a4
Name: Pav's T39</screen>

      <para>If an inquiry is performed on a remote Bluetooth device,
	it will find the computer as
	<quote>your.host.name (ubt0)</quote>. The name assigned to the
	local device can be changed at any time.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection
	between two Bluetooth units, or a point-to-multipoint
	connection which is shared among several Bluetooth devices.
	The following example shows how to obtain the list of active
	baseband connections for the local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci read_connection_list</userinput>
Remote BD_ADDR    Handle Type Mode Role Encrypt Pending Queue State
00:80:37:29:19:a4     41  ACL    0 MAST    NONE       0     0 OPEN</screen>

      <para>A <emphasis>connection handle</emphasis> is useful when
	termination of the baseband connection is required, though
	it is normally not required to do this by hand.  The stack
	will automatically terminate inactive baseband
	connections.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci disconnect 41</userinput>
Connection handle: 41
Reason: Connection terminated by local host [0x16]</screen>

      <para>Type <command>hccontrol help</command> for a complete

	of the <acronym>HCI</acronym> commands do not require
	superuser privileges.</para>

      <title>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol
	(<acronym>L2CAP</acronym>)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>L2CAP</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol
	(<acronym>L2CAP</acronym>) provides connection-oriented and
	connectionless data services to upper layer protocols with
	protocol multiplexing capability and segmentation and
	reassembly operation.  <acronym>L2CAP</acronym> permits
	higher level protocols and applications to transmit and
	receive <acronym>L2CAP</acronym> data packets up to 64
	kilobytes in length.</para>

      <para><acronym>L2CAP</acronym> is based around the concept of
	<emphasis>channels</emphasis>.  A channel is a logical
	connection on top of a baseband connection.  Each channel is
	bound to a single protocol in a many-to-one fashion.  Multiple
	channels can be bound to the same protocol, but a channel
	cannot be bound to multiple protocols.  Each
	<acronym>L2CAP</acronym> packet received on a channel is
	directed to the appropriate higher level protocol.  Multiple
	channels can share the same baseband connection.</para>

      <para>A single netgraph node of type <emphasis>l2cap</emphasis>
	is created for a single Bluetooth device.  The
	<acronym>L2CAP</acronym> node is normally connected to the
	downstream Bluetooth <acronym>HCI</acronym> node and upstream
	Bluetooth socket nodes.  The default name for the
	<acronym>L2CAP</acronym> node is <quote>devicel2cap</quote>.
	For more details refer to &man.ng.l2cap.4;.</para>

      <para>A useful command is &man.l2ping.8;, which can be used to
	ping other devices.  Some Bluetooth implementations might not
	return all of the data sent to them, so <literal>0
	  bytes</literal> in the following example is normal.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>l2ping -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>
0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=0 time=48.633 ms result=0

0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=3 time=46.150 ms result=0</screen>

      <para>The &man.l2control.8; utility is used to perform various
	operations on <acronym>L2CAP</acronym> nodes.  This example
	shows how to obtain the list of logical connections (channels)
	and the list of baseband connections for the local
	device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>l2control -a 00:02:72:00:d4:1a read_channel_list</userinput>

      <para>Another diagnostic tool is &man.btsockstat.1;.  It is
	similar to &man.netstat.1;, but for Bluetooth network-related
	data structures.  The example below shows the same logical

	device, such as a cellular phone, may choose to require
	authentication to provide a particular service.  Bluetooth
	authentication is normally done with a
	<emphasis><acronym>PIN</acronym> code</emphasis>, an ASCII
	string up to 16 characters in length.  The user is required
	to enter the same <acronym>PIN</acronym> code on both devices.
	Once the user has entered the <acronym>PIN</acronym> code,
	both devices will generate a <emphasis>link key</emphasis>.
	After that, the link key can be stored either in the devices
	or in a persistent storage.  Next time, both devices will
	use the previously generated link key.  This procedure is
	called <emphasis>pairing</emphasis>.  Note that if the link
	key is lost by either device, the pairing must be
	repeated.</para>

      <para>The &man.hcsecd.8; daemon is responsible for handling
	Bluetooth authentication requests.  The default configuration
	file is <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf</filename>.  An
	example section for a cellular phone with the
	<acronym>PIN</acronym> code arbitrarily set to
	<quote>1234</quote> is shown below:</para>

      <programlisting>device {
        bdaddr  00:80:37:29:19:a4;
        name    "Pav's T39";
        key     nokey;
        pin     "1234";
      }</programlisting>

      <para>The only limitation on <acronym>PIN</acronym> codes is
	length.  Some devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, may have
	a fixed <acronym>PIN</acronym> code built in.  The
	<option>-d</option> switch forces &man.hcsecd.8; to stay in
	the foreground, so it is easy to see what is happening.  Set
	the remote device to receive pairing and initiate the
	Bluetooth connection to the remote device.  The remote device
	should indicate that pairing was accepted and request the
	<acronym>PIN</acronym> code.  Enter the same
	<acronym>PIN</acronym> code listed in
	<filename>hcsecd.conf</filename>.  Now the computer and the
	remote device are paired.  Alternatively, pairing can be
	initiated on the remote device.</para>

      <para>The following line can be added to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to configure &man.hcsecd.8;
	to start automatically on system start:</para>

      <programlisting>hcsecd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>The following is a sample of the &man.hcsecd.8; daemon

      <title>Service Discovery Protocol
	(<acronym>SDP</acronym>)</title>

      <indexterm><primary>SDP</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Service Discovery Protocol (<acronym>SDP</acronym>)
	provides the means for client applications to discover the
	existence of services provided by server applications as well
	as the attributes of those services.  The attributes of a
	service include the type or class of service offered and the
	mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the
	service.</para>

      <para><acronym>SDP</acronym> involves communication between a
	<acronym>SDP</acronym> server and a <acronym>SDP</acronym>
	client.  The server maintains a list of service records that
	describe the characteristics of services associated with the
	server.  Each service record contains information about a
	single service.  A client may retrieve information from a
	service record maintained by the <acronym>SDP</acronym> server
	by issuing a <acronym>SDP</acronym> request.  If the client,
	or an application associated with the client, decides to use
	a service, it must open a separate connection to the service
	provider in order to utilize the service.
	<acronym>SDP</acronym> provides a mechanism for discovering
	services and their attributes, but it does not provide a
	mechanism for utilizing those services.</para>

      <para>Normally, a <acronym>SDP</acronym> client searches for
	services based on some desired characteristics of the
	services.  However, there are times when it is desirable to
	discover which types of services are described by an
	<acronym>SDP</acronym> server's service records without any
	prior information about the services.  This process of
	looking for any offered services is called
	<emphasis>browsing</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth <acronym>SDP</acronym> server, &man.sdpd.8;,
	and command line client, &man.sdpcontrol.8;, are included in
	the standard &os; installation.  The following example shows
	how to perform a <acronym>SDP</acronym> browse query.</para>

      <para>Note that each service has a list of attributes, such
	as the <acronym>RFCOMM</acronym> channel.  Depending on the
	service, the user might need to make note of some of the
	attributes.  Some Bluetooth implementations do not support
	service browsing and may return an empty list.  In this case,
	it is possible to search for the specific service.  The

      <para>Offering services on &os; to Bluetooth clients is done

      <para>In &os;, these profiles are implemented with &man.ppp.8;
	and the &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; wrapper which converts a

	&man.rfcomm.pppd.8; for examples.</para>

      <para>In the following example, &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; is used

      <indexterm><primary>bridge</primary></indexterm>
      <para>It is sometimes useful to divide one physical network,
	such as an Ethernet segment, into two separate network
	segments without having to create <acronym>IP</acronym>
	subnets and use a router to connect the segments together.
	A device that connects two networks together in this fashion
	is called a <quote>bridge</quote>.  A &os; system with two
	network interface cards can act as a bridge.</para>

      <para>The bridge works by learning the <acronym>MAC</acronym>
	layer (Ethernet) addresses of the devices on each of its
	network interfaces.  It forwards traffic between two networks
	only when the source and destination are on different
	networks.</para>

      <para>In many respects, a bridge is like an Ethernet switch with
	very few ports.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Situations Where Bridging Is Appropriate</title>

      <para>There are many common situations in which a bridge is used
	today.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting Networks</title>

	<para>The basic operation of a bridge is to join two or more
	  network segments together.  There are many reasons to use a
	  host based bridge over plain networking equipment such as
	  cabling constraints, firewalling, or connecting pseudo
	  networks such as a virtual machine interface.  A bridge can
	  also connect a wireless interface running in hostap mode to
	  a wired network and act as an access point.</para>

	<title>Filtering/Traffic Shaping Firewall</title>

	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>NAT</primary></indexterm>

	<para>A common situation is where firewall functionality is
	  needed without routing or Network Address Translation
	  (<acronym>NAT</acronym>).</para>

	<para>An example is a small company that is connected via
	  <acronym>DSL</acronym>
	  or <acronym>ISDN</acronym> to an <acronym>ISP</acronym>.
	  There are thirteen globally-accessible <acronym>IP</acronym>
	  addresses from the <acronym>ISP</acronym> and ten computers
	  on the network.  In this situation, using a router-based
	  firewall is difficult because of subnetting issues.</para>

	<para>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and dropped
	  into the path just downstream of the <acronym>DSL</acronym>

	<title>Network Tap</title>

	<para>A bridge can join two network segments and be used to
	  inspect all Ethernet frames that pass between them using
	  &man.bpf.4; and &man.tcpdump.1; on the bridge interface or
	  by sending a copy of all frames out an additional interface
	  known as a span port.</para>

	<title>Layer 2 <acronym>VPN</acronym></title>

	<para>Two Ethernet networks can be joined across an

	<title>Layer 2 Redundancy</title>

	<para>A network can be connected together with multiple links
	  and use the Spanning Tree Protocol <acronym>STP</acronym>
	  to block redundant paths.  For an Ethernet network to
	  function properly, only one active path can exist between
	  two devices.  <acronym>STP</acronym> will detect loops and
	  put the redundant links into a blocked state.  Should one
	  of the active links fail, <acronym>STP</acronym> will
	  calculate a different tree and enable one of the blocked
	  paths to restore connectivity to all points in the
	  network.</para>

      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

      <para>This section covers the &man.if.bridge.4; implementation.
	A netgraph bridging driver is also available, and is described
	in &man.ng.bridge.4;.</para>

      <para>In &os;, &man.if.bridge.4; is a kernel module which is
	automatically loaded by &man.ifconfig.8; when creating a
	bridge interface.  It is also possible to compile the bridge
	in to the kernel by adding <literal>device if_bridge</literal>
	to a custom kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>Packet filtering can be used with any firewall package
	that hooks in via the &man.pfil.9; framework.  The firewall
	can be loaded as a module or compiled into the kernel.</para>

      <para>The bridge can be used as a traffic shaper with
	&man.altq.4; or &man.dummynet.4;.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling the Bridge</title>

      <para>The bridge is created using interface cloning.  To create
	a bridge use &man.ifconfig.8;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge create</userinput>
bridge0
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0</userinput>
bridge0: flags=8802&lt;BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
        ether 96:3d:4b:f1:79:7a

        maxage 20 holdcnt 6 proto rstp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200
        root id 00:00:00:00:00:00 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0</screen>

      <para>When a bridge interface is created, it is automatically
	assigned a randomly generated Ethernet address.  The
	<literal>maxaddr</literal> and <literal>timeout</literal>
	parameters control how many <acronym>MAC</acronym> addresses
	the bridge will keep in its forwarding table and how many
	seconds before each entry is removed after it is last seen.
	The other parameters control how <acronym>STP</acronym>
	operates.</para>

      <para>Next, add the member network interfaces to the bridge.
	For the bridge to forward packets, all member interfaces and
	the bridge need to be up:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm fxp0 addm fxp1 up</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig fxp0 up</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig fxp1 up</userinput></screen>

      <para>The bridge is now forwarding Ethernet frames between
	<devicename>fxp0</devicename> and
	<devicename>fxp1</devicename>.  Add the following lines to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> so the bridge is created
	at startup:</para>

      <programlisting>cloned_interfaces="bridge0"
ifconfig_bridge0="addm fxp0 addm fxp1 up"

	pass through the filter inbound on the originating interface
	on the bridge interface, and outbound on the appropriate

      <title>Spanning Tree</title>

      <para>The bridge driver implements the Rapid Spanning Tree
	Protocol (<acronym>RSTP</acronym> or 802.1w) with backwards
	compatibility with legacy <acronym>STP</acronym>.
	<acronym>STP</acronym> is used to detect and remove loops
	in a network topology.  <acronym>RSTP</acronym> provides
	faster convergence than legacy <acronym>STP</acronym>, the
	protocol will exchange information with neighboring switches
	to quickly transition to forwarding without creating loops.
	&os; supports <acronym>RSTP</acronym> and
	<acronym>STP</acronym> as operating modes, with
	<acronym>RSTP</acronym> being the default mode.</para>

      <para><acronym>STP</acronym> can be enabled on member interfaces

	<title>Reconstruct Traffic Flows</title>

	<para>The bridge supports monitor mode, where the packets are
	  discarded after &man.bpf.4; processing and are not
	  processed or forwarded further.  This can be used to
	  multiplex the input of two or more interfaces into a single
	  &man.bpf.4; stream.  This is useful for reconstructing the
	  traffic for network taps that transmit the RX/TX signals out
	  through two separate interfaces.</para>

	<para>To read the input from four network interfaces as one
	  stream:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm fxp0 addm fxp1 addm fxp2 addm fxp3 monitor up</userinput>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Span Ports</title>

	<para>A copy of every Ethernet frame received by the bridge
	  will be transmitted out a designated span port.  The number
	  of span ports configured on a bridge is unlimited, but if an
	  interface is designated as a span port, it cannot also be
	  used as a regular bridge port.  This is most useful for
	  snooping a bridged network passively on another host
	  connected to one of the span ports of the bridge.</para>

	<para>To send a copy of all frames out the interface named
	  <devicename>fxp4</devicename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 span fxp4</userinput></screen>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Private Interfaces</title>

	<para>A private interface does not forward any traffic to any
	  other port that is also a private interface.  The traffic is
	  blocked unconditionally so no Ethernet frames will be
	  forwarded, including <acronym>ARP</acronym>.  If traffic
	  needs to be selectively blocked, a firewall should be used
	  instead.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Sticky Interfaces</title>

	<para>If a bridge member interface is marked as sticky,
	  dynamically learned address entries are treated at static
	  once entered into the forwarding cache.  Sticky entries are
	  never aged out of the cache or replaced, even if the address
	  is seen on a different interface.  This gives the benefit of
	  static address entries without the need to pre-populate the
	  forwarding table.  Clients learned on a particular segment
	  of the bridge can not roam to another segment.</para>

	<para>Another example of using sticky addresses is to
	  combine the bridge with <acronym>VLAN</acronym>s to create
	  a router where customer networks are isolated without
	  wasting <acronym>IP</acronym> address space.  Consider that
	  <hostid role="hostname">CustomerA</hostid> is on
	  <literal>vlan100</literal> and <hostid
	    role="hostname">CustomerB</hostid> is on
	  <literal>vlan101</literal>.  The bridge has the address
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid> and is also an
	  Internet router.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm vlan100 sticky vlan100 addm vlan101 sticky vlan101</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 inet 192.168.0.1/24</userinput></screen>

	<para>In this example, both clients see <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid> as their default
	  gateway.  Since the bridge cache is sticky, one host can not
	  spoof the <acronym>MAC</acronym> address of the other
	  customer in order to intercept their traffic.</para>

	<para>Any communication between the <acronym>VLAN</acronym>s
	  can be blocked using a firewall or, as seen in this example,
	  private interfaces:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 private vlan100 private vlan101</userinput></screen>

	<para>The customers are completely isolated from each other
	  and the full <hostid role="netmask">/24</hostid> address
	  range can be allocated without subnetting.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Address Limits</title>

	<para>The number of unique source <acronym>MAC</acronym>
	  addresses behind an interface can be limited.  Once the
	  limit is reached, packets with unknown source addresses
	  are dropped until an existing host cache entry expires or
	  is removed.</para>

	<para>The following example sets the maximum number of
	  Ethernet devices for <hostid
	    role="hostname">CustomerA</hostid> on
	  <literal>vlan100</literal> to 10:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 ifmaxaddr vlan100 10</userinput></screen>

	<title><acronym>SNMP</acronym> Monitoring</title>

	<para>The bridge interface and <acronym>STP</acronym>
	  parameters can be monitored via &man.bsnmpd.1; which is
	  included in the &os; base system.  The exported bridge
	  <acronym>MIB</acronym>s conform to the
	  <acronym>IETF</acronym> standards so any
	  <acronym>SNMP</acronym> client or monitoring package can be
	  used to retrieve the data.</para>

	<para>On the bridge, uncomment the
	  <literal>begemotSnmpdModulePath."bridge" =
	    "/usr/lib/snmp_bridge.so"</literal> line from
	  <filename>/etc/snmp.config</filename> and start
	  &man.bsnmpd.1;.  Other configuration, such as community
	  names and access lists, may need to be modified.  See
	  &man.bsnmpd.1; and &man.snmp.bridge.3; for more
	  information.</para>

	<para>The following examples use the

	<para>For laptop users, it is usually desirable to configure

    <indexterm><primary>diskless operation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>A &os; machine can boot over the network and operate
      without a local disk, using file systems mounted from an
      <acronym>NFS</acronym> server.  No system modification is
      necessary, beyond standard configuration files.  Such a system
      is relatively easy to set up because all the necessary elements
      are readily available:</para>

    <para>The &intel; Preboot eXecution Environment
      (<acronym>PXE</acronym>) can be used to load the kernel over
      the network.  It provides a form of smart boot
      <acronym>ROM</acronym> built into some networking cards or
      motherboards.  See &man.pxeboot.8; for more details.</para>

    <para>A sample script
      (<filename>/usr/share/examples/diskless/clone_root</filename>)
      eases the creation and maintenance of the workstation's root
      file system on the server.  The script will probably require
      a little customization.</para>

    <para>Standard system startup files exist in <filename
	class="directory">/etc</filename> to detect and support a
      diskless system startup.</para>

    <para>Swapping, if needed, can be done either to an
      <acronym>NFS</acronym> file or to a local disk.</para>

    <para>There are many ways to set up diskless workstations.  Many
      elements are involved, and most can be customized to suit local
      taste.  The following will describe variations on the setup of a
      complete system, emphasizing simplicity and compatibility with
      the standard &os; startup scripts.  The system described has
      the following characteristics:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The diskless workstations use a shared, read-only
	  <filename class="directory">/</filename> and
	  <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>.</para>

	<para>The root file system is a copy of a standard &os;
	  root, with some configuration files overridden by ones
	  specific to diskless operation or, possibly, to the
	  workstation they belong to.</para>

	<para>The parts of the root which have to be writable are
	  overlaid with &man.md.4; file systems.  Any changes will be
	  lost when the system reboots.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <caution>
      <para>As described, this system is insecure.  It should live in
	a protected area of a network and be untrusted by other
	hosts.</para>
    </caution>

    <sect2>
      <title>Background Information</title>

      <para>Setting up diskless workstations is both relatively
	straightforward and prone to errors.  These are sometimes
	difficult to diagnose for a number of reasons.  For
	example:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Compile time options may determine different behaviors
	    at runtime.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Error messages are often cryptic or totally
	    absent.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In this context, having some knowledge of the background
	mechanisms involved is useful to solve the problems that may
	arise.</para>

      <para>Several operations need to be performed for a successful
	bootstrap:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to obtain initial parameters such as
	    its <acronym>IP</acronym> address, executable filename,
	    server name, and root path.  This is done using the
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> or <acronym>BOOTP</acronym>
	    protocols.  <acronym>DHCP</acronym> is a compatible
	    extension of <acronym>BOOTP</acronym>, and uses the same
	    port numbers and basic packet format.  It is possible to
	    configure a system to use only <acronym>BOOTP</acronym>
	    and &man.bootpd.8; is included in the base &os;
	    system.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><acronym>DHCP</acronym> has a number of advantages
	    over <acronym>BOOTP</acronym> such as nicer configuration

	    configuration, with equivalent examples using
	    &man.bootpd.8; when possible.  The sample configuration
	    uses <application>ISC DHCP</application> which is
	    available in the Ports Collection.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to transfer one or several programs
	    to local memory.  Either <acronym>TFTP</acronym> or
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> are used.  The choice between
	    <acronym>TFTP</acronym> and <acronym>NFS</acronym> is a
	    compile time option in several places.  A common source of
	    error is to specify filenames for the wrong protocol.
	    <acronym>TFTP</acronym> typically transfers all files from
	    a single directory on the server and expects filenames
	    relative to this directory.  <acronym>NFS</acronym> needs
	    absolute file paths.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The possible intermediate bootstrap programs and the

	    <acronym>PXE</acronym> loads &man.pxeboot.8;, which is
	    a modified version of the &os; third stage loader,
	    &man.loader.8;.  The third stage loader will obtain most
	    parameters necessary to system startup and leave them
	    in the kernel environment before transferring control.
	    It is possible to use a <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	    kernel in this case.</para>

    <title>PXE Booting with an <acronym>NFS</acronym> Root File
      System</title>

    <para>The &intel; Preboot eXecution Environment
      (<acronym>PXE</acronym>) allows booting the operating system
      over the network.  <acronym>PXE</acronym> support is usually
      provided in the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> where it can be enabled
      in the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> settings which enable booting
      from the network.  A fully functioning
      <acronym>PXE</acronym> setup also requires properly configured
      <acronym>DHCP</acronym> and <acronym>TFTP</acronym>
      servers.</para>

    <para>When the host computer boots, it receives information over
      <acronym>DHCP</acronym> about where to obtain the initial boot
      loader via <acronym>TFTP</acronym>.  After the host computer
      receives this information, it downloads the boot loader via
      <acronym>TFTP</acronym> and then executes the boot loader.
      This is documented in section 2.2.1 of the <ulink
	url="http://download.intel.com/design/archives/wfm/downloads/pxespec.pdf">Preboot
	Execution Environment (<acronym>PXE</acronym>)
	Specification</ulink>.  In &os;, the boot loader retrieved
      during the <acronym>PXE</acronym> process is
      <filename>/boot/pxeboot</filename>.  After
      <filename>/boot/pxeboot</filename> executes, the &os; kernel is
      loaded and the rest of the &os; bootup sequence proceeds.
      Refer to <xref linkend="boot"/> for more information about the
      &os; booting process.</para>

    <sect2 id="network-natdport-redirection">
      <title>Port Redirection</title>

      <para>The drawback with &man.natd.8; is that the
	<acronym>LAN</acronym> clients are not accessible from the
	Internet.  Clients on the <acronym>LAN</acronym> can make
	outgoing connections to the world but cannot receive incoming
	ones.  This presents a problem if trying to run Internet
	services on one of the <acronym>LAN</acronym> client machines.
	A simple way around this is to redirect selected Internet
	ports on the &man.natd.8; machine to a <acronym>LAN</acronym>
	client.</para>

      <para>For example, an <acronym>IRC</acronym> server runs on
	client <hostid>A</hostid> and a web server runs on client
	<hostid>B</hostid>.  For this to work properly, connections
	received on ports 6667 (<acronym>IRC</acronym>) and 80
	(<acronym>HTTP</acronym>) must be redirected to the
	respective machines.</para>

      <para>The syntax for <option>-redirect_port</option> is as
	follows:</para>

      <programlisting>     -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                 [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                 [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]</programlisting>

      <para>In the above example, the argument should be:</para>

      <programlisting>    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

      <para>This redirects the proper <acronym>TCP</acronym> ports
	to the <acronym>LAN</acronym> client machines.</para>

      <para>Port ranges over individual ports can be indicated with
	<option>-redirect_port</option>.  For example,
	<replaceable>tcp 192.168.0.2:2000-3000 2000-3000</replaceable>
	would redirect all connections received on ports 2000 to 3000
	to ports 2000 to 3000 on client <hostid>A</hostid>.</para>

      <para>These options can be used when directly running
	&man.natd.8;, placed within the
	<literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, or passed via a

      <para>Address redirection is useful if more than one

	incoming on that particular <acronym>IP</acronym> address
	back to the specific <acronym>LAN</acronym> client.  This is
	also known as static <acronym>NAT</acronym>.  For example,

      <title>Background on <acronym>IPv6</acronym> Addresses</title>

      <para>There are different types of <acronym>IPv6</acronym>
	addresses: unicast, anycast, and multicast.</para>

      <para>Unicast addresses are the well known addresses.  A packet
	sent to a unicast address arrives at the interface
	belonging to the address.</para>

      <para>Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from
	unicast addresses but they address a group of interfaces.  The
	packet destined for an anycast address will arrive at the
	nearest (in router metric) interface.  Anycast addresses may
	only be used by routers.</para>

      <para>Multicast addresses identify a group of interfaces.  A
	packet destined for a multicast address will arrive at all
	interfaces belonging to the multicast group.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The <acronym>IPv4</acronym> broadcast address, usually
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">xxx.xxx.xxx.255</hostid>, is expressed
	  by multicast addresses in <acronym>IPv6</acronym>.</para>

      <title>Reading <acronym>IPv6</acronym> Addresses</title>

      <para>The canonical form is represented as:
	<hostid role="ip6addr">x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x</hostid>, with each
	<quote>x</quote> being a 16 bit hex value.  For example:
	<hostid
	  role="ip6addr">FEBC:A574:382B:23C1:AA49:4592:4EFE:9982</hostid>.</para>

      <para>Often an address will have long substrings of all zeros.
	One such substring per address can be abbreviated by
	<quote>::</quote>.  Also, up to three leading
	<quote>0</quote>s per hex quad can be omitted.  For example,
	<hostid role="ip6addr">fe80::1</hostid> corresponds to the
	canonical form <hostid
	  role="ip6addr">fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</hostid>.</para>

      <para>A third form is to write the last 32 bit part in the
	well known (decimal) <acronym>IPv4</acronym> style with dots
	(<quote>.</quote>) as separators.  For example, <hostid

    <title>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (<acronym>ATM</acronym>)</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring Classical <acronym>IP</acronym> over
	<acronym>ATM</acronym></title>

      <para>Classical <acronym>IP</acronym> over
	<acronym>ATM</acronym> (<acronym>CLIP</acronym>) is the
	simplest method to use Asynchronous Transfer Mode
	(<acronym>ATM</acronym>) with <acronym>IP</acronym>.  It can
	be used with Switched Virtual Circuits
	(<acronym>SVC</acronym>s) and with Permanent Virtual Circuits
	(<acronym>PVC</acronym>s).  This section describes how to
	set up a network based on <acronym>PVC</acronym>s.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Fully Meshed Configurations</title>

	<para>The first method to set up a <acronym>CLIP</acronym>
	  with <acronym>PVC</acronym>s is to connect each machine
	  to each other machine in the network via a dedicated
	  <acronym>PVC</acronym>.  While this is simple to
	  configure, it becomes impractical for a large number of
	  machines.  The following example supposes four machines in
	  the network, each connected to the <acronym
	    role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> network
	  with an <acronym
	    role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> adapter
	  card.  The first step is the planning of the
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses and the <acronym
	    role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym>
	  connections between the machines.  This example uses the
	  following:</para>

    <para>The <acronym>CARP</acronym> devices themselves may be
      created using &man.ifconfig.8;:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig carp0 create</userinput></screen>

    <para>In a real environment, each interface has a unique
      identification number known as a Virtual Host IDentification
      (<acronym>VHID</acronym>) which is used to distinguish the
      host on the network.</para>

      <title>Using <acronym>CARP</acronym> for Server
	Availability</title>

      <para>One use of <acronym>CARP</acronym> is to provide server
	availability.  This example configures failover support for
	three hosts, all with unique <acronym>IP</acronym>
	addresses and providing the same web content.  These machines
	act in conjunction with a Round Robin
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> configuration.  The failover machine
	has two additional <acronym>CARP</acronym> interfaces, one
	for each of the content server's
	<acronym>IP</acronym> addresses.  When a
	failure occurs, the failover server will pick up the failed
	machine's <acronym>IP</acronym> address.
	This means that the failure should go completely unnoticed
	by the user.  The failover server requires identical content
	and services as the other content servers it is expected to
	pick up load for.</para>

      <para>The two machines should be configured identically other
	than their hostnames and <acronym>VHID</acronym>s.  This
	example calls these machines
	<hostid>hosta.example.org</hostid> and
	<hostid>hostb.example.org</hostid> respectively.  First, the
	required lines for a <acronym>CARP</acronym> configuration
	have to be added to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Here
	are the lines for
	<hostid>hosta.example.org</hostid>:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="hosta.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 1 pass testpass 192.168.1.50/24"</programlisting>

      <para>On <hostid>hostb.example.org</hostid>, use the following
	lines:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="hostb.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.4 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 2 pass testpass 192.168.1.51/24"</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>It is very important that the passwords, specified by
	  the <option>pass</option> option to &man.ifconfig.8;, are
	  identical.  The <devicename>carp</devicename> devices will
	  only listen to and accept advertisements from machines
	  with the correct password.  The <acronym>VHID</acronym>
	  must also be unique for each machine.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The third machine, <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid>,
	should be prepared so that it may handle failover from either
	host.  This machine will require two
	<devicename>carp</devicename> devices, one to handle each
	host.  The appropriate <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	configuration lines will be similar to the following:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="provider.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0 carp1"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 1 advskew 100 pass testpass 192.168.1.50/24"
ifconfig_carp1="vhid 2 advskew 100 pass testpass 192.168.1.51/24"</programlisting>

      <para>Having the two <devicename>carp</devicename> devices will
	allow <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid> to notice and pick
	up the <acronym>IP</acronym> address of either machine, should
	it stop responding.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The default &os; kernel <emphasis>may</emphasis> have
	  preemption enabled.  If so,
	  <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid> may not relinquish the
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address back to the original content
	  server.  In this case, an administrator may have to manually
	  force the <acronym>IP</acronym> back to the master.  The
	  following command should be issued on
	  <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig carp0 down &amp;&amp; ifconfig carp0 up</userinput></screen>

	<para>This should be done on the <devicename>carp</devicename>
	  interface which corresponds to the correct host.</para>
      </note>

      <para>At this point, <acronym>CARP</acronym> should be enabled
	and available for testing.  For testing, either networking
	has to be restarted or the machines rebooted.</para>

      <para>More information is available in &man.carp.4;.</para>

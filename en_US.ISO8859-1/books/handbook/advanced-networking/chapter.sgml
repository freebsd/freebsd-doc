    <title>Gateways and Routes</title>

    <indexterm><primary>routing</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>gateway</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>
    <para>For one machine to be able to find another over a network,
      there must be a mechanism in place to describe how to get from
      one to the other.  This is called
      <firstterm>routing</firstterm>.  A <quote>route</quote> is a
      defined pair of addresses: a <quote>destination</quote> and a
      <quote>gateway</quote>.  The pair indicates that if you are
      trying to get to this <emphasis>destination</emphasis>,
      communicate through this <emphasis>gateway</emphasis>.  There
      are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, and
      <quote>default</quote>.  The <quote>default route</quote> is
      used if none of the other routes apply.  We will talk a little
      bit more about default routes later on.  There are also three
      types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces (also called
      <quote>links</quote>), and Ethernet hardware addresses (MAC
      addresses).
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>An Example</title>

      <para>To illustrate different aspects of routing, we will use the
	following example from <command>netstat</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>netstat -r</userinput>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The first two lines specify the default route (which we
	will cover in the <link linkend="network-routing-default">next
	  section</link>) and the <hostid>localhost</hostid> route.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>loopback device</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The interface (<literal>Netif</literal> column) that this
	routing table specifies to use for
	<literal>localhost</literal> is <devicename>lo0</devicename>,
	also known as the loopback device.  This says to keep all
	traffic for this destination internal, rather than sending it
	out over the LAN, since it will only end up back where it
	started.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Ethernet</primary>
        <secondary>MAC address</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The next thing that stands out are the addresses beginning
	with <hostid role="mac">0:e0:</hostid>.  These are Ethernet
	hardware addresses, which are also known as MAC addresses.
	FreeBSD will automatically identify any hosts
	(<hostid>test0</hostid> in the example) on the local Ethernet
	and add a route for that host, directly to it over the
	Ethernet interface, <devicename>ed0</devicename>.  There is
	also a timeout (<literal>Expire</literal> column) associated
	with this type of route, which is used if we fail to hear from
	the host in a specific amount of time.  When this happens, the
	route to this host will be automatically deleted.  These hosts
	are identified using a mechanism known as RIP (Routing
	Information Protocol), which figures out routes to local hosts
	based upon a shortest path determination.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>subnet</primary></indexterm>
      <para>FreeBSD will also add subnet routes for the local subnet (<hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.20.30.255</hostid> is the broadcast address for the
	subnet <hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid>, and <hostid
	  role="domainname">example.com</hostid> is the domain name associated
	with that subnet).  The designation <literal>link#1</literal> refers
	to the first Ethernet card in the machine.  You will notice no
	additional interface is specified for those.</para>

      <para>Both of these groups (local network hosts and local subnets) have
	their routes automatically configured by a daemon called
	<application>routed</application>.  If this is not run, then only
	routes which are statically defined (i.e. entered explicitly) will
	exist.</para>

      <para>The <literal>host1</literal> line refers to our host, which it
	knows by Ethernet address.  Since we are the sending host, FreeBSD
	knows to use the loopback interface (<devicename>lo0</devicename>)
	rather than sending it out over the Ethernet interface.</para>

      <para>The two <literal>host2</literal> lines are an example of
	what happens when we use an &man.ifconfig.8; alias (see the
	section on Ethernet for reasons why we would do this).  The
	<literal>=&gt;</literal> symbol after the
	<devicename>lo0</devicename> interface says that not only are
	we using the loopback (since this address also refers to the
	local host), but specifically it is an alias.  Such routes
	only show up on the host that supports the alias; all other
	hosts on the local network will simply have a
	<literal>link#1</literal> line for such routes.</para>

      <para>The final line (destination subnet <hostid role="ipaddr">224</hostid>) deals
	with multicasting, which will be covered in another section.</para>

      <para>Finally, various attributes of each route can be seen in
	the <literal>Flags</literal> column.  Below is a short table
	of some of these flags and their meanings:</para>

    <sect2 id="network-routing-default">
      <title>Default Routes</title>

      <indexterm><primary>default route</primary></indexterm>
      <para>When the local system needs to make a connection to a remote host,
	it checks the routing table to determine if a known path exists.  If
	the remote host falls into a subnet that we know how to reach (Cloned
	routes), then the system checks to see if it can connect along that
	interface.</para>

      <para>If all known paths fail, the system has one last option: the
	<quote>default</quote> route.  This route is a special type of gateway
	route (usually the only one present in the system), and is always
	marked with a <literal>c</literal> in the flags field.  For hosts on a
	local area network, this gateway is set to whatever machine has a
	direct connection to the outside world (whether via PPP link,
	DSL, cable modem, T1, or another network interface).</para>

      <para>If you are configuring the default route for a machine which
	itself is functioning as the gateway to the outside world, then the
	default route will be the gateway machine at your Internet Service
	Provider's (ISP) site.</para>

      <para>Let us look at an example of default routes.  This is a common
	configuration:</para>

      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata fileref="advanced-networking/net-routing">
	</imageobject>

	<textobject>
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">
[Local2]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [Local1]  &lt;--PPP--&gt; [ISP-Serv]  &lt;--ether--&gt;  [T1-GW]
      </literallayout>
	</textobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The hosts <hostid>Local1</hostid> and
	<hostid>Local2</hostid> are at your site.
	<hostid>Local1</hostid> is connected to an ISP via a dial up
	PPP connection.  This PPP server computer is connected through
	a local area network to another gateway computer through an
	external interface to the ISPs Internet feed.</para>

      <para>The default routes for each of your machines will be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="3">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Gateway</entry>
	      <entry>Interface</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>

	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2</entry>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>Ethernet</entry>
	    </row>

	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW</entry>
	      <entry>PPP</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>A common question is <quote>Why (or how) would we set
	the <hostid>T1-GW</hostid> to be the default gateway for
	<hostid>Local1</hostid>, rather than the ISP server it is
	connected to?</quote>.</para>

      <para>Remember, since the PPP interface is using an address on the ISP's
	local network for your side of the connection, routes for any other
	machines on the ISP's local network will be automatically generated.
	Hence, you will already know how to reach the <hostid>T1-GW</hostid>
	machine, so there is no need for the intermediate step
	of sending traffic to the ISP server.</para>

      <para>It is common to use the address <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">X.X.X.1</hostid> as the gateway address for your local
	network.  So (using the same example), if your local class-C address
	space was <hostid role="ipaddr">10.20.30</hostid> and your ISP was
	using <hostid role="ipaddr">10.9.9</hostid> then the default routes
	would be:</para>

      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">
	<tgroup cols="2">
	  <thead>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Host</entry>
	      <entry>Default Route</entry>
	    </row>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local2 (10.20.30.2)</entry>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	    <row>
	      <entry>Local1 (10.20.30.1, 10.9.9.30)</entry>
	      <entry>T1-GW (10.9.9.1)</entry>
	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </informaltable>

      <para>You can easily define the default route via the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.  In our example, on the
	<hostid>Local2</hostid> machine, we added the following line
	in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>defaultrouter="10.20.30.1"</programlisting>

      <para>It is also possible to do it directly from the command
	line with the &man.route.8; command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add default 10.20.30.1</userinput></screen>

      <para>For more information on manual manipulation of network
	routing tables, consult &man.route.8; manual page.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="network-dual-homed-hosts">
      <title>Dual Homed Hosts</title>

      <indexterm><primary>dual homed hosts</primary></indexterm>
      <para>There is one other type of configuration that we should cover, and
	that is a host that sits on two different networks.  Technically, any
	machine functioning as a gateway (in the example above, using a PPP
	connection) counts as a dual-homed host.  But the term is really only
	used to refer to a machine that sits on two local-area
	networks.</para>

      <para>In one case, the machine has two Ethernet cards, each
	having an address on the separate subnets.  Alternately, the
	machine may only have one Ethernet card, and be using
	&man.ifconfig.8; aliasing.  The former is used if two
	physically separate Ethernet networks are in use, the latter
	if there is one physical network segment, but two logically
	separate subnets.</para>

      <para>Either way, routing tables are set up so that each subnet knows
	that this machine is the defined gateway (inbound route) to the other
	subnet.  This configuration, with the machine acting as a router
	between the two subnets, is often used when we need to implement
	packet filtering or firewall security in either or both
	directions.</para>

      <para>If you want this machine to actually forward packets
        between the two interfaces, you need to tell FreeBSD to enable
        this ability.  See the next section for more details on how
	to do this.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="network-dedicated-router">
      <title>Building a Router</title>

      <indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A network router is simply a system that forwards packets
	from one interface to another.  Internet standards and good
	engineering practice prevent the FreeBSD Project from enabling
	this by default in FreeBSD.  You can enable this feature by
	changing the following variable to <literal>YES</literal> in
	&man.rc.conf.5;:</para>

      <programlisting>gateway_enable="YES"          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway</programlisting>

      <para>This option will set the &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>net.inet.ip.forwarding</varname> to
	<literal>1</literal>.  If you should need to stop routing
	temporarily, you can reset this to <literal>0</literal> temporarily.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>BGP</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>RIP</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>OSPF</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Your new router will need routes to know where to send the
	traffic.  If your network is simple enough you can use static
	routes.  FreeBSD also comes with the standard BSD routing
	daemon &man.routed.8;, which speaks RIP (both version 1 and
	version 2) and IRDP.  Support for BGP v4, OSPF v2, and other
	sophisticated routing protocols is available with the
	<filename role="package">net/zebra</filename> package.
	Commercial products such as <application>&gated;</application> are also available for more
	complex network routing solutions.</para>

	<para>In this scenario, <hostid>RouterA</hostid> is our &os;
	  machine that is acting as a router to the rest of the
	  Internet.  It has a default route set to <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid> which allows it to connect
	  with the outside world.  We will assume that
	  <hostid>RouterB</hostid> is already configured properly and
	  knows how to get wherever it needs to go.  (This is simple
	  in this picture.  Just add a default route on
	  <hostid>RouterB</hostid> using <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.1</hostid> as the gateway.)</para>

	<para>If we look at the routing table for

	<para>With the current routing table  <hostid>RouterA</hostid>
	  will not be able to reach our Internal Net 2.  It does not
	  have a route for <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.2.0/24</hostid>.  One way to alleviate
	  this is to manually add the route.  The following command
	  would add the Internal Net 2 network to
	  <hostid>RouterA</hostid>'s routing table using <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.2</hostid> as the next hop:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2</userinput></screen>

	<para>Now <hostid>RouterA</hostid> can reach any hosts on the

	  network.</para>

	<title>Persistent Configuration</title>

	<para>The above example is perfect for configuring a static
	  route on a running system.  However, one problem is that the
	  routing information will not persist if you reboot your &os;
	  machine.  The way to handle the addition of a static route
	  is to put it in your <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	  file:</para>

	<programlisting># Add Internal Net 2 as a static route
static_routes="internalnet2"
route_internalnet2="-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</programlisting>

	<para>The <literal>static_routes</literal> configuration
	  variable is a list of strings separated by a space.  Each
	  string references to a route name.  In our above example we
	  only have one string in <literal>static_routes</literal>.
	  This string is <replaceable>internalnet2</replaceable>.  We
	  then add a configuration variable called
	  <literal>route_<replaceable>internalnet2</replaceable></literal>
	  where we put all of the configuration parameters we would
	  give to the &man.route.8; command.  For our example above we
	  would have used the command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2</userinput></screen>

	  <para>so we need <literal>"-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"</literal>.</para>

	<para>As said above, we can have more than one string in
	  <literal>static_routes</literal>.  This allows us to
	  create multiple static routes.  The following lines shows
	  an example of adding static routes for the <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.0.0/24</hostid> and <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.1.0/24</hostid> networks on an imaginary
	  router:</para>

        <programlisting>static_routes="net1 net2"
route_net1="-net 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.0.1"
route_net2="-net 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.1"</programlisting>

    <sect2>
      <title>Wireless Networking Basics</title>

      <para>Most wireless networks are based on the &ieee; 802.11
	standards.  A basic wireless network consists of multiple
	stations communicating with radios that broadcast in either
	the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band (though this varies according to the
	locale and is also changing to enable communication in the
	2.3GHz and 4.9GHz ranges).</para>

      <para>802.11 networks are organized in two ways: in
	<emphasis>infrastructure mode</emphasis> one station acts as a
	master with all the other stations associating to it; the
	network is known as a BSS and the master station is termed an
	access point (AP).  In a BSS all communication passes through
	the AP; even when one station wants to communicate with
	another wireless station messages must go through the AP.  In
	the second form of network there is no master and stations
	communicate directly.  This form of network is termed an IBSS
	and is commonly known as an <emphasis>ad-hoc
	network</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>802.11 networks were first deployed in the 2.4GHz band
	using protocols defined by the &ieee; 802.11 and 802.11b
	standard.  These specifications include the operating
	frequencies, MAC layer characteristics including framing and
	transmission rates (communication can be done at various
	rates).  Later the 802.11a standard defined operation in the
	5GHz band, including different signalling mechanisms and
	higher transmission rates.  Still later the 802.11g standard
	was defined to enable use of 802.11a signalling and
	transmission mechanisms in the 2.4GHz band in such a way as to
	be backwards compatible with 802.11b networks.</para>

      <para>Separate from the underlying transmission techniques
	802.11 networks have a variety of security mechanisms.  The
	original 802.11 specifications defined a simple security
	protocol called WEP. This protocol uses a fixed pre-shared key
	and the RC4 cryptographic cipher to encode data transmitted on
	a network.  Stations must all agree on the fixed key in order
	to communicate.  This scheme was shown to be easily broken and
	is now rarely used except to discourage transient users from
	joining networks.  Current security practice is given by the
	&ieee; 802.11i specification that defines new cryptographic
	ciphers and an additional protocol to authenticate stations to
	an access point and exchange keys for doing data
	communication.  Further, cryptographic keys are periodically
	refreshed and there are mechanisms for detecting intrusion
	attempts (and for countering intrusion attempts).  Another
	security protocol specification commonly used in wireless
	networks is termed WPA.  This was a precursor to 802.11i
	defined by an industry group as an interim measure while
	waiting for 802.11i to be ratified.  WPA specifies a subset of
	the requirements found in 802.11i and is designed for
	implementation on legacy hardware.  Specifically WPA requires
	only the TKIP cipher that is derived from the original WEP
	cipher.  802.11i permits use of TKIP but also requires support
	for a stronger cipher, AES-CCM, for encrypting data.  (The AES
	cipher was not required in WPA because it was deemed too
	computationally costly to be implemented on legacy
	hardware.)</para>

      <para>Other than the above protocol standards the other
	important standard to be aware of is 802.11e.  This defines
	protocols for deploying multi-media applications such as
	streaming video and voice over IP (VoIP) in an 802.11 network.
	Like 802.11i, 802.11e also has a precursor specification
	termed WME (later renamed WMM) that has been defined by an
	industry group as a subset of 802.11e that can be deployed now
	to enable multi-media applications while waiting for the final
	ratification of 802.11e.  The most important thing to know
	about 802.11e and WME/WMM is that it enables prioritized
	traffic use of a wireless network through Quality of Service
	(QoS) protocols and enhanced media access protocols.  Proper
	implementation of these protocols enable high speed bursting
	of data and prioritized traffic flow.</para>

      <para>&os; supports networks that operate
	using 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.  The WPA and 802.11i
	security protocols are likewise supported (in conjunction with
	any of 11a, 11b, and 11g) and QoS and traffic prioritization
	required by the WME/WMM protocols are supported for a limited
	set of wireless devices.</para>

	<title>Kernel Configuration</title>

	<para>To use wireless networking, you need a wireless
	  networking card and to configure the kernel with the
	  appropriate wireless networking support.  The latter is
	  separated into multiple modules so that you only need to
	  configure the software you are actually going to use.</para>

	<para>The first thing you need is a wireless device.  The most
	  commonly used devices are those that use parts made by
	  Atheros.  These devices are supported by the &man.ath.4;
	  driver and require the following line to be added to the
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file:</para>

	<programlisting>if_ath_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>The Atheros driver is split up into three separate
	  pieces: the proper driver (&man.ath.4;), the hardware
	  support layer that handles chip-specific functions
	  (&man.ath.hal.4;), and an algorithm for selecting which of
	  several possible rates for transmitting frames
	  (ath_rate_sample here).  When this support is loaded as kernel
	  modules, these dependencies are automatically handled for
	  you.  If, instead of an Atheros device, you had another device
	  you would select the module for that device; e.g.:</para>

	<programlisting>if_wi_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>for devices based on the Intersil Prism parts
	  (&man.wi.4; driver).</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In the rest of this document, we will use an
	    &man.ath.4; device, the device name in the examples must
	    be changed according to your configuration.  A list of
	    available wireless drivers and supported adapters can be
	    found in the &os; Hardware Notes.  Copies of these notes
	    for various releases and architectures are available on
	    the <ulink
	    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Release
	    Information</ulink> page of the &os; Web site.
	    If a native &os; driver
	    for your wireless device does not exist, it may be
	    possible to directly use the &windows; driver with the
	    help of the <link
	    linkend="config-network-ndis">NDIS</link> driver
	    wrapper.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Under &os;&nbsp;7.X, with a device driver you need to also bring
	  in the 802.11 networking support required by the driver.
	  For the &man.ath.4; driver these are at least the &man.wlan.4;,
	  <literal>wlan_scan_ap</literal> and
	  <literal>wlan_scan_sta</literal>
	  modules; the &man.wlan.4; module is automatically loaded with the
	  wireless device driver, the remaining modules must be loaded
	  at boot time via the <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>
	  file:</para>

	<programlisting>wlan_scan_ap_load="YES"
wlan_scan_sta_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>Since &os;&nbsp;8.0, these modules are part of the
	  base &man.wlan.4; driver which is dynamically loaded with
	  the adapter driver.</para>

	<para>With that, you will need the modules
	  that implement cryptographic support for the security
	  protocols you intend to use.  These are intended to be
	  dynamically loaded on demand by the &man.wlan.4; module but
	  for now they must be manually configured.  The following
	  modules are available: &man.wlan.wep.4;, &man.wlan.ccmp.4;
	  and &man.wlan.tkip.4;.  Both &man.wlan.ccmp.4; and
	  &man.wlan.tkip.4; drivers are only needed if you intend to
	  use the WPA and/or 802.11i security protocols.  If your
	  network does not use encryption,
	  you will not need &man.wlan.wep.4; support.  To
	  load these modules at boot time, add the following lines to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>wlan_wep_load="YES"
wlan_ccmp_load="YES"
wlan_tkip_load="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>With this information in the system bootstrap
	  configuration file (i.e.,
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>), you have to reboot
	  your &os; box.  If you do not want to reboot your machine
	  for the moment, you can load the modules by hand using
	  &man.kldload.8;.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>If you do not want to use modules, it is possible to
	    compile these drivers into the kernel by adding the
	    following lines to your kernel configuration file:</para>

	  <programlisting>device wlan              # 802.11 support
device wlan_wep          # 802.11 WEP support
device wlan_ccmp         # 802.11 CCMP support
device wlan_tkip         # 802.11 TKIP support

device ath_hal           # pci/cardbus chip support
options AH_SUPPORT_AR5416 # enable AR5416 tx/rx descriptors
device ath_rate_sample   # SampleRate tx rate control for ath</programlisting>

	  <para>Both following lines are also required by
	    &os;&nbsp;7.X, other &os; versions do not need
	    them:</para>

	  <programlisting>device wlan_scan_ap      # 802.11 AP mode scanning
device wlan_scan_sta     # 802.11 STA mode scanning</programlisting>

	  <para>With this information in the kernel configuration
	    file, recompile the kernel and reboot your &os;
	    machine.</para>
	</note>

	<para>When the system is up, we could find some information
	  about the wireless device in the boot messages, like
	  this:</para>

      <title>Infrastructure Mode</title>

      <para>The infrastructure mode or BSS mode is the mode that is
	typically used.  In this mode, a number of wireless access
	points are connected to a wired network.  Each wireless
	network has its own name, this name is called the SSID of the
	network.  Wireless clients connect to the wireless access
	points.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>How to Find Access Points</title>

	  <para>To scan for networks, use the
	    <command>ifconfig</command> command.  This request may
	    take a few moments to complete as it requires that the
	    system switches to each available wireless frequency and
	    probes for available access points.  Only the super-user
	    can initiate such a scan:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig <replaceable>wlan0</replaceable> create wlandev <replaceable>ath0</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig <replaceable>wlan0</replaceable> up scan</userinput>

	  <note>
	    <para>You must mark the interface <option>up</option>
	      before you can scan.  Subsequent scan requests do not
	      require you to mark the interface up again.</para>
	  </note>

	  <note>
	    <para>Under &os;&nbsp;7.X, the adapter device, for example
	      <devicename><replaceable>ath0</replaceable></devicename>,
	      is used directly instead of the
	      <devicename>wlan<replaceable>0</replaceable></devicename>
	      device.  This requires you to replace the both previous
	      lines with:</para>

	    <para>In the rest of this document, &os;&nbsp;7.X users

	  <title>Basic Settings</title>

	  <para>This section provides a simple example of how to make
	    the wireless network adapter work in &os; without
	    encryption.  After you are familiar with these concepts,
	    we strongly recommend using <link
	    linkend="network-wireless-wpa">WPA</link> to set up your
	    wireless network.</para>

	  <para>There are three basic steps to configure a wireless
	    network: selecting an access point, authenticating your
	    station, and configuring an IP address.  The following
	    sections discuss each step.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Selecting an Access Point</title>

	    <para>Most of time it is sufficient to let the system
	      choose an access point using the builtin heuristics.
	      This is the default behaviour when you mark an interface
	      up or otherwise configure an interface by listing it in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, e.g.:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <note>
	      <para>As previously mentioned, &os;&nbsp;7.X will only
		require a line related to the adapter device:</para>

	      <programlisting>ifconfig_ath0="DHCP"</programlisting>
	    </note>

	    <para>If there are multiple access points and you want to
	      select a specific one, you can select it by its
	      SSID:</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>In an environment where there are multiple access
	      points with the same SSID (often done to simplify
	      roaming) it may be necessary to associate to one
	      specific device.  In this case you can also specify the
	      BSSID of the access point (you can also leave off the
	      SSID):</para>

	    <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="ssid <replaceable>your_ssid_here</replaceable> bssid <replaceable>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	    <para>There are other ways to constrain the choice of an
	      access point such as limiting the set of frequencies the
	      system will scan on.  This may be useful if you have a
	      multi-band wireless card as scanning all the possible
	      channels can be time-consuming.  To limit operation to a
	      specific band you can use the <option>mode</option>

	    <title>Authentication</title>

	    <para>Once you have selected an access point your station
	      needs to authenticate before it can pass data.
	      Authentication can happen in several ways.  The most
	      common scheme used is termed open authentication and
	      allows any station to join the network and communicate.
	      This is the authentication you should use for test
	      purpose the first time you set up a wireless network.
	      Other schemes require cryptographic handshakes be
	      completed before data traffic can flow; either using
	      pre-shared keys or secrets, or more complex schemes that
	      involve backend services such as RADIUS.  Most users
	      will use open authentication which is the default
	      setting.  Next most common setup is WPA-PSK, also known
	      as WPA Personal, which is described <link
	      linkend="network-wireless-wpa-wpa-psk">below</link>.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>If you have an &apple; &airport; Extreme base
		station for an access point you may need to configure
		shared-key authentication together with a WEP key.
		This can be done in the
		<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file or using the
		&man.wpa.supplicant.8; program.  If you have a single
		&airport; base station you can setup access with
		something like:</para>

	      <programlisting>wlans_ath0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="authmode shared wepmode on weptxkey <replaceable>1</replaceable> wepkey <replaceable>01234567</replaceable> DHCP"</programlisting>

	      <para>In general shared key authentication is to be
		avoided because it uses the WEP key material in a
		highly-constrained manner making it even easier to
		crack the key.  If WEP must be used (e.g., for
		compatibility with legacy devices) it is better to use
		WEP with <literal>open</literal> authentication.  More
		information regarding WEP can be found in the <xref

	    <title>Getting an IP Address with DHCP</title>

	    <para>Once you have selected an access point and set the
	      authentication parameters, you will have to get an IP
	      address to communicate.  Most of time you will obtain
	      your wireless IP address via DHCP.  To achieve that,
	      simply edit <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and add
	      <literal>DHCP</literal> to the configuration for your

	  <title>WPA</title>

	  <para>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a security protocol
	    used together with 802.11 networks to address the lack of
	    proper authentication and the weakness of <link
	    linkend="network-wireless-wep">WEP</link>.  WPA leverages
	    the 802.1X authentication protocol and uses one of several
	    ciphers instead of WEP for data integrity.  The only
	    cipher required by WPA is TKIP (Temporary Key Integrity
	    Protocol) which is a cipher that extends the basic RC4
	    cipher used by WEP by adding integrity checking, tamper
	    detection, and measures for responding to any detected
	    intrusions.  TKIP is designed to work on legacy hardware
	    with only software modification; it represents a
	    compromise that improves security but is still not
	    entirely immune to attack.  WPA also specifies the
	    AES-CCMP cipher as an alternative to TKIP and that is
	    preferred when possible; for this specification the term
	    WPA2 (or RSN) is commonly used.</para>

	  <para>WPA defines authentication and encryption protocols.
	    Authentication is most commonly done using one of two
	    techniques: by 802.1X and a backend authentication service
	    such as RADIUS, or by a minimal handshake between the
	    station and the access point using a pre-shared secret.
	    The former is commonly termed WPA Enterprise with the
	    latter known as WPA Personal.  Since most people will not
	    set up a RADIUS backend server for wireless network,
	    WPA-PSK is by far the most commonly encountered
	    configuration for WPA.</para>

	  <para>The control of the wireless connection and the
	    authentication (key negotiation or authentication with a
	    server) is done with the &man.wpa.supplicant.8; utility.
	    This program requires a configuration file,
	    <filename>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</filename>, to run.
	    More information regarding this file can be found in the
	    &man.wpa.supplicant.conf.5; manual page.</para>

	  <sect5 id="network-wireless-wpa-wpa-psk">
	    <title>WPA-PSK</title>

	    <para>WPA-PSK also known as WPA-Personal is based on a

	      that will be used as the master key in the wireless
	      network.  This means every wireless user will share the
	      same key.  WPA-PSK is intended for small networks where
	      the use of an authentication server is not possible or
	      desired.</para>

	    <title>WPA with EAP-PEAP</title>

	    <para>PEAP (Protected EAP) has been designed as an
	      alternative to EAP-TTLS.  There are two types of PEAP
	      methods, the most common one is PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2.  In
	      the rest of this document, we will use the PEAP term to
	      refer to that EAP method.  PEAP is the most used EAP
	      standard after EAP-TLS, in other words if you have a
	      network with mixed OSes, PEAP should be the most
	      supported standard after EAP-TLS.</para>

	    <para>PEAP is similar to EAP-TTLS: it uses a server-side
	      certificate to authenticate clients by creating an
	      encrypted TLS tunnel between the client and the
	      authentication server, which protects the ensuing
	      exchange of authentication information.  In term of
	      security the difference between EAP-TTLS and PEAP is
	      that PEAP authentication broadcasts the username in
	      clear, only the password is sent in the encrypted TLS
	      tunnel.  EAP-TTLS will use the TLS tunnel for both
	      username and password.</para>

	    <para>We have to edit the
	      <filename>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</filename> file and

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal networks
        operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a range of 10 meters.
        Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from portable devices such as
        cellular phones, handhelds and laptops. Unlike the other popular
        wireless technology, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth offers higher level service
        profiles, e.g. FTP-like file servers, file pushing, voice transport,
        serial line emulation, and more.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth stack in &os; is implemented using the Netgraph
        framework (see &man.netgraph.4;). A broad variety of Bluetooth USB
        dongles is supported by the &man.ng.ubt.4; driver. The Broadcom BCM2033
        chip based Bluetooth devices are supported via the &man.ubtbcmfw.4; and
        &man.ng.ubt.4; drivers. The 3Com Bluetooth PC Card 3CRWB60-A is
        supported by the &man.ng.bt3c.4; driver. Serial and UART based
        Bluetooth devices are supported via &man.sio.4;, &man.ng.h4.4;
        and &man.hcseriald.8;. This section describes the use of the USB
        Bluetooth dongle.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Plugging in the Device</title>
      <para>By default Bluetooth device drivers are available as kernel modules.
        Before attaching a device, you will need to load the driver into the
        kernel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload ng_ubt</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the Bluetooth device is present in the system during system
        startup, load the module from
        <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>ng_ubt_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Plug in your USB dongle. The output similar to the following will
        appear on the console (or in syslog):</para>

      <screen>ubt0: vendor 0x0a12 product 0x0001, rev 1.10/5.25, addr 2

      wMaxPacketSize=49, nframes=6, buffer size=294</screen>

      <para>The <filename>/etc/rc.d/bluetooth</filename> script
        is used to start and stop the Bluetooth stack. It is a good
        idea to stop the stack before unplugging the device, but it is not
        (usually) fatal. When starting the stack, you will receive output similar
        to the following:</para>

      <title>Host Controller Interface (HCI)</title>

      <para>Host Controller Interface (HCI) provides a command interface to the
        baseband controller and link manager, and access to hardware status and
        control registers. This interface provides a uniform method of accessing
        the Bluetooth baseband capabilities. HCI layer on the Host exchanges
        data and commands with the HCI firmware on the Bluetooth hardware.
        The Host Controller Transport Layer (i.e. physical bus) driver provides
        both HCI layers with the ability to exchange information with each
        other.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>hci</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The HCI node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth device driver node (downstream) and
        the L2CAP node (upstream). All HCI operations must be performed
        on the HCI node and not on the device driver node. Default name
        for the HCI node is <quote>devicehci</quote>.
        For more details refer to the &man.ng.hci.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>One of the most common tasks is discovery of Bluetooth devices in
        RF proximity. This operation is called <emphasis>inquiry</emphasis>.
        Inquiry and other HCI related operations are done with the
        &man.hccontrol.8; utility. The example below shows how to find out
        which Bluetooth devices are in range. You should receive the list of
        devices in a few seconds. Note that a remote device will only answer
        the inquiry if it put into <emphasis>discoverable</emphasis>
        mode.</para>

      <para><literal>BD_ADDR</literal> is unique address of a Bluetooth
        device, similar to MAC addresses of a network card. This address
        is needed for further communication with a device. It is possible
        to assign human readable name to a BD_ADDR.
        The <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hosts</filename> file contains information
        regarding the known Bluetooth hosts. The following example shows how
        to obtain human readable name that was assigned to the remote
        device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci remote_name_request 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>

Name: Pav's T39</screen>

      <para>If you perform an inquiry on a remote Bluetooth device, it will
        find your computer as <quote>your.host.name (ubt0)</quote>. The name
        assigned to the local device can be changed at any time.</para>

      <para>The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection (only two
        Bluetooth units involved), or a point-to-multipoint connection. In the
        point-to-multipoint connection the connection is shared among several
        Bluetooth devices. The following example shows how to obtain the list
        of active baseband connections for the local device:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci read_connection_list</userinput>

      <para>A <emphasis>connection handle</emphasis> is useful when termination
        of the baseband connection is required. Note, that it is normally not
        required to do it by hand. The stack will automatically terminate
        inactive baseband connections.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hccontrol -n ubt0hci disconnect 41</userinput>

      <title>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)</title>

      <para>Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) provides
        connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer
        protocols with protocol multiplexing capability and segmentation and
        reassembly operation. L2CAP permits higher level protocols and
        applications to transmit and receive L2CAP data packets up to 64
        kilobytes in length.</para>

      <para>L2CAP is based around the concept of <emphasis>channels</emphasis>.
        Channel is a logical connection on top of baseband connection. Each
        channel is bound to a single protocol in a many-to-one fashion. Multiple
        channels can be bound to the same protocol, but a channel cannot be
        bound to multiple protocols. Each L2CAP packet received on a channel is
        directed to the appropriate higher level protocol. Multiple channels
        can share the same baseband connection.</para>

      <para>A single Netgraph node of type <emphasis>l2cap</emphasis> is
        created for a single Bluetooth device. The L2CAP node is normally
        connected to the Bluetooth HCI node (downstream) and Bluetooth sockets
        nodes (upstream). Default name for the L2CAP node is
        <quote>devicel2cap</quote>. For more details refer to the
        &man.ng.l2cap.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>A useful command is &man.l2ping.8;, which can be used to ping
        other devices. Some Bluetooth implementations might not return all of
        the data sent to them, so <literal>0 bytes</literal> in the following
        example is normal.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>l2ping -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4</userinput>

      <para>The &man.l2control.8; utility is used to perform various operations
        on L2CAP nodes. This example shows how to obtain the list of logical
        connections (channels) and the list of baseband connections for the
        local device:</para>

      <para>The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports over the
        L2CAP protocol. The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10.
        RFCOMM is a simple transport protocol, with additional provisions for
        emulating the 9 circuits of RS-232 (EIATIA-232-E) serial ports. The
        RFCOMM protocol supports up to 60 simultaneous connections (RFCOMM
        channels) between two Bluetooth devices.</para>

      <para>For the purposes of RFCOMM, a complete communication path involves
        two applications running on different devices (the communication
        endpoints) with a communication segment between them. RFCOMM is intended
        to cover applications that make use of the serial ports of the devices
        in which they reside. The communication segment is a Bluetooth link from
        one device to another (direct connect).</para>

      <para>RFCOMM is only concerned with the connection between the devices in
        the direct connect case, or between the device and a modem in the
        network case. RFCOMM can support other configurations, such as modules
        that communicate via Bluetooth wireless technology on one side and
        provide a wired interface on the other side.</para>

      <title>Pairing of Devices</title>

      <para>By default, Bluetooth communication is not authenticated, and any
        device can talk to any other device. A Bluetooth device (for example,
        cellular phone) may choose to require authentication to provide a
        particular service (for example, Dial-Up service). Bluetooth
        authentication is normally done with <emphasis>PIN codes</emphasis>.
        A PIN code is an ASCII string up to 16 characters in length. User is
        required to enter the same PIN code on both devices. Once user has
        entered the PIN code, both devices will generate a
        <emphasis>link key</emphasis>. After that the link key can be stored
        either in the devices themselves or in a persistent storage. Next time
        both devices will use previously generated link key. The described
        above procedure is called <emphasis>pairing</emphasis>. Note that if
        the link key is lost by any device then pairing must be repeated.</para>

      <para>The &man.hcsecd.8; daemon is responsible for handling of all
        Bluetooth authentication requests. The default configuration file is
        <filename>/etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf</filename>. An example section for
        a cellular phone with the PIN code arbitrarily set to
        <quote>1234</quote> is shown below:</para>

      <programlisting>device {
        bdaddr  00:80:37:29:19:a4;
        name    "Pav's T39";
        key     nokey;
        pin     "1234";
      }</programlisting>

      <para>There is no limitation on PIN codes (except length). Some devices
        (for example Bluetooth headsets) may have a fixed PIN code built in.
        The <option>-d</option> switch forces the &man.hcsecd.8; daemon to stay
        in the foreground, so it is easy to see what is happening. Set the
        remote device to receive pairing and initiate the Bluetooth connection
        to the remote device. The remote device should say that pairing was
        accepted, and request the PIN code. Enter the same PIN code as you
        have in <filename>hcsecd.conf</filename>. Now your PC and the remote
        device are paired. Alternatively, you can initiate pairing on the remote
        device.</para>

      <title>Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)</title>
      <para>The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) provides the means for client
        applications to discover the existence of services provided by server
        applications as well as the attributes of those services. The attributes
        of a service include the type or class of service offered and the
        mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the service.</para>

      <para>SDP involves communication between a SDP server and a SDP client.
        The server maintains a list of service records that describe the
        characteristics of services associated with the server. Each service
        record contains information about a single service. A client may 
        retrieve information from a service record maintained by the SDP server
        by issuing a SDP request. If the client, or an application associated
        with the client, decides to use a service, it must open a separate
        connection to the service provider in order to utilize the service.
        SDP provides a mechanism for discovering services and their attributes,
        but it does not provide a mechanism for utilizing those services.</para>

      <para>Normally, a SDP client searches for services based on some desired
        characteristics of the services. However, there are times when it is
        desirable to discover which types of services are described by an SDP
        server's service records without any a priori information about the
        services. This process of looking for any offered services is called
        <emphasis>browsing</emphasis>.</para>
 
      <para>The Bluetooth SDP server &man.sdpd.8; and command line client
        &man.sdpcontrol.8; are included in the standard &os; installation.
        The following example shows how to perform a SDP browse query.</para>

      <para>... and so on. Note that each service has a list of attributes
        (RFCOMM channel for example). Depending on the service you might need to
        make a note of some of the attributes. Some Bluetooth implementations do
        not support service browsing and may return an empty list. In this case
        it is possible to search for the specific service. The example below
        shows how to search for the OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) service:</para>

      <para>Then the <application>sdpd</application> daemon can be started with:</para>

        SDP daemon.</para>

      <para>The list of services registered with the local SDP server can be

      <para>In &os; both profiles are implemented with &man.ppp.8; and
        &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; - a wrapper that converts RFCOMM Bluetooth
        connection into something PPP can operate with. Before any profile
        can be used, a new PPP label in the <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>
        must be created. Consult &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; manual page for examples.
      </para>

      <para>In the following example &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will be used to open
        RFCOMM connection to remote device with BD_ADDR 00:80:37:29:19:a4 on

        from the remote device via SDP. It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel
        by hand, and in this case &man.rfcomm.pppd.8; will not perform SDP
        query. Use &man.sdpcontrol.8; to find out RFCOMM

      <title>OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) Profile</title>
      <para>OBEX is a widely used protocol for simple file transfers between
        mobile devices. Its main use is in infrared communication, where it is
        used for generic file transfers between notebooks or PDAs,
        and for sending business cards or calendar entries between cellular
        phones and other devices with PIM applications.</para>

      <para>The OBEX server and client are implemented as a third-party package
        <application>obexapp</application>, which is available as
	<filename role="package">comms/obexapp</filename> port.</para>

      <para>OBEX client is used to push and/or pull objects from the OBEX server.
        An object can, for example, be a business card or an appointment.
        The OBEX client can obtain RFCOMM channel number from the remote device
        via SDP. This can be done by specifying service name instead of RFCOMM
        channel number. Supported service names are: IrMC, FTRN and OPUSH.
        It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel as a number. Below is an
        example of an OBEX session, where device information object is pulled
        from the cellular phone, and a new object (business card) is pushed
        into the phone's directory.</para>

      <para>In order to provide OBEX Object Push service,

        objects will be stored, must be created. The default path to the root
        folder is <filename>/var/spool/obex</filename>. Finally, start OBEX
        server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The OBEX server will
        automatically register OBEX Object Push service with the local SDP
        daemon. The example below shows how to start OBEX server.</para>

      <title>Serial Port Profile (SPP)</title>
      <para>The Serial Port Profile (SPP) allows Bluetooth devices to perform
        RS232 (or similar) serial cable emulation. The scenario covered by this
        profile deals with legacy applications using Bluetooth as a cable
        replacement, through a virtual serial port abstraction.</para>

      <para>The &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; utility implements the Serial Port profile.
        A pseudo tty is used as a virtual serial port abstraction. The example
        below shows how to connect to a remote device Serial Port service.
        Note that you do not have to specify a RFCOMM channel -
        &man.rfcomm.sppd.1; can obtain it from the remote device via SDP.
        If you would like to override this, specify a RFCOMM channel on the
        command line.</para>

        <title>A remote device cannot connect</title>
        <para>Some older Bluetooth devices do not support role switching.
          By default, when &os; is accepting a new connection, it tries to
          perform a role switch and become master. Devices, which do not
          support this will not be able to connect. Note that role switching is
          performed when a new connection is being established, so it is not
          possible to ask the remote device if it does support role switching.
          There is a HCI option to disable role switching on the local

	  <filename role="package">comms/hcidump</filename> port.
          The <application>hcidump</application> utility is similar to

      <para>It is sometimes useful to divide one physical network
	(such as an Ethernet segment) into two separate network
	segments without having to create IP subnets and use a router
	to connect the segments together.  A device that connects two
	networks together in this fashion is called a
	<quote>bridge</quote>.  A FreeBSD system with two network
	interface cards can act as a bridge.</para>

      <para>The bridge works by learning the MAC layer addresses
	(Ethernet addresses) of the devices on each of its network interfaces.
	It forwards traffic between two networks only when its source and
	destination are on different networks.</para>

      <para>In many respects, a bridge is like an Ethernet switch with very
	few ports.</para>

      <title>Situations Where Bridging Is Appropriate</title>

      <para>There are many common situations in which a bridge is used
	today.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting Networks</title>

	<para>The basic operation of a bridge is to join two or more
	  network segments together.  There are many reasons to use a
	  host based bridge over plain networking equipment such as
	  cabling constraints, firewalling or connecting pseudo
	  networks such as a Virtual Machine interface.  A bridge can
	  also connect a wireless interface running in hostap mode to
	  a wired network and act as an access point.</para>

	<title>Filtering/Traffic Shaping Firewall</title>
	<indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>NAT</primary></indexterm>

	<para>A common situation is where firewall functionality is
	  needed without routing or network address translation (NAT).</para>

	<para>An example is a small company that is connected via DSL
	  or ISDN to their ISP.  They have a 13 globally-accessible IP
	  addresses from their ISP and have 10 PCs on their network.
	  In this situation, using a router-based firewall is
	  difficult because of subnetting issues.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>router</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>DSL</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>ISDN</primary></indexterm>
	<para>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and dropped into the
	  path just downstream of their DSL/ISDN router without any IP
	  numbering issues.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Network Tap</title>

	<para>A bridge can join two network segments and be used to
	  inspect all Ethernet frames that pass between them.  This can
	  either be from using &man.bpf.4;/&man.tcpdump.1; on the
	  bridge interface or by sending a copy of all frames out an
	  additional interface (span port).</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Layer 2 VPN</title>

	<para>Two Ethernet networks can be joined across an IP link by
	  bridging the networks to an EtherIP tunnel or a &man.tap.4;
	  based solution such as OpenVPN.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Layer 2 Redundancy</title>

	<para>A network can be connected together with multiple links
	  and use the Spanning Tree Protocol to block redundant paths.
	  For an Ethernet network to function properly only one active
	  path can exist between two devices, Spanning Tree will
	  detect loops and put the redundant links into a blocked
	  state.  Should one of the active links fail then the
	  protocol will calculate a different tree and reenable one of
	  the blocked paths to restore connectivity to all points in
	  the network.</para>

      <para>The bridge driver is a kernel module and will be
	automatically loaded by &man.ifconfig.8; when creating a
	bridge interface.  It is possible to compile the bridge in to
	the kernel by adding <literal>device if_bridge</literal> to
	your kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>Packet filtering can be used with any firewall package
	that hooks in via the &man.pfil.9; framework.  The firewall

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Enabling the Bridge</title>

      <para>The bridge is created using interface cloning.  To create
	a bridge use &man.ifconfig.8;, if the bridge driver is not
	present in the kernel then it will be loaded
	automatically.</para>

      <para>A bridge interface is created and is automatically
	assigned a randomly generated Ethernet address.  The
	<literal>maxaddr</literal> and <literal>timeout</literal>
	parameters control how many MAC addresses the bridge will keep
	in its forwarding table and how many seconds before each entry
	is removed after it is last seen.  The other parameters
	control how Spanning Tree operates.</para>

      <para>Add the member network interfaces to the bridge.  For the
	bridge to forward packets all member interfaces and the bridge
	need to be up:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm fxp0 addm fxp1 up</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig fxp0 up</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig fxp1 up</userinput></screen>

      <para>The bridge is now forwarding Ethernet frames between
	<devicename>fxp0</devicename> and
	<devicename>fxp1</devicename>.  The equivalent configuration
	in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> so the bridge is created
	at startup is:</para>

      <programlisting>cloned_interfaces="bridge0"
ifconfig_bridge0="addm fxp0 addm fxp1 up"
ifconfig_fxp0="up"
ifconfig_fxp1="up"</programlisting>

      <para>If the bridge host needs an IP address then the correct
	place to set this is on the bridge interface itself rather
	than one of the member interfaces.  This can be set statically
	or via DHCP:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 inet 192.168.0.1/24</userinput></screen>

      <para>It is also possible to assign an IPv6 address to a bridge

    <sect2>
      <title>Firewalling</title>
      <indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm>

      <para>When packet filtering is enabled, bridged packets will
	pass through the filter inbound on the originating interface,
	on the bridge interface and outbound on the appropriate
	interfaces.  Either stage can be disabled.  When direction of
	the packet flow is important it is best to firewall on the
	member interfaces rather than the bridge itself.</para>

      <para>The bridge has several configurable settings for passing
	non-IP and ARP packets, and layer2 firewalling with IPFW.  See
	&man.if.bridge.4; for more information.</para>

      <title>Spanning Tree</title>

      <para>The bridge driver implements the Rapid Spanning Tree
	Protocol (RSTP or 802.1w) with backwards compatibility with
	the legacy Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).  Spanning Tree is
	used to detect and remove loops in a network topology.  RSTP
	provides faster Spanning Tree convergence than legacy STP, the
	protocol will exchange information with neighbouring switches
	to quickly transition to forwarding without creating
	loops.
	&os; supports RSTP and STP as operating modes, with RSTP
	being the default mode.</para>

      <para>Spanning Tree can be enabled on member interfaces using
	the <literal>stp</literal> command.  For a bridge with
	<devicename>fxp0</devicename> and

	<title>Reconstruct Traffic Flows</title>

	<para>The bridge supports monitor mode, where the packets are
	  discarded after &man.bpf.4; processing, and are not
	  processed or forwarded further.  This can be used to
	  multiplex the input of two or more interfaces into a single
	  &man.bpf.4; stream.  This is useful for reconstructing the
	  traffic for network taps that transmit the RX/TX signals out
	  through two separate interfaces.</para>

	<para>To read the input from four network interfaces as one
	  stream:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm fxp0 addm fxp1 addm fxp2 addm fxp3 monitor up</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tcpdump -i bridge0</userinput></screen>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Span Ports</title>

	<para>A copy of every Ethernet frame received by the bridge
	  will be transmitted out a designated span port.  The number
	  of span ports configured on a bridge is unlimited, if an
	  interface is designated as a span port then it may not also
	  be used as a regular bridge port.  This is most useful for
	  snooping a bridged network passively on another host
	  connected to one of the span ports of the bridge.</para>

	<para>To send a copy of all frames out the interface named
	  <devicename>fxp4</devicename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 span fxp4</userinput></screen>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Private Interfaces</title>

	<para>A private interface does not forward any traffic to any
	  other port that is also a private interface.  The traffic is
	  blocked unconditionally so no Ethernet frames will be
	  forwarded, including ARP.  If traffic needs to be
	  selectively blocked then a firewall should be used
	  instead.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Sticky Interfaces</title>

	<para>If a bridge member interface is marked as sticky then
	  dynamically learned address entries are treated at static once
	  entered into the forwarding cache.  Sticky entries are never
	  aged out of the cache or replaced, even if the address is seen
	  on a different interface.  This gives the benefit of static
	  address entries without the need to pre-populate the
	  forwarding table, clients learnt on a particular segment of
	  the bridge can not roam to another segment.</para>

	<para>Another example of using sticky addresses would be to
	  combine the bridge with VLANs to create a router where
	  customer networks are isolated without wasting IP address
	  space.  Consider that <hostid
	  role="Hostname">CustomerA</hostid> is on
	  <literal>vlan100</literal> and <hostid
	  role="hostname">CustomerB</hostid> is on
	  <literal>vlan101</literal>.  The bridge has the address
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid> and is also an
	  internet router.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 addm vlan100 sticky vlan100 addm vlan101 sticky vlan101</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 inet 192.168.0.1/24</userinput></screen>

	<para>Both clients see <hostid
	  role="ipaddr">192.168.0.1</hostid> as their default gateway
	  and since the bridge cache is sticky they can not spoof the
	  MAC address of the other customer to intercept their
	  traffic.</para>

	<para>Any communication between the VLANs can be blocked using
	  private interfaces (or a firewall):</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 private vlan100 private vlan101</userinput></screen>

	<para>The customers are completely isolated from each other,
	  the full <hostid role="netmask">/24</hostid> address range
	  can be allocated without subnetting.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Address limits</title>

	<para>The number of unique source MAC addresses behind an
	  interface can be limited.  Once the limit is reached packets
	  with unknown source addresses are dropped until an
	  existing host cache entry expires or is removed.</para>

	<para>The following example sets the maximum number of Ethernet
	  devices for <hostid role="Hostname">CustomerA</hostid> on
	  <literal>vlan100</literal> to 10.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig bridge0 ifmaxaddr vlan100 10</userinput></screen>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>SNMP Monitoring</title>

	<para>The bridge interface and STP parameters can be monitored
	  via the SNMP daemon which is included in the &os; base
	  system.  The exported bridge MIBs conform to the IETF
	  standards so any SNMP client or monitoring package can be
	  used to retrieve the data.</para>

	<para>On the bridge machine uncomment the
	  <literal>begemotSnmpdModulePath."bridge" =
	  "/usr/lib/snmp_bridge.so"</literal> line from
	  <filename>/etc/snmp.config</filename> and start the
	  <application>bsnmpd</application> daemon. Other
	  configuration such as community names and access lists may
	  need to be modified.  See &man.bsnmpd.1; and
	  &man.snmp.bridge.3; for more information.</para>

	<para>The following examples use the
	  <application>Net-SNMP</application> software (<filename
	  role="package">net-mgmt/net-snmp</filename>) to query a
	  bridge, the <filename
	  role="package">net-mgmt/bsnmptools</filename> port can also
	  be used.  From the SNMP client host add to
	  <filename>$HOME/.snmp/snmp.conf</filename> the following
	  lines to import the bridge MIB definitions in to
	  <application>Net-SNMP</application>:</para>

    <para>A FreeBSD machine can boot over the network and operate without a

    <para>There are many ways to set up diskless workstations.  Many

	<para>The diskless workstations use a shared

	<para>The root file system is a copy of a

    </itemizedlist>

    <caution><para>As described, this system is insecure.  It should

    <para>All the information in this section has been tested

    <sect2>
      <title>Background Information</title>

      <para>Setting up diskless workstations is both relatively
	straightforward and prone to errors.  These are sometimes
	difficult to diagnose for a number of reasons.  For example:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Compile time options may determine different behaviors at
	    runtime.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Error messages are often cryptic or totally absent.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In this context, having some knowledge of the background
	mechanisms involved is very useful to solve the problems that
	may arise.</para>

      <para>Several operations need to be performed for a successful
	bootstrap:</para>
        
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to obtain initial parameters such as its IP
	    address, executable filename, server name, root path.  This is
	    done using the <acronym>DHCP</acronym> or BOOTP protocols.
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> is a compatible extension of BOOTP, and
	    uses the same port numbers and basic packet format.</para>

	  <para>It is possible to configure a system to use only BOOTP.
	    The &man.bootpd.8; server program is included in the base &os;
	    system.</para>

	  <para>However, <acronym>DHCP</acronym> has a number of advantages
	    over BOOTP (nicer configuration files, possibility of using
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, plus many others not directly related to
	    diskless operation), and we will describe mainly a
	    <acronym>DHCP</acronym> configuration, with equivalent examples
	    using &man.bootpd.8; when possible.  The sample configuration will
	    use the <application>ISC DHCP</application> software package
	    (release 3.0.1.r12 was installed on the test server).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The machine needs to transfer one or several programs to local
	    memory.  Either <acronym>TFTP</acronym> or <acronym>NFS</acronym>
	    are used.  The choice between <acronym>TFTP</acronym> and
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is a compile time option in several places.
	    A common source of error is to specify filenames for the wrong
	    protocol: <acronym>TFTP</acronym> typically transfers all files from
	    a single directory on the server, and would expect filenames
	    relative to this directory.  <acronym>NFS</acronym> needs absolute
	    file paths.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The possible intermediate bootstrap programs and the kernel
	    need to be initialized and executed.  There are several important
	    variations in this area:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> will load &man.pxeboot.8;, which is
		a modified version of the &os; third stage loader.  The
		&man.loader.8; will obtain most parameters necessary to system
		startup, and leave them in the kernel environment before
		transferring control.  It is possible to use a
		<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel in this case.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><application>Etherboot</application>, will directly
		load the kernel, with less preparation.  You will need to
		build a kernel with specific options.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para><acronym>PXE</acronym> and <application>Etherboot</application>
	    work equally well; however, because kernels
	    normally let the &man.loader.8; do more work for them,
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym> is the preferred method.</para>

	  <para>If your <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and network cards support
	    <acronym>PXE</acronym>, you should probably use it.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Finally, the machine needs to access its file systems.
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> is used in all cases.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

	<para>If using <application>Etherboot</application>, you need to

	  with the following options (in addition to the usual ones):</para>

	<programlisting>
options     BOOTP          # Use BOOTP to obtain IP address/hostname
options     BOOTP_NFSROOT  # NFS mount root file system using BOOTP info
	</programlisting>

	<para>You may also want to use <literal>BOOTP_NFSV3</literal>,
	  <literal>BOOT_COMPAT</literal> and <literal>BOOTP_WIRED_TO</literal>
	  (refer to <filename>NOTES</filename>).</para>

	<para>These option names are historical and slightly misleading as
	  they actually enable indifferent use of <acronym>DHCP</acronym> and
	  BOOTP inside the kernel (it is also possible to force strict BOOTP
	  or <acronym>DHCP</acronym> use).</para>

	<para>Build the kernel (see <xref linkend="kernelconfig">),

	<note>
	  <para>When using <acronym>PXE</acronym>, building a kernel with the
	  above options is not strictly necessary (though suggested).
	  Enabling them will cause more <acronym>DHCP</acronym> requests to be
	  issued during kernel startup, with a small risk of inconsistency
	  between the new values and those retrieved by &man.pxeboot.8; in some
	  special cases.  The advantage of using them is that the host name
	  will be set as a side effect.  Otherwise you will need to set the
	  host name by another method, for example in a client-specific
	  <filename>rc.conf</filename> file.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>In order to be loadable with

    <title>PXE Booting with an NFS root file system</title>

    <para>The &intel; Preboot eXecution Environment (<acronym>PXE</acronym>)
      allows booting the operating system over the network.
      <acronym>PXE</acronym> support is usually provided in the
      <acronym>BIOS</acronym> of modern motherboards, where
      it can be enabled in the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> settings
      which enable booting from the network.  A fully functioning
      <acronym>PXE</acronym> setup also requires properly configured
      <acronym>DHCP</acronym> and <acronym>TFTP</acronym> servers.</para>

    <para>When the host computer boots, it receives information over
      <acronym>DHCP</acronym> about where to obtain the initial boot
      loader via TFTP.  After the host computer receives this information,
      it downloads the boot loader via <acronym>TFTP</acronym>, and then
      executes the boot loader.  This is documented in section 2.2.1 of the
      <ulink url="http://download.intel.com/design/archives/wfm/downloads/pxespec.pdf">Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) Specification</ulink>.
      In &os;, the boot loader retrieved during the <acronym>PXE</acronym>
      process is <filename>/boot/pxeboot</filename>.  After
      <filename>/boot/pxeboot</filename> executes, the &os; kernel is
      loaded, and the rest of the &os; bootup sequence proceeds.
      Refer to <xref linkend="boot"> for more information about
      the &os; booting process.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD's ISDN implementation supports only the DSS1/Q.931
	(or Euro-ISDN) standard using passive cards.  Some active cards
	are supported where the firmware
	also supports other signaling protocols; this also includes the

      <para>The <application>isdn4bsd</application> software allows you to connect

	userland &man.ppp.8;, channel bonding of two or more ISDN
	B-channels is possible.  A telephone answering machine
	application is also available as well as many utilities such as
	a software 300 Baud modem.</para>

      <para>Some growing number of PC ISDN cards are supported under
	FreeBSD and the reports show that it is successfully used all
	over Europe and in many other parts of the world.</para>

      <para>The passive ISDN cards supported are mostly the ones with
	the Infineon (formerly Siemens) ISAC/HSCX/IPAC ISDN chipsets,
	but also ISDN cards with chips from Cologne Chip (ISA bus only),
	PCI cards with Winbond W6692 chips, some cards with the
	Tiger300/320/ISAC chipset combinations and some vendor specific
	chipset based cards such as the AVM Fritz!Card PCI V.1.0 and the

      <title>ISDN Terminal Adapters</title>

      <para>Terminal adapters (TA), are to ISDN what modems are to regular
	phone lines.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>modem</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Most TA's use the standard Hayes modem AT command set, and can be
	used as a drop in replacement for a modem.</para>

      <para>A TA will operate basically the same as a modem except connection
	and throughput speeds will be much faster than your old modem.  You
	will need to configure <link linkend="ppp">PPP</link> exactly the same
	as for a modem setup.  Make sure you set your serial speed as high as
	possible.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>PPP</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The main advantage of using a TA to connect to an Internet
	Provider is that you can do Dynamic PPP.  As IP address space becomes
	more and more scarce, most providers are not willing to provide you
	with a static IP anymore.  Most stand-alone routers are not able to
	accommodate dynamic IP allocation.</para>

      <para>TA's completely rely on the PPP daemon that you are running for
	their features and stability of connection.  This allows you to
	upgrade easily from using a modem to ISDN on a FreeBSD machine, if you
	already have PPP set up.  However, at the same time any problems you
	experienced with the PPP program and are going to persist.</para>

      <para>If you want maximum stability, use the kernel <link
	  linkend="ppp">PPP</link> option, not the <link
	  linkend="userppp">userland PPP</link>.</para>

      <para>The following TA's are known to work with FreeBSD:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Motorola BitSurfer and Bitsurfer Pro</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Adtran</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Most other TA's will probably work as well, TA vendors try to make
	sure their product can accept most of the standard modem AT command
	set.</para>

      <para>The real problem with external TA's is that, like modems,
	you need a good serial card in your computer.</para>

      <para>You should read the <ulink
	url="&url.articles.serial-uart;/index.html">FreeBSD Serial
	Hardware</ulink> tutorial for a detailed understanding of
	serial devices, and the differences between asynchronous and
	synchronous serial ports.</para>

      <para>A TA running off a standard PC serial port (asynchronous) limits
	you to 115.2&nbsp;Kbs, even though you have a 128&nbsp;Kbs connection.
	To fully utilize the 128&nbsp;Kbs that ISDN is capable of,
	you must move the TA to a synchronous serial card.</para>

      <para>Do not be fooled into buying an internal TA and thinking you have
	avoided the synchronous/asynchronous issue.  Internal TA's simply have
	a standard PC serial port chip built into them.  All this will do is
	save you having to buy another serial cable and find another empty
	electrical socket.</para>

      <para>A synchronous card with a TA is at least as fast as a stand-alone
	router, and with a simple 386 FreeBSD box driving it, probably more
	flexible.</para>

      <para>The choice of synchronous card/TA v.s. stand-alone router is largely a
	religious issue.  There has been some discussion of this in
	the mailing lists.  We suggest you search the <ulink
	url="&url.base;/search/index.html">archives</ulink> for
	the complete discussion.</para>

        <primary>ISDN</primary>
	<secondary>stand-alone bridges/routers</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>ISDN bridges or routers are not at all specific to FreeBSD
	or any other operating system.  For a more complete
	description of routing and bridging technology, please refer
	to a networking reference book.</para>

      <para>In the context of this section, the terms router and bridge will
	be used interchangeably.</para>

      <para>As the cost of low end ISDN routers/bridges comes down, it
	will likely become a more and more popular choice.  An ISDN
	router is a small box that plugs directly into your local
	Ethernet network, and manages its own connection to the other
	bridge/router.  It has built in software to communicate via
	PPP and other popular protocols.</para>

      <para>A router will allow you much faster throughput than a
	standard TA, since it will be using a full synchronous ISDN
	connection.</para>

      <para>The main problem with ISDN routers and bridges is that
	interoperability between manufacturers can still be a problem.
	If you are planning to connect to an Internet provider, you
	should discuss your needs with them.</para>

      <para>If you are planning to connect two LAN segments together,
	such as your home LAN to the office LAN, this is the simplest
	lowest
	maintenance solution.  Since you are buying the equipment for
	both sides of the connection you can be assured that the link
	will work.</para>

      <para>For example to connect a home computer or branch office
	network to a head office network the following setup could be
	used:</para>

      <example>
	<title>Branch Office or Home Network</title>

      <para>One large advantage of most routers/bridges is that they allow you
	to have 2 <emphasis>separate independent</emphasis> PPP connections to
	2 separate sites at the <emphasis>same</emphasis> time.  This is not
	supported on most TA's, except for specific (usually expensive) models
	that
	have two serial ports.  Do not confuse this with channel bonding, MPP,
	etc.</para>

      <para>This can be a very useful feature if, for example, you
	have an dedicated ISDN connection at your office and would
	like to tap into it, but do not want to get another ISDN line
	at work.  A router at the office location can manage a
	dedicated B channel connection (64&nbsp;Kbps) to the Internet
	and use the other B channel for a separate data connection.
	The second B channel can be used for dial-in, dial-out or
	dynamically bonding (MPP, etc.) with the first B channel for
	more bandwidth.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>IPX/SPX</primary></indexterm>
      <para>An Ethernet bridge will also allow you to transmit more than just
	IP traffic.  You can also send IPX/SPX or whatever other protocols you

      <para>FreeBSD's Network Address Translation daemon, commonly known as
        &man.natd.8; is a daemon that accepts incoming raw IP packets,
        changes the source to the local machine and re-injects these packets
        back into the outgoing IP packet stream.  &man.natd.8; does this by changing
        the source IP address and port such that when data is received back,
        it is able to determine the original location of the data and forward
        it back to its original requester.</para>

      <title>Setup</title>
      <para>Due to the diminishing IP space in IPv4, and the increased number
        of users on high-speed consumer lines such as cable or DSL, people are
        increasingly in need of an Internet Connection Sharing solution.  The
        ability to connect several computers online through one connection and
        IP address makes &man.natd.8; a reasonable choice.</para>

      <para>Most commonly, a user has a machine connected to a cable or DSL
        line with one IP address and wishes to use this one connected computer to
        provide Internet access to several more over a LAN.</para>

      <para>To do this, the FreeBSD machine on the Internet must act as a
        gateway.  This gateway machine must have two NICs&mdash;one for connecting
        to the Internet router, the other connecting to a LAN.  All the
        machines on the LAN are connected through a hub or switch.</para>

    <sect2 id="network-natdport-redirection">
      <title>Port Redirection</title>

      <para>The drawback with &man.natd.8; is that the LAN clients are not accessible
        from the Internet.  Clients on the LAN can make outgoing connections to
        the world but cannot receive incoming ones.  This presents a problem
        if trying to run Internet services on one of the LAN client machines.
        A simple way around this is to redirect selected Internet ports on the
        <application>natd</application> machine to a LAN client.
      </para>

      <para>For example, an IRC server runs on client <hostid>A</hostid>, and a web server runs
        on client <hostid>B</hostid>.  For this to work properly, connections received on ports
        6667 (IRC) and 80 (web) must be redirected to the respective machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> must be passed to
        &man.natd.8; with the proper options.  The syntax is as follows:</para>
      <programlisting>     -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                 [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                 [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]</programlisting>

      <para>In the above example, the argument should be:</para>

        <programlisting>    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
    -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80</programlisting>

      <para>
        This will redirect the proper <emphasis>tcp</emphasis> ports to the
        LAN client machines.
      </para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_port</option> argument can be used to indicate port
        ranges over individual ports.  For example, <replaceable>tcp
        192.168.0.2:2000-3000 2000-3000</replaceable> would redirect
        all connections received on ports 2000 to 3000 to ports 2000
        to 3000 on client <hostid>A</hostid>.</para>

      <para>These options can be used when directly running
        &man.natd.8;, placed within the
        <literal>natd_flags=""</literal> option in
        <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
	or passed via a configuration file.</para>

      <title>Address Redirection</title>
      <indexterm><primary>address redirection</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Address redirection is useful if several IP addresses are
        available, yet they must be on one machine.  With this,
        &man.natd.8; can assign each LAN client its own external IP address.
        &man.natd.8; then rewrites outgoing packets from the LAN clients
        with the proper external IP address and redirects
        all traffic incoming on that particular IP address back to
        the specific LAN client.  This is also known as static NAT.
        For example, the IP addresses <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.1</hostid>,
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.2</hostid>, and
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.3</hostid> belong to the <application>natd</application> gateway
        machine.  <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.1</hostid> can be used
        as the <application>natd</application> gateway machine's external IP address, while
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.2</hostid> and
        <hostid role="ipaddr">128.1.1.3</hostid> are forwarded back to LAN
        clients <hostid>A</hostid> and <hostid>B</hostid>.</para>

      <para>The <option>-redirect_address</option> syntax is as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>-redirect_address localIP publicIP</programlisting>


      <informaltable frame="none" pgwide="1">

          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </informaltable>

    <title>IPv6</title>
    <para>IPv6 (also known as IPng <quote>IP next generation</quote>) is
      the new version of the well known IP protocol (also known as
      <acronym>IPv4</acronym>).  Like the other current *BSD systems,
      FreeBSD includes the KAME IPv6 reference implementation.
      So your FreeBSD system comes with all you will need to experiment with IPv6.
      This section focuses on getting IPv6 configured and running.</para>

    <para>In the early 1990s, people became aware of the rapidly
      diminishing address space of IPv4.  Given the expansion rate of the
      Internet there were two major concerns:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Running out of addresses.  Today this is not so much of a concern
	  anymore since RFC1918 private address space
	  (<hostid role="ipaddr">10.0.0.0/8</hostid>,
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">172.16.0.0/12</hostid>, and
	  <hostid role="ipaddr">192.168.0.0/16</hostid>)
	  and Network Address Translation (<acronym>NAT</acronym>) are
	  being employed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Router table entries were getting too large.  This is
	  still a concern today.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>IPv6 deals with these and many other issues:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>128 bit address space.  In other words theoretically there are
	  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses
	  available.  This means there are approximately
	  6.67 * 10^27 IPv6 addresses per square meter on our planet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Routers will only store network aggregation addresses in their routing
	  tables thus reducing the average space of a routing table to 8192
	  entries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are also lots of other useful features of IPv6 such as:</para>

      <title>Background on IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>There are different types of IPv6 addresses: Unicast, Anycast and
	Multicast.</para>

      <para>Unicast addresses are the well known addresses.  A packet sent
	to a unicast address arrives exactly at the interface belonging to
	the address.</para>

      <para>Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast
	addresses but they address a group of interfaces.  The packet destined for
	an anycast address will arrive at the nearest (in router metric)
	interface.  Anycast addresses may only be used by routers.</para>

      <para>Multicast addresses identify a group of interfaces.  A packet destined
	for a multicast address will arrive at all interfaces belonging to the
	multicast group.</para>

	<note><para>The IPv4 broadcast address (usually <hostid role="ipaddr">xxx.xxx.xxx.255</hostid>) is expressed
	  by multicast addresses in IPv6.</para></note>

      <title>Reading IPv6 Addresses</title>
      <para>The canonical form is represented as: <hostid role="ip6addr">x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x</hostid>, each
	<quote>x</quote> being a 16 Bit hex value.  For example
	<hostid role="ip6addr">FEBC:A574:382B:23C1:AA49:4592:4EFE:9982</hostid></para>

      <para>Often an address will have long substrings of all zeros
	therefore one such substring per address can be abbreviated by <quote>::</quote>.
	Also up to three leading <quote>0</quote>s per hexquad can be omitted.
	For example <hostid role="ip6addr">fe80::1</hostid>
	corresponds to the canonical form
	<hostid role="ip6addr">fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</hostid>.</para>

      <para>A third form is to write the last 32 Bit part in the
	well known (decimal) IPv4 style with dots <quote>.</quote>
	as separators.  For example
	<hostid role="ip6addr">2002::10.0.0.1</hostid>
	corresponds to the (hexadecimal) canonical representation
	<hostid role="ip6addr">2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0a00:0001</hostid>
	which in turn is equivalent to
	writing <hostid role="ip6addr">2002::a00:1</hostid>.</para>

      <title>Configuring classical IP over ATM (PVCs)</title>

      <para>Classical IP over ATM (<acronym>CLIP</acronym>) is the
	simplest method to use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
	with IP.  It can be used with
	switched connections (SVCs) and with permanent connections
	(PVCs).  This section describes how to set up a network based
	on PVCs.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Fully meshed configurations</title>

	<para>The first method to set up a <acronym>CLIP</acronym> with
	  PVCs is to connect each machine to each other machine in the
	  network via a dedicated PVC.  While this is simple to
	  configure it tends to become impractical for a larger number
	  of machines.  The example supposes that we have four
	  machines in the network, each connected to the <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> network
	  with an <acronym role="Asynchronous Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> adapter card.  The first step is the planning of
	  the IP addresses and the <acronym role="Asynchronous
	  Transfer Mode">ATM</acronym> connections between the
	  machines.  We use the following:</para>

	<para>The VPI and VCI values at each end of the connection may
	  of course differ, but for simplicity we assume that they are
	  the same.  Next we need to configure the ATM interfaces on
	  each host:</para>

	<screen>hostA&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.1 up</userinput>
hostB&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.2 up</userinput>

hostD&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig hatm0 192.168.173.4 up</userinput></screen>

	<para>assuming that the ATM interface is
	  <devicename>hatm0</devicename> on all hosts.  Now the PVCs
	  need to be configured on <hostid>hostA</hostid> (we assume that
	  they are already configured on the ATM switches, you need to
	  consult the manual for the switch on how to do this).</para>

	<para>Of course other traffic contracts than UBR can be used
	  given the ATM adapter supports those.  In this case the name

    <para>The Common Address Redundancy Protocol, or

      <title>Using CARP For Server Availability (CARP)</title>

      <para>One use of <acronym>CARP</acronym>, as noted above, is for
	server availability.  This example will provide failover support
	for three hosts, all with unique <acronym>IP</acronym>
	addresses and providing the same web content.  These machines will
	act in conjunction with a Round Robin <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	configuration.  The failover machine will have two additional
	<acronym>CARP</acronym> interfaces, one for each of the content
	server's <acronym>IP</acronym>s.  When a failure occurs, the
	failover server should pick up the failed machine's
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address.  This means the failure should
	go completely unnoticed to the user.  The failover server
	requires identical content and services as the other content
	servers it is expected to pick up load for.</para>

      <para>The two machines should be configured identically other
	than their issued hostnames and <acronym>VHID</acronym>s.
	This example calls these machines
	<hostid>hosta.example.org</hostid> and
	<hostid>hostb.example.org</hostid> respectively.  First, the
	required lines for a <acronym>CARP</acronym> configuration have
	to be added to <filename>rc.conf</filename>.  For
	<hostid>hosta.example.org</hostid>, the
	<filename>rc.conf</filename> file should contain the following
	lines:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="hosta.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 1 pass testpass 192.168.1.50/24"</programlisting>

      <para>On <hostid>hostb.example.org</hostid> the following lines
	should be in <filename>rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="hostb.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.4 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 2 pass testpass 192.168.1.51/24"</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>It is very important that the passwords, specified by the
	  <option>pass</option> option to <command>ifconfig</command>,
	  are identical.  The <devicename>carp</devicename> devices will
	  only listen to and accept advertisements from machines with the
	  correct password.  The <acronym>VHID</acronym> must also be
	  different for each machine.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The third machine,
	<hostid>provider.example.org</hostid>, should be prepared so that
	it may handle failover from either host.  This machine will require
	two <devicename>carp</devicename> devices, one to handle each
	host.  The appropriate <filename>rc.conf</filename>
	configuration lines will be similar to the following:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="provider.example.org"
ifconfig_fxp0="inet 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0"
cloned_interfaces="carp0 carp1"
ifconfig_carp0="vhid 1 advskew 100 pass testpass 192.168.1.50/24"
ifconfig_carp1="vhid 2 advskew 100 pass testpass 192.168.1.51/24"</programlisting>

      <para>Having the two <devicename>carp</devicename> devices will
        allow <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid> to notice and pick
	up the <acronym>IP</acronym> address of either machine should
	it stop responding.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The default &os; kernel <emphasis>may</emphasis> have
	  preemption enabled.  If so,
	  <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid> may not relinquish the
	  <acronym>IP</acronym> address back to the original content
	  server.  In this case, an administrator may have to manually
	  force the IP back to the master.  The following command
	  should be issued on
	  <hostid>provider.example.org</hostid>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig carp0 down && ifconfig carp0 up</userinput></screen>

	<para>This should be done on the <devicename>carp</devicename>
	  interface which corresponds to the correct host.</para>
      </note>

      <para>At this point, <acronym>CARP</acronym> should be completely
	enabled and available for testing.  For testing, either networking has
	to be restarted or the machines need to be rebooted.</para>

      <para>More information is always available in the &man.carp.4;
        manual page.</para>

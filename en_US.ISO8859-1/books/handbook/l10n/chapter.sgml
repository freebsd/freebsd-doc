    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>This section of the handbook discusses the internationalization
      and localization of FreeBSD to different countries and different
      settings.  If the users wish to use languages other than the system
      default English, he/she will have to setup the system accordingly.
      Please note that language support for each language varies in level.
      Hence, the user should contact the respective FreeBSD local group
      that is responsible for each language.</para>

    <para>The author realizes that he may have been incomplete in the
      description of the i18n process in FreeBSD.  Due to the various
      levels of i18n implementation in both the system and applicational
      levels, we advise you to refer to individual documentation, man
      pages, READMEs, and so forth.</para>

    <para>Should you have any questions or suggestions regarding this
      chapter, please email the author.</para>

    <title>The Basics</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>What is i18n/l10n?</title>

      <para>Developers shortened internationalization into the term i18n,
	counting the number of letters between the first and the last
	letters of internationalization.  l10n uses the same naming
	scheme, coming from &ldquo;localization&rdquo;.  Combined
	together, i18n/l10n methods, protocols, and applications allow
	users to use languages of their choice.</para>

      <para>I18n applications are programmed using i18n kits under
	libraries.  It allows for developers to write a simple file and
	translate displayed menus and texts to each language.  We strongly
	encourage programmers to follow this convention.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Why should I use i18n/l10n?</title>

      <para>I18n/l10n is used whenever you wish to either view, input, or
	process data in non-English languages.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>What languages are supported in the i18n effort?</title>

      <para>I18n and l10n are not FreeBSD specific.  Currently, one can
	choose from most of the major languages of the World, including
	but not limited to:  Chinese, German, Japanese, French, Russian,
	and others.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="using-localization">
    <title>Using Localization</title>

    <para>In all its splendor, i18n is not FreeBSD-specific and is a
      convention.  We encourage you to help FreeBSD in following this
      convention.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Language Codes</title>

      <para>In order to localize a FreeBSD system to a specific language
	(or any other i18n-supporting UNIX's), the user needs to find out
	the language code for the specify country and language. Country
	codes tell applications what language to use.  In addition, web
	browsers, SMTP/POP servers, HTTPd's, etc. make decisions based on
	them.  The following are examples of country codes:</para>

      <title>Encoding</title>

      <para>Some languages (mostly Asian ones) use non-ASCII encodings
        that are 8-bit characters.  Older applications do not recognize
	them and mistake them for control characters.  Newer applications
	do recognize 8-bit characters.  Depending on implementation, users
	may be required to compile the application with 8-bit support
	(such as MySQL and Apache), or configure it correctly (such as
	telnet, ssh, and system shells).  To be able to input and process
	8-bit characters, the <ulink url="../ports/">FreeBSD Ports
	collection</ulink> has provided each language with different
	programs.  Refer to the i18n documentation in the respective
	FreeBSD Port.</para>

      <para>Specifically, the user needs to look at the application
	documentation to decide on how to configure it correctly or to
	pass correct values into the configure/Makefile/compiler.</para>

      <para>Some things to keep in mind are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

      <title>i18n applications</title>

      <para>In the FreeBSD Ports and Package system, i18n applications
	have been named with <literal>i18n</literal> in their names for
	easy identification.  However, they do not always support the
	language needed.</para>

      <para>Non-English users should install i18n libraries and
	applications if they wish to use a different locale.</para>

    <sect2 id="setting-locale">
      <title>Setting Locale</title>

      <para>Theoretically, one only needs to export the value of his/her
	language code as LANG in the login shell and is usually done
	through the user login shell configuration
	(<filename>.profile</filename>, <filename>.bashrc</filename>, or
	<filename>.cshrc</filename>).  This should set all of the locale
	subsets (such as <envar>LC_CTYPE</envar>,
	<envar>LC_CTIME</envar>, etc.).  However, some applications
	that do not follow the i18n convention correctly will require you
	to set each locale subset specifically.  Please refer to
	language-specific FreeBSD documentation for more
	information.</para>

      <para>You should set the following two values in your configuration
	files:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para><envar>LANG</envar> for POSIX &man.setlocale.3; family
	    functions</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para><envar>MM_CHARSET</envar> for applications' MIME character
	    set</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This includes the user shell config, the specific library
        config, and the X11 config.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Setting Locale - Shell Startup Files Method</title>

	<para> There are two methods for setting locale, and both are
	  described below.  The first is by adding environment variables
	  to the system's shell startup files, and the second is by <link
	  linkend="login-class">login class</link>.  To use th first
	  method, just set the two environment variables shown below in
	  the <filename>/etc/profile</filename> and/or
	  <filename>/etc/csh.login</filename> shell startup files.  We
	  will use the Russian language as an example below:</para>

	<para>In <filename>/etc/profile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>
<envar>LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R; export LANG</envar>
<envar>MM_CHARSET=KOI8-R; export MM_CHARSET</envar></programlisting>

	<para>Or in <filename>/etc/csh.login</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>
<envar>setenv LANG ru_RU.KOI8-R</envar>
<envar>setenv MM_CHARSET KOI8-R</envar></programlisting>

	<para>Alternatively, you can add the above instructions to
	  <filename>/usr/share/skel/dot.profile</filename> (similar to
	  what was used in <filename>/etc/profile</filename> above), or
	  <filename>/usr/share/skel/dot.login</filename> (similar to what
	  was used in <filename>/etc/csh.login</filename> above).</para>

	<para>For X11:</para>

	<para>In <filename>$HOME/.xinitrc</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>
<envar>LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R; export LANG</envar></programlisting>

	<para>Or:</para>

	<programlisting>
<envar>setenv LANG ru_RU.KOI8-R</envar></programlisting>

	<para>Depending on your shell (see above).</para>

	<para>In <filename>$HOME/.Xresources</filename>, you can set
	  application specific i18n settings (e.g., fonts, display
	  characters, etc.).</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="login-class">
        <title>Login Classes</title>

	<para>This method of setting locale should only be used when you
	  wish each user to be using the language you choose for your
	  system.  If you are a user or wish to allow users to default to
	  English and change locale themselves, please disregard this
	  section.</para>

	<para>Check that <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> have the
	  correct language user's class.  Make sure these settings appear
	  in <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>
<replaceable>language</replaceable>:<replaceable>Title for user accounts</replaceable>:\
	:charset=<replaceable>language charset</replaceable>:\
	:lang=<replaceable>country code.charset</replaceable>:\
	:tc=default:</programlisting>

	<para>So sticking with our previous example using Russian, it
	  would look like this:</para>
	
	<programlisting>
russian:Russian Users Accounts:\
	:charset=KOI8-R:\
	:lang=ru_RU.KOI8-R:\
	:tc=default:</programlisting>

	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Changing Login Classes with &man.adduser.8;</title>

	  <para>Use <command>adduser</command> to add new users, and do

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Set <programlisting>defaultclass = <replaceable>language</replaceable></programlisting>
		in <filename>/etc/adduser.conf</filename>.  Keep in mind

	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>An alternative variant is answering the specified

		class:</prompt> default []:</screen> appears from
		&man.adduser.8;</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Another alternative is to use the following for each
		user of a different language that you wish to add:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>adduser -class <replaceable>language</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Changing Login Classes with &man.pw.8;</title>

	  <para>If you use &man.pw.8; for adding new users, call it in
	    this form:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw useradd user_name -L <replaceable>language</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	</sect4>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="setting-console">
        <title>Console</title>

	<para>For all 7-bit Roman languages, set the correct console fonts
	  in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> for the language in
	  question with:</para>

	<programlisting>
font8x16=<replaceable>font name</replaceable>
font8x14=<replaceable>font name</replaceable>
font8x8=<replaceable>font name</replaceable></programlisting>

	<para>Also be sure to set the correct keymap and screenmap for
	  your 7-bit language through
	  <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>.  Once inside sysinstall,
	  choose <literal>Configure</literal>, then
	  <literal>Console</literal>.  Alternatively, you can add the

	<programlisting>
scrnmap=<replaceable>screenmap name</replaceable>
keychange=<replaceable>special key names</replaceable>
keymap=<replaceable>keymap name</replaceable></programlisting>

	<para>For 8-bit languages, use the correct FreeBSD Port in your
	  <filename>/usr/ports/<replaceable>language</replaceable></filename>
	  directory.  Some ports appear as console while the systems sees
	  it as serial vtty's, hence you must reserve enough vtty's for
	  both X11 and the pseudo-serial console.  Here is a partial list of

      <title>Compiling i18n Programs</title>

      <para>Many FreeBSD Ports have been ported with i18n support.  Some

	other programs have built in support for i18n and need no special

      <para>However, some applications such as MySQL need to be have the
	<filename>Makefile</filename> configured with the specific

      <title>Programming i18n Compliant Applications</title>

      <para>To make your application more useful for speakers of other
	languages, we hope that you will program i18n compliant.  The GNU
	gcc compiler, GUI Libraries like QT and GTK support i18n through
	special handling of strings.  Making a program i18n compliant is
	very easy.  It allows contributors to port your application to
	other languages quickly.  Refer to library specific i18n
	documentation for more details.</para>

      <para>To the contrary of common perception, i18n compliant code is
	easy to write.  Usually, it only involves wrapping your strings
	with library specific functions.  In addition, please be sure to
	allow for 8-bit character support.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>A Call to Unify the i18n effort</title>

	<para>It has come to our attention that the individual i18n/l10n
	  efforts for each country has been repeating each others'
	  efforts.  Many of us have been reinventing the wheel repeatedly
	  and inefficiently.  We hope that the various major groups in
	  i18n could congregate into a group effort similiar to the Core
	  Team's responsibility.</para>

	<para>Currently, we hope that, when you write or port i18n
	  programs, you would send it out to each country's related
	  FreeBSD mailing lists for testing.  In the future, we hope to
	  create applications that work in all the languages
	  out-of-the-box without dirty hacks.</para>

	<title>Perl and Python</title>

	<para>Perl and Python have i18n and 8-bit character handling
	  libraries.  Please use them for i18n compliance.</para>

	<para>Occasionally, Perl gives warning about not having a locale
	  that is already installed in your system.  You can set the

    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>This chapter will provide an explanation of what &os; jails
      are and how to use them.  Jails, sometimes referred to as an
      enhanced replacement of <emphasis>chroot environments</emphasis>,
      are a very powerful tool for system administrators, but their basic
      usage can also be useful for advanced users.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Since system administration is a difficult and perplexing
      task, many powerful tools were developed to make life easier for
      the administrator.  These tools mostly provide enhancements of some sort
      to the way systems are installed, configured and maintained.
      Part of the tasks which an administrator is
      expected to do is to properly configure the security of a system,
      so that it can continue serving its real purpose, without allowing
      security violations.</para>

    <para>One of the tools which can be used to enhance the security of
      a &os; system are <emphasis>jails</emphasis>.  Jails were
      introduced in &os;-4.X by &a.phk;, but were greatly improved in
      &os;-5.X to make them a powerful and flexible subsystem.  Their
      development still goes on, enhancing their usefulness, performance, reliability,
      and security.</para>

    <sect2 id="jails-what">
      <title>What is a Jail</title>

      <para>BSD-like operating systems have had &man.chroot.2; since the
	time of 4.2BSD.  The &man.chroot.8; utility can be used to
	change the root directory
	of a set of processes, creating a safe environment, separate
	from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted
	environment can not access files or resources outside of it.
	For that reason, compromising a service running in a chrooted
	environment should not allow the attacker to compromise the
	entire system.  The &man.chroot.8; utility is good for easy
	tasks, which do not require a lot of flexibility or complex and
	advanced features.  Since the inception of the
	chroot concept, however, many ways have been found to escape from a
	chrooted environment and, although they have been fixed in
	modern versions of the &os; kernel, it was clear that
	&man.chroot.2; was not the ideal solution for securing services.
	A new subsystem had to be implemented.</para>

      <para>This is one of the main reasons why
	<emphasis>jails</emphasis> were developed.</para>

      <para>Jails improve on the concept of the traditional
	&man.chroot.2; environment, in several ways.  In a traditional
	&man.chroot.2; environment, processes are only limited in the
	part of the file system they can access.  The rest of the system
	resources (like the set of system users, the running processes,
	or the networking subsystem) are shared by the chrooted
	processes and the processes of the host system.  Jails expand
	this model by virtualizing not only access to the file system,
	but also the set of users, the networking subsystem of the &os;
	kernel and a few other things.  A more complete set of
	fine-grained controls available for tuning the access of a
	jailed environment is described in <xref
	  linkend="jails-tuning">.</para>

      <para>A jail is characterized by four elements:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A directory subtree &mdash; the starting point from
	    which a jail is entered.  Once inside the jail, a process
	    is not permitted to escape outside of this subtree.
	    Traditional security issues which plagued the original
	    &man.chroot.2; design will not affect &os; jails.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A hostname &mdash; the hostname which will be used
	    within the jail.  Jails are mainly used for hosting network
	    services, therefore having a descriptive hostname for each
	    jail can really help the system administrator.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>An <acronym>IP</acronym> address &mdash; this will be
	    assigned to the jail and cannot be changed in any way during
	    the jail's life span.  The IP address of a jail is usually an alias address
	    for an existing network interface, but this is not strictly necessary.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A command &mdash; the path name of an executable to run
	    inside the jail.  This is relative to the root directory of
	    the jail environment, and may vary a lot, depending on the
	    type of the specific jail environment.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Apart from these, jails can have their own set of users and
	their own <username>root</username> user.  Naturally, the powers
	of the <username>root</username> user are limited within the
	jail environment and, from the point of view of the host system,
	the jail <username>root</username> user is not an omnipotent user.
	In addition, the <username>root</username> user of a jail is not
	allowed to perform critical operations to the system outside of
	the associated &man.jail.8; environment.  More information
	about capabilities and restrictions of the
	<username>root</username> user will be discussed in <xref
	  linkend="jails-tuning"> below.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="jails-build">
    <title>Creating, and Controlling the jail</title>

    <para>Some administrators divide jails into the following two types:
      <quote>complete</quote> jails, which resemble a real &os; system,
      and <quote>service</quote> jails, dedicated to one application or
      service, possibly running with privileges.  This is only a
      conceptual division and the process of building a jail is not
      affected by it.  The &man.jail.8; manual page is quite clear about
      the procedure for building a jail:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>setenv D <replaceable>/here/is/the/jail</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p $D</userinput> <co id="jailpath">
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make world DESTDIR=$D</userinput> <co id="jailworld">
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd etc/</userinput> <footnote><para>This step
is not required on &os; 6.0 and later.</para></footnote>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make distribution DESTDIR=$D</userinput> <co id="jaildistrib">
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount_devfs devfs $D/dev</userinput> <co id="jaildevfs"></screen>

    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="jailpath">
	<para>Selecting a location for a jail is the best starting point.
	  This is where the jail will physically reside within the file system of the jail's host.
	  A good choice can be <filename
	    role="directory">/usr/jail/<replaceable>jailname</replaceable></filename>,
	  where <replaceable>jailname</replaceable> is the hostname
	  identifying the jail.  The <filename
	    role="directory">/usr/</filename> file system usually has
	  enough space for the jail file system, which for <quote>complete</quote> jails is, essentially,
	  a replication of every file present in a default installation
	  of the &os; base system.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="jailworld">
	<para>This command will populate the directory subtree chosen
	  as jail's physical location on the file system with the
	  necessary binaries, libraries, manual pages and so on.
	  Everything is done in the typical &os; style &mdash; first
	  everything is built/compiled, then installed to the
	  destination path.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="jaildistrib">
	<para>The <maketarget>distribution</maketarget> target for
	  <application>make</application> installs every needed
	  configuration file.  In simple words, it installs every installable file of
	  <filename role="directory">/usr/src/etc/</filename> to the
	  <filename role="directory">/etc</filename> directory of the jail
	  environment:
	  <filename role="directory">$D/etc/</filename>.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="jaildevfs">
	<para>Mounting the &man.devfs.8; file system inside a jail is
	  not required.  On the other hand, any, or almost any
	  application requires access to at least one device, depending
	  on the purpose of the given application.  It is very important
	  to control access to devices from inside a jail, as improper
	  settings could permit an attacker to do nasty things in the
	  jail.  Control over &man.devfs.8; is managed through rulesets
	  which are described in the &man.devfs.8; and
	  &man.devfs.conf.5; manual pages.</para>
      </callout>
    </calloutlist>

    <para>Once a jail is installed, it can be started by using the
      &man.jail.8; utility.  The  &man.jail.8; utility takes four
      mandatory arguments which are described in the <xref
	linkend="jails-what"> section.  Other arguments may be
      specified too, i.e.&nbsp;to run the jailed process with the credentials of a specific
      user.  The <command>command</command> argument depends on
      the type of the jail; for a <emphasis>virtual system</emphasis>,
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> is a good choice, since it will
      replicate the startup sequence of a real &os; system.  For a
      <emphasis>service</emphasis> jail, it depends on the service or
      application that will run within the jail.</para>

    <para>Jails are often started at boot time and the &os;
      <filename>rc</filename> mechanism provides an easy way to do
      this.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>A list of the jails which are enabled to start at boot
	  time should be added to the &man.rc.conf.5; file:</para>

	<programlisting>jail_enable="YES"   # Set to NO to disable starting of any jails
jail_list="<replaceable>www</replaceable>"     # Space separated list of names of jails</programlisting>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>For each jail listed in <varname>jail_list</varname>, a
	  group of &man.rc.conf.5; settings, which describe the
	  particular jail, should be added:</para>

	<programlisting>jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_rootdir="/usr/jail/www"     # jail's root directory
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_hostname="<replaceable>www</replaceable>.example.org"  # jail's hostname
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_ip="192.168.0.10"           # jail's IP address
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_devfs_enable="YES"          # mount devfs in the jail
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_devfs_ruleset="<replaceable>www_ruleset</replaceable>" # devfs ruleset to apply to jail</programlisting>

	<para>The default startup of jails configured in
	  &man.rc.conf.5;, will run the <filename>/etc/rc</filename>
	  script of the jail, which assumes the jail is a complete
	  virtual system.  For service jails, the default startup
	  command of the jail should be changed, by setting the
	  <varname>jail_<replaceable>jailname</replaceable>_exec_start</varname>
	  option appropriately.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>For a full list of available options, please see the
	    &man.rc.conf.5; manual page.</para>
	</note>
    </procedure>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/rc.d/jail</filename> script can be used to
      start or stop a jail by hand, if an entry for it exists in
      <filename>rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/jail start <replaceable>www</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/jail stop <replaceable>www</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>A clean way to shut down a &man.jail.8; is not available at
      the moment.  This is because commands normally used to accomplish
      a clean system shutdown cannot be used inside a jail.  The best
      way to shut down a jail is to run the following command from
      within the jail itself or using the &man.jexec.8; utility from
      outside the jail:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh /etc/rc.shutdown</userinput></screen>

    <para>More information about this can be found in the &man.jail.8;
      manual page.</para>

    <para>There are several options which can be set for any jail, and

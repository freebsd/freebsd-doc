    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>This chapter will provide an explanation of what &os; jails
      are and how to use them.  Jails, sometimes referred to as an
      enhanced replacement of <emphasis>chroot environments</emphasis>,
      are a very powerful tool for system administrators, but their basic
      usage can also be useful for advanced users.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Since system administration is a difficult and perplexing
      task, many powerful tools were developed to make life easier for
      the administrator.  These tools mostly provide enhancements of some sort
      to the way systems are installed, configured and maintained.
      Part of the tasks which an administrator is
      expected to do is to properly configure the security of a system,
      so that it can continue serving its real purpose, without allowing
      security violations.</para>

    <para>One of the tools which can be used to enhance the security of
      a &os; system are <emphasis>jails</emphasis>.  Jails were
      introduced in &os;&nbsp;4.X by &a.phk;, but were greatly improved in
      &os;&nbsp;5.X to make them a powerful and flexible subsystem.  Their
      development still goes on, enhancing their usefulness, performance, reliability,
      and security.</para>

    <sect2 id="jails-what">
      <title>What is a Jail</title>

      <para>BSD-like operating systems have had &man.chroot.2; since the
	time of 4.2BSD.  The &man.chroot.8; utility can be used to
	change the root directory
	of a set of processes, creating a safe environment, separate
	from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted
	environment can not access files or resources outside of it.
	For that reason, compromising a service running in a chrooted
	environment should not allow the attacker to compromise the
	entire system.  The &man.chroot.8; utility is good for easy
	tasks, which do not require a lot of flexibility or complex and
	advanced features.  Since the inception of the
	chroot concept, however, many ways have been found to escape from a
	chrooted environment and, although they have been fixed in
	modern versions of the &os; kernel, it was clear that
	&man.chroot.2; was not the ideal solution for securing services.
	A new subsystem had to be implemented.</para>

      <para>This is one of the main reasons why
	<emphasis>jails</emphasis> were developed.</para>

      <para>Jails improve on the concept of the traditional
	&man.chroot.2; environment, in several ways.  In a traditional
	&man.chroot.2; environment, processes are only limited in the
	part of the file system they can access.  The rest of the system
	resources (like the set of system users, the running processes,
	or the networking subsystem) are shared by the chrooted
	processes and the processes of the host system.  Jails expand
	this model by virtualizing not only access to the file system,
	but also the set of users, the networking subsystem of the &os;
	kernel and a few other things.  A more complete set of
	fine-grained controls available for tuning the access of a
	jailed environment is described in <xref
	  linkend="jails-tuning">.</para>

      <para>A jail is characterized by four elements:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A directory subtree &mdash; the starting point from
	    which a jail is entered.  Once inside the jail, a process
	    is not permitted to escape outside of this subtree.
	    Traditional security issues which plagued the original
	    &man.chroot.2; design will not affect &os; jails.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A hostname &mdash; the hostname which will be used
	    within the jail.  Jails are mainly used for hosting network
	    services, therefore having a descriptive hostname for each
	    jail can really help the system administrator.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>An <acronym>IP</acronym> address &mdash; this will be
	    assigned to the jail and cannot be changed in any way during
	    the jail's life span.  The IP address of a jail is usually an alias address
	    for an existing network interface, but this is not strictly necessary.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A command &mdash; the path name of an executable to run
	    inside the jail.  This is relative to the root directory of
	    the jail environment, and may vary a lot, depending on the
	    type of the specific jail environment.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Apart from these, jails can have their own set of users and
	their own <username>root</username> user.  Naturally, the powers
	of the <username>root</username> user are limited within the
	jail environment and, from the point of view of the host system,
	the jail <username>root</username> user is not an omnipotent user.
	In addition, the <username>root</username> user of a jail is not
	allowed to perform critical operations to the system outside of
	the associated &man.jail.8; environment.  More information
	about capabilities and restrictions of the
	<username>root</username> user will be discussed in <xref
	  linkend="jails-tuning"> below.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="jails-build">
    <title>Creating and Controlling Jails</title>

    <para>Some administrators divide jails into the following two types:
      <quote>complete</quote> jails, which resemble a real &os; system,
      and <quote>service</quote> jails, dedicated to one application or
      service, possibly running with privileges.  This is only a
      conceptual division and the process of building a jail is not
      affected by it.  The &man.jail.8; manual page is quite clear about
      the procedure for building a jail:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>setenv D <replaceable>/here/is/the/jail</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p -m 0700 $D</userinput> <co id="jailpath"> <co id="chmod">

&prompt.root; <userinput>make distribution DESTDIR=$D</userinput> <co id="jaildistrib">

    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="jailpath">
	<para>Selecting a location for a jail is the best starting point.
	  This is where the jail will physically reside within the file system of the jail's host.
	  A good choice can be <filename

	  where <replaceable>jailname</replaceable> is the hostname
	  identifying the jail.  The <filename
	    class="directory">/usr/</filename> file system usually has
	  enough space for the jail file system, which for <quote>complete</quote> jails is, essentially,
	  a replication of every file present in a default installation
	  of the &os; base system.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="chmod">
	<para>It is important to restrict access to the jail from the host

	  are not usable in the host system; otherwise an attacker with root
	  access to the jail could create a setuid program in the jail and
	  execute it in the host.  For similar reasons it is a bad idea to

      <callout arearefs="jaildevfs">
	<para>Mounting the &man.devfs.8; file system inside a jail is
	  not required.  On the other hand, any, or almost any
	  application requires access to at least one device, depending
	  on the purpose of the given application.  It is very important
	  to control access to devices from inside a jail, as improper
	  settings could permit an attacker to do nasty things in the
	  jail.  Control over &man.devfs.8; is managed through rulesets
	  which are described in the &man.devfs.8; and
	  &man.devfs.conf.5; manual pages.</para>
      </callout>
    </calloutlist>

    <para>Once a jail is installed, it can be started by using the
      &man.jail.8; utility.  The  &man.jail.8; utility takes four
      mandatory arguments which are described in the <xref
	linkend="jails-what">.  Other arguments may be
      specified too, e.g., to run the jailed process with the credentials of a specific
      user.  The <option><replaceable>command</replaceable></option> argument depends on
      the type of the jail; for a <emphasis>virtual system</emphasis>,
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> is a good choice, since it will
      replicate the startup sequence of a real &os; system.  For a
      <emphasis>service</emphasis> jail, it depends on the service or
      application that will run within the jail.</para>

    <para>Jails are often started at boot time and the &os;
      <filename>rc</filename> mechanism provides an easy way to do
      this.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>A list of the jails which are enabled to start at boot
	  time should be added to the &man.rc.conf.5; file:</para>

	<programlisting>jail_enable="YES"   # Set to NO to disable starting of any jails
jail_list="<replaceable>www</replaceable>"     # Space separated list of names of jails</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>Jail names in <varname>jail_list</varname> should
	    contain alphanumeric characters only.</para>
	</note>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>For each jail listed in <varname>jail_list</varname>, a
	  group of &man.rc.conf.5; settings, which describe the
	  particular jail, should be added:</para>

	<programlisting>jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_rootdir="/usr/jail/www"     # jail's root directory
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_hostname="<replaceable>www</replaceable>.example.org"  # jail's hostname
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_ip="192.168.0.10"           # jail's IP address
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_devfs_enable="YES"          # mount devfs in the jail
jail_<replaceable>www</replaceable>_devfs_ruleset="<replaceable>www_ruleset</replaceable>" # devfs ruleset to apply to jail</programlisting>

	<para>The default startup of jails configured in
	  &man.rc.conf.5;, will run the <filename>/etc/rc</filename>
	  script of the jail, which assumes the jail is a complete
	  virtual system.  For service jails, the default startup
	  command of the jail should be changed, by setting the
	  <varname>jail_<replaceable>jailname</replaceable>_exec_start</varname>
	  option appropriately.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>For a full list of available options, please see the
	    &man.rc.conf.5; manual page.</para>
	</note>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/rc.d/jail</filename> script can be used to
      start or stop a jail by hand, if an entry for it exists in
      <filename>rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/jail start <replaceable>www</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/jail stop <replaceable>www</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>A clean way to shut down a &man.jail.8; is not available at
      the moment.  This is because commands normally used to accomplish
      a clean system shutdown cannot be used inside a jail.  The best
      way to shut down a jail is to run the following command from
      within the jail itself or using the &man.jexec.8; utility from
      outside the jail:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh /etc/rc.shutdown</userinput></screen>

    <para>More information about this can be found in the &man.jail.8;
      manual page.</para>

      <title>Service Jails</title>

      <para>This section is based upon an idea originally presented by
	&a.simon; at <ulink
	url="http://simon.nitro.dk/service-jails.html"></ulink>, and an
	updated article written by Ken Tom
	<email>locals@gmail.com</email>.  This section illustrates how
	to set up a &os; system that adds an additional layer of
	security, using the &man.jail.8; feature.  It is also assumed
	that the given system is at least running RELENG_6_0 and the
	information provided earlier in this chapter has been well
	understood.</para>

      <sect3 id="jails-service-jails-design">
       <title>Design</title>

	<para>One of the major problems with jails is the management of
	  their upgrade process.  This tends to be a problem because
	  every jail has to be rebuilt from scratch whenever it is
	  updated.  This is usually not a problem for a single jail,
	  since the update process is fairly simple, but can be quite
	  time consuming and tedious if a lot of jails are
	  created.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>This setup requires advanced experience with &os; and
	    usage of its features.  If the presented steps below look
	    too complicated, it is advised to take a look at a simpler
	    system such as <filename
	      role="package">sysutils/ezjail</filename>, which provides
	    an easier method of administering &os; jails and is not as
	    sophisticated as this setup.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>This idea has been presented to resolve such issues by
	  sharing as much as is possible between jails, in a safe way
	  &mdash; using read-only &man.mount.nullfs.8; mounts, so that
	  updating will be be simpler, and putting single services into
	  individual jails will become more attractive.  Additionally,
	  it provides a simple way to add or remove jails as well as a
	  way to upgrade them.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Examples of services in this context are: an
	  <acronym>HTTP</acronym> server, a <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	  server, a <acronym>SMTP</acronym> server, and so forth.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The goals of the setup described in this section 
	  are:</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Create a simple and easy to understand jail structure.

	<para>As it has been already mentioned, this design relies

	<title>Creating the Template</title>

	<para>This section will describe the steps needed to create the
	  master template that will be the read-only portion for the
	  jails to use.<para>

	<para>It is always a good idea to update the &os; system to the
	  latest -RELEASE branch.  Check the corresponding Handbook
	  <ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/makeworld.html">Chapter</ulink>
	  to accomplish this task.  In the case the update is not
	  feasible, the buildworld will be required in order to be able
	  to proceed.  Additionally, the <filename
	    role="package">sysutils/cpdup</filename> package will be
	  required.  We will use the &man.portsnap.8; utility to
	  download the &os; Ports Collection.  The Handbook <ulink
	    url="&url.books.handbook;/portsnap.html">Portsnap Chapter</ulink>
	  is always good reading for newcomers.</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>First, create a directory structure for the read-only
	      file system which will contain the &os; binaries for our
	      jails, then change directory to the &os; source tree and
	      install the read-only file system to the jail
	      template:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -m 0700 /home/j && mkdir /home/j/mroot</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installworld DESTDIR=/home/j/mroot</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>Next, prepare a &os; Ports Collection for the jails as
	      well as a &os; source tree, which is required for
	      <application>mergemaster</application>:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /home/j/mroot</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir usr/ports</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>portsnap -p /home/j/mroot/usr/ports fetch extract</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cpdup /usr/src /home/j/mroot/usr/src</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>Create a skeleton for the read-write portion of the
	      system:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /home/j/skel /home/j/skel/home /home/j/skel/usr-X11R6 /home/j/skel/distfiles</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv etc /home/j/skel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv usr/local /home/j/skel/usr-local</userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>mv var /home/j/skel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv root /home/j/skel</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>Use <application>mergemaster</application> to install
	      missing configuration files.  Then get rid of the extra
	      directories that <application>mergemaster</application>
	      creates:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mergemaster -t /home/j/skel/var/tmp/temproot -D /home/j/skel -i</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /home/j/skel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>rm -R bin boot lib libexec mnt proc rescue sbin sys usr dev</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>Now, symlink the read-write file system to the
	      read-only file system.  Please make sure that the symlinks
	      are created in the correct <filename
		class="directory">s/</filename> locations.  Real
	      directories or the creation of directories in the wrong
	      locations will cause the installation to  fail.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /home/j/mroot</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir s</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s s/etc etc</userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s s/var var</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>As a last step, create a generic

	      contents as shown below:</para>

	      <programlisting>WRKDIRPREFIX?=  /s/portbuild</programlisting>


	      <para>Having <literal>WRKDIRPREFIX</literal> set up this
	      way will make it possible to compile &os; ports inside
	      each jail.  Remember that the ports directory is part of
	      the read-only system.  The custom path for
	      <literal>WRKDIRPREFIX</literal> allows builds to be done
	      in the read-write portion of every jail.</para>

	</procedure>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="jails-service-jails-creating">
	<title>Creating Jails</title>

	<para>Now that we have a complete &os; jail template, we can
	  setup and configure the jails in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This example demonstrates
	  the creation of 3 jails: <quote>NS</quote>,
	  <quote>MAIL</quote> and <quote>WWW</quote>.<para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>Put the following lines into the

	    <note>
	      <para>Partitions marked with a 0 pass number are not

		<varname>jail_<replaceable>name</replaceable>_rootdir</varname>
		variable must <emphasis>not</emphasis> be set to a path
		which includes a symbolic link, otherwise the jails will
		refuse to start.  Use the &man.realpath.1; utility to

	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <para>In this phase, the jails are built and prepared to

	<para>The jails should be running now.  To check if they have

	<para>At this point, it should be possible to log onto each
	  jail, add new users or configure daemons.  The

	<title>Upgrading</title>

	<para>In time, there will be a need to upgrade the system to a

	  easy way to upgrade existing jails.  Additionally, it
	  minimizes their downtime, as the jails will be brought down

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>The first step is to upgrade the host system in the

    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>Since system administration is a difficult task, many tools
      have been developed to make life easier for the administrator.
      These tools often enhance the way systems are installed,
      configured, and maintained.  One of the tools which can be used
      to enhance the security of a &os; system is
      <firstterm>jails</firstterm>.  Jails have been available since
      &os;&nbsp;4.X and continue to be enhanced in their usefulness,
      performance, reliability, and security.</para>

    <para>Jails build upon the &man.chroot.2; concept, which is used
      to change the root directory of a set of processes, creating a
      safe environment, separate from the rest of the system.
      Processes created in the chrooted environment can not access
      files or resources outside of it.  For that reason, compromising
      a service running in a chrooted environment should not allow the
      attacker to compromise the entire system.  However, a chroot has
      several limitations.  It is suited to easy tasks which do not
      require much flexibility or complex, advanced features.  Over
      time many ways have been found to escape from a chrooted
      environment, making it a less than ideal solution for securing
      services.</para>

    <para>Jails improve on the concept of the traditional chroot
      environment in several ways.  In a traditional chroot
      environment, processes are only limited in the part of the file
      system they can access.  The rest of the system resources,
      system users, running processes, and the networking subsystem
      are shared by the chrooted processes and the processes of the
      host system.  Jails expand this model by virtualizing access to
      the file system, the set of users, and the networking subsystem.
      More fine-grained controls are available for tuning the access
      of a jailed environment.  Jails can be considered as a type of
      operating system-level virtualization.</para>

    <para>A jail is characterized by four elements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>A directory subtree: the starting point from which a
	  jail is entered.  Once inside the jail, a process is not
	  permitted to escape outside of this subtree.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A hostname: which will be used by the jail.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>An <acronym>IP</acronym> address: which is assigned to
	  the jail.  The <acronym>IP</acronym> address of a jail is
	  often an alias address for an existing network
	  interface.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A command: the path name of an executable to run inside
	  the jail.  The path is relative to the root directory of the
	  jail environment.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Jails have their own set of users and their own <systemitem
	class="username">root</systemitem> account which are limited
      to the jail environment.  The <systemitem
	class="username">root</systemitem> account of a jail is not
      allowed to perform operations to the system outside of the
      associated jail environment.</para>

    <para>This chapter provides an overview of jail terminology are
      how to use &os; jails.  Jails are a powerful tool for system
      administrators, but their basic usage can also be useful for
      advanced users.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>What a jail is and what purpose it may serve in &os;
	  installations.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>How to build, start, and stop a jail.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The basics of jail administration, both from inside and
	  outside the jail.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <important>
      <para>Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security
	panacea.  While it is not possible for a jailed process to
	break out on its own, there are several ways in which an
	unprivileged user outside the jail can cooperate with a
	privileged user inside the jail to obtain elevated privileges
	in the host environment.</para>

      <para>Most of these attacks can be mitigated by ensuring that
	the jail root is not accessible to unprivileged users in the
	host environment.  As a general rule, untrusted users with
	privileged access to a jail should not be given access to the
	host environment.</para>

    <title>Creating and Controlling Jails</title>

    <para>Some administrators divide jails into the following two
      types: <quote>complete</quote> jails, which resemble a real &os;
      system, and <quote>service</quote> jails, dedicated to one
      application or service, possibly running with privileges.  This
      is only a conceptual division and the process of building a jail
      is not affected by it.  When creating a <quote>complete</quote>
      jail there are two options for the source of the userland: use
      prebuilt binaries (such as those supplied on an install media)
      or build from source.</para>

    <para>To install the userland from installation media, first
      create the root directory for the jail.  This can be done by
      setting the <varname>DESTDIR</varname> variable to the proper
      location.</para>

    <para>Start a shell and define <varname>DESTDIR</varname>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>export DESTDIR=<replaceable>/here/is/the/jail</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Mount the install media as covered in &man.mdconfig.8;
      when using the install ISO:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/`mdconfig -f cdimage.iso` /mnt</userinput></screen>

    <para>Extract the binaries from the tarballs on the install media
      into the declared destination.  Minimally, only the base set
      needs to be extracted, but a complete install can be performed
      when preferred.</para>

    <para>To install just the base system, run the next command when
      using &os;&nbsp;9.x or newer:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>tar -xf /mnt/usr/freebsd_dist/base.txz -C $DESTDIR</userinput></screen>

    <para>On &os; 8.x systems, use this command instead:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/mnt/8.<replaceable>4</replaceable>-RELEASE/base/install.sh</userinput></screen>

    <para>To install everything except the kernel, issue one of these
      commands:</para>

    <para>When using &os;&nbsp;9.x and newer:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>for <replaceable>sets</replaceable> in BASE PORTS; do tar -xf /mnt/FREEBSD_INSTALL/USR/FREEBSD_DIST/$<replaceable>sets</replaceable>.TXZ -C $DESTDIR ; done</userinput></screen>

    <para>When using &os;&nbsp;8.x:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt/8.<replaceable>4</replaceable>-RELEASE; for <replaceable>dir</replaceable> in base catpages dict doc games info manpages ports; do (cd $<replaceable>dir</replaceable>; ./install.sh) ; done</userinput></screen>

    <para>The &man.jail.8; manual page explains the procedure for
      building a jail:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>setenv D <replaceable>/here/is/the/jail</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p $D</userinput>      <co xml:id="jailpath"/>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildworld</userinput>  <co xml:id="jailbuildworld"/>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installworld DESTDIR=$D</userinput>  <co xml:id="jailinstallworld"/>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make distribution DESTDIR=$D</userinput>  <co xml:id="jaildistrib"/>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t devfs devfs $D/dev</userinput>   <co xml:id="jaildevfs"/></screen>

      <callout arearefs="jailpath">
	<para>Selecting a location for a jail is the best starting
	  point.  This is where the jail will physically reside within

	  where <replaceable>jailname</replaceable> is the hostname
	  identifying the jail.  Usually, <filename>/usr/</filename>

	  very important to control access to devices from inside a
	  jail, as improper settings could permit an attacker to do
	  nasty things in the jail.  Control over &man.devfs.8; is
	  managed through rulesets which are described in the
	  &man.devfs.8; and &man.devfs.conf.5; manual pages.</para>

    </calloutlist>

    <para>Once a jail is installed, it can be started by using the
      &man.jail.8; utility.  The &man.jail.8; utility takes four
      mandatory arguments which are described in the <xref
	linkend="jails-synopsis"/>.  Other arguments may be specified
      too, e.g., to run the jailed process with the credentials of a
      specific user.  The
      <option><replaceable>command</replaceable></option> argument
      depends on the type of the jail; for a
      <emphasis>virtual system</emphasis>,
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> is a good choice, since it will
      replicate the startup sequence of a real &os; system.  For a
      <emphasis>service</emphasis> jail, it depends on the service or
      application that will run within the jail.</para>

    <para>Jails are often started at boot time and the &os;
      <filename>rc</filename> mechanism provides an easy way to do
      this.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>A list of the jails which are enabled to start at boot

	    contain alphanumeric characters only.</para>
	</note>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>For each jail listed in <varname>jail_list</varname>, a
	  group of &man.rc.conf.5; settings, which describe the
	  particular jail, should be added:</para>

	<para>The default startup of jails configured in
	  &man.rc.conf.5;, will run the <filename>/etc/rc</filename>
	  script of the jail, which assumes the jail is a complete

    <para>The management of multiple jails can become problematic
      because every jail has to be rebuilt from scratch whenever it is
      upgraded.  This can be time consuming and tedious if a lot of
      jails are created and manually updated.</para>

    <para>This section demonstrates one method to resolve this issue
      by safely sharing as much as is possible between jails using
      read-only &man.mount.nullfs.8; mounts, so that updating is
      simpler.  This makes it more attractive to put single services,
      such as <acronym>HTTP</acronym>, <acronym>DNS</acronym>, and
      <acronym>SMTP</acronym>, into individual jails.  Additionally,
      it provides a simple way to add, remove, and upgrade
      jails.</para>

      <title>Creating the Template</title>

      <para>This section describes the steps needed to create the
	master template.</para>

      <para>It is recommended to first update the host &os; system to
	the latest -RELEASE branch using the instructions in <xref
	  linkend="makeworld"/>.  Additionally, this template uses the
	<package>sysutils/cpdup</package> package or port and
	<application>portsnap</application> will be used to download
	the &os; Ports Collection.</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>First, create a directory structure for the read-only
	    file system which will contain the &os; binaries for the
	    jails.  Then, change directory to the &os; source tree and
	    install the read-only file system to the jail
	    template:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /home/j /home/j/mroot</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installworld DESTDIR=/home/j/mroot</userinput></screen>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Next, prepare a &os; Ports Collection for the jails as
	    well as a &os; source tree, which is required for
	    <application>mergemaster</application>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /home/j/mroot</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir usr/ports</userinput>

	<step>
	  <para>Create a skeleton for the read-write portion of the

	<step>
	  <para>Use <application>mergemaster</application> to install

	  <para>Now, symlink the read-write file system to the
	    read-only file system.  Ensure that the symlinks are
	    created in the correct <filename>s/</filename> locations
	    as the creation of directories in the wrong locations will

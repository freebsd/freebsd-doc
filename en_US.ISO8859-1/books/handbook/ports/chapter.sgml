    <para>FreeBSD is bundled with a rich collection of system tools as
      part of the base system.  However, there is only so much one can
      do before needing to install an additional third-party
      application to get real work done.  FreeBSD provides two
      complementary technologies for installing third-party software
      on your system: the FreeBSD Ports Collection (for installing from
      source), and packages (for installing from pre-built binaries).
      Either method may be used to install the
      newest version of your favorite applications from local media or
      straight off the network.</para>

    <title>Overview of Software Installation</title>

    <para>If you have used a &unix; system before you will know that
      the typical procedure for installing third-party software goes
      something like this:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Download the software, which might be distributed in
	  source code format, or as a binary.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Unpack the software from its distribution format
	  (typically a tarball compressed with &man.compress.1;,
	  &man.gzip.1;, or &man.bzip2.1;).</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Locate the documentation (perhaps an
	  <filename>INSTALL</filename> or <filename>README</filename>
	  file, or some files in a <filename>doc/</filename>
	  subdirectory) and read up on how to install the
	  software.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>If the software was distributed in source format,
	  compile it.  This may involve editing a
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>, or running a
	  <command>configure</command> script, and other work.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Test and install the software.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>And that is only if everything goes well.  If you are
      installing a software package that was not deliberately ported
      to FreeBSD you may even have to go in and edit the code to make
      it work properly.</para>

    <para>Should you want to, you can continue to install software the
      <quote>traditional</quote> way with FreeBSD.  However, FreeBSD
      provides two technologies which can save you a lot of effort:
      packages and ports.  At the time of writing, over &os.numports;
      third-party applications have been made available in this
      way.</para>

    <para>For any given application, the FreeBSD package for that
      application is a single file which you must download.  The
      package contains pre-compiled copies of all the commands for the
      application, as well as any configuration files or
      documentation.  A downloaded package file can be manipulated
      with FreeBSD package management commands, such as
      &man.pkg.add.1;, &man.pkg.delete.1;, &man.pkg.info.1;, and so
      on.  Installing a new application can be carried out with a
      single command.</para>

    <para>A FreeBSD port for an application is a collection of files
      designed to automate the process of compiling an application
      from source code.</para>

    <para>Remember that there are a number of steps you would normally
      carry out if you compiled a program yourself (downloading,
      unpacking, patching, compiling, installing).  The files that
      make up a port contain all the necessary information to allow
      the system to do this for you.  You run a handful of simple
      commands and the source code for the application is
      automatically downloaded, extracted, patched, compiled, and
      installed for you.</para>

    <para>In fact, the ports system can also be used to generate packages
      which can later be manipulated with <command>pkg_add</command>
      and the other package management commands that will be introduced
      shortly.</para>

    <para>Both packages and ports understand
      <emphasis>dependencies</emphasis>.  Suppose you want to install
      an application that depends on a specific library being
      installed.  Both the application and the library have been made
      available as FreeBSD ports and packages.  If you use the
      <command>pkg_add</command> command or the ports system to add
      the application, both will notice that the library has not been
      installed, and automatically install the library first.</para>

    <para>Given that the two technologies are quite similar, you might
      be wondering why FreeBSD bothers with both.  Packages and ports
      both have their own strengths, and which one you use will depend
      on your own preference.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Package Benefits</title>

      <listitem>
	<para>A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than
	  the compressed tarball containing the source code for the
	  application.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require any additional compilation.  For
	  large applications, such as
	  <application>Mozilla</application>,
	  <application>KDE</application>, or
	  <application>GNOME</application> this can be important,
	  particularly if you are on a slow system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require any understanding of the process
	  involved in compiling software on FreeBSD.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Ports Benefits</title>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages are normally compiled with conservative options,
	  because they have to run on the maximum number of systems.  By
	  installing from the port, you can tweak the compilation options to
	  (for example) generate code that is specific to a Pentium
	  4 or Athlon processor.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some applications have compile-time options relating to
	  what they can and cannot do.  For example,
	  <application>Apache</application> can be configured with a
	  wide variety of different built-in options.  By building
	  from the port you do not have to accept the default options,
	  and can set them yourself.</para>

	<para>In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same
	  application to specify certain settings.  For example,
	  <application>Ghostscript</application> is available as a
	  <filename>ghostscript</filename> package and a
	  <filename>ghostscript-nox11</filename> package, depending on
	  whether or not you have installed an X11 server.  This sort
	  of rough tweaking is possible with packages, but rapidly
	  becomes impossible if an application has more than one or
	  two different compile-time options.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The licensing conditions of some software distributions forbid
	  binary distribution.  They must be distributed as source
	  code.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some people do not trust binary distributions.  At least
	  with source code, you can (in theory) read through it and
	  look for potential problems yourself.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you have local patches, you will need the source in order to
	  apply them.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some people like having code around, so they can read it
	  if they get bored, hack it, borrow from it (license
	  permitting, of course), and so on.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To keep track of updated ports, subscribe to the
      &a.ports; and the &a.ports-bugs;.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Before installing any application, you should check <ulink
	url="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/"></ulink> for security issues
	related to your application.</para>

      <para>You can also install <filename
	role="package">ports-mgmt/portaudit</filename> which will
	automatically check all installed applications for known
	vulnerabilities; a check will be also performed before any port
	build.  Meanwhile, you can use the command <command>portaudit
	-F -a</command> after you have installed some
	packages.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>The remainder of this chapter will explain how to use
      packages and ports to install and manage third-party software on
      FreeBSD.</para>

    <title>Finding Your Application</title>

    <para>Before you can install any applications you need to know what you
      want, and what the application is called.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD's list of available applications is growing all the
      time.  Fortunately, there are a number of ways to find what you
      want:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The FreeBSD web site maintains an up-to-date searchable
	  list of all the available applications, at <ulink
	  url="&url.base;/ports/index.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/</ulink>.
	  The ports are divided into categories, and you may either
	  search for an application by name (if you know it), or see
	  all the applications available in a category.</para>
      </listitem>

      <indexterm><primary>FreshPorts</primary></indexterm>

      <listitem>
	<para>Dan Langille maintains FreshPorts, at <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreshPorts.org/"></ulink>.  FreshPorts
	  tracks changes to the applications in the ports tree as they
	  happen, allows you to <quote>watch</quote> one or more
	  ports, and can send you email when they are updated.</para>
      </listitem>

      <indexterm><primary>FreshMeat</primary></indexterm>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you do not know the name of the application you want,
	  try using a site like FreshMeat (<ulink
	  url="http://www.freshmeat.net/"></ulink>) to find an
	  application, then check back at the FreeBSD site to see if
	  the application has been ported yet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you know the exact name of the port, but just need to
        find out which category it is in, you can use the
        &man.whereis.1; command.
	Simply type <command>whereis
        <replaceable>file</replaceable></command>, where
        <replaceable>file</replaceable> is the program you want to
        install.  If it is found on your system, you will be told
        where it is, as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>whereis lsof</userinput>
lsof: /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</screen>

      <para>This tells us that <command>lsof</command> (a system
	utility) can be found in the
	<filename>/usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</filename>
	directory.</para></listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Additionally, you can use a simple &man.echo.1; statement
	  to find where a port exists in the ports tree.  For
	  example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo /usr/ports/*/*lsof*</userinput>
/usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</screen>

	<para>Note that this will return any matched files downloaded into the
	  <filename class="directory">/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>
	  directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Yet another way to find a particular port is by using the
        Ports Collection's built-in search mechanism.  To use the
        search feature, you will need to be in the
        <filename>/usr/ports</filename> directory.  Once in that
        directory, run <command>make <maketarget>search</maketarget>
        name=<replaceable>program-name</replaceable></command> where
        <replaceable>program-name</replaceable> is the name of the
        program you want to find.  For example, if you were looking
        for <command>lsof</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make search name=lsof</userinput>
Port:   lsof-4.56.4
Path:   /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
Info:   Lists information about open files (similar to fstat(1))
Maint:  obrien@FreeBSD.org
Index:  sysutils
B-deps: 
R-deps: </screen>

      <para>The part of the output you want to pay particular
        attention to is the <quote>Path:</quote> line, since that
        tells you where to find the port.  The other information
        provided is not needed in order to install the port, so it
        will not be covered here.</para>

      <para>For more in-depth searching you can also use <command>make
       <maketarget>search</maketarget> key=<replaceable>string</replaceable></command>
       where <replaceable>string</replaceable> is some text to search for.
       This searches port names, comments, descriptions and
       dependencies and can be used to find ports which relate to a
       particular subject if you do not know the name of the program
       you are looking for.</para>

      <para>In both of these cases, the search string is case-insensitive.
       Searching for <quote>LSOF</quote> will yield the same results as
       searching for <quote>lsof</quote>.</para>

    <title>Using the Packages System</title>

    <para>There are several different tools used to manage packages on
      FreeBSD:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The <command>sysinstall</command> utility can be invoked on a
        running system to install, delete, and list available and

      </example>

      <para>If you do not have a source of local packages (such as a
        FreeBSD CD-ROM set) then it will probably be easier to use the
        <option>-r</option> option to &man.pkg.add.1;.  This will
        cause the utility to automatically determine the correct
        object format and release and then fetch and install the
        package from an FTP site.
      </para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary><command>pkg_add</command></primary></indexterm>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r <replaceable>lsof</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The example above would download the correct package and
	add it without any further user intervention.
	If you want to specify an alternative &os; Packages Mirror,
	instead of the main distribution site, you have to set the
	<envar>PACKAGESITE</envar> environment variable accordingly, to
	override the default settings.  &man.pkg.add.1;
	uses &man.fetch.3; to download the files, which honors various
	environment variables, including
	<envar>FTP_PASSIVE_MODE</envar>, <envar>FTP_PROXY</envar>, and
	<envar>FTP_PASSWORD</envar>.  You may need to set one or more
	of these if you are behind a firewall, or need to use an
	FTP/HTTP proxy.  See &man.fetch.3; for the complete list.
	Note that in the example above
	<literal>lsof</literal> is used instead of
	<literal>lsof-4.56.4</literal>.  When the remote fetching
	feature is used, the version number of the package must be
	removed.  &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically fetch the latest
	version of the application.</para>

      <note>
	<para>&man.pkg.add.1; will download the latest version of
	  your application if you are using &os.current; or
	  &os.stable;.  If you run a -RELEASE version, it will grab
	  the version of the package that was built with your
	  release.  It is possible to change this behavior by
	  overriding <envar>PACKAGESITE</envar>.
	  For example, if you run a &os;&nbsp;8.1-RELEASE
	  system, by default &man.pkg.add.1; will try to fetch
	  packages from
	  <literal>ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-8.1-release/Latest/</literal>.
	  If you want to force &man.pkg.add.1; to download
	  &os;&nbsp;8-STABLE packages, set <envar>PACKAGESITE</envar>
	  to
	  <literal>ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-8-stable/Latest/</literal>.
	</para>
      </note>

      <para>Package files are distributed in <filename>.tgz</filename>
          and <filename>.tbz</filename> formats.  You can find them at <ulink
          url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/packages/"></ulink>,
          or on the FreeBSD CD-ROM distribution.  Every CD on the
          FreeBSD 4-CD set (and the PowerPak, etc.) contains packages
          in the <filename>/packages</filename> directory.  The layout
          of the packages is similar to that of the
          <filename>/usr/ports</filename> tree.  Each category has its
          own directory, and every package can be found within the
          <filename>All</filename> directory.
      </para>

      <para>The directory structure of the package system matches the
        ports layout; they work with each other to form the entire
        package/port system.

      <indexterm>
        <primary>ports</primary>
        <secondary>installing</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The first thing that should be explained when it comes to
        the Ports Collection is what is actually meant by a
        <quote>skeleton</quote>.  In a nutshell, a port skeleton is a
        minimal set of files that tell your FreeBSD system how to
        cleanly compile and install a program.  Each port skeleton
        includes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>Makefile</filename>.  The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> contains various statements
	    that specify how the application should be compiled and
	    where it should be installed on your system.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>distinfo</filename> file.  This file
	    contains information about the files that must be
	    downloaded to build the port, and their checksums
	    (using &man.sha256.1;), to
	    verify that files have not been corrupted during the
	    download.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>files</filename> directory.  This
	    directory contains patches to make the program compile and
	    install on your FreeBSD system.  Patches are basically
	    small files that specify changes to particular files.
	    They are in plain text format, and basically say
	    <quote>Remove line 10</quote> or <quote>Change line 26 to
	    this ...</quote>.  Patches are also known as
	    <quote>diffs</quote> because they are generated by the
	    &man.diff.1; program.</para>

	  <para>This directory may also contain other files used to build
	    the port.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>pkg-descr</filename> file.  This is a more
	    detailed, often multiple-line, description of the program.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file.  This is a list
	    of all the files that will be installed by the port.  It
	    also tells the ports system what files to remove upon
	    deinstallation.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Some ports have other files, such as
        <filename>pkg-message</filename>.  The ports system uses these
        files to handle special situations.  If you want more details
        on these files, and on ports in general, check out the <ulink
        url="&url.books.porters-handbook;/index.html">FreeBSD Porter's
        Handbook</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The port includes instructions on how to build source
        code, but does not include the actual source code.  You can
        get the source code from a CD-ROM or from the Internet.
        Source code is distributed in whatever manner the software
        author desires.  Frequently this is a tarred and gzipped file,
        but it might be compressed with some other tool or even
        uncompressed.  The program source code, whatever form it comes
        in, is called a <quote>distfile</quote>.  The two methods for
        installing a &os; port are described below.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You must be logged in as <username>root</username> to
          install ports.</para>
      </note>

      <warning>
	<para>Before installing any port, you should be sure to have
	  an up-to-date Ports Collection and you should check <ulink
	  url="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/"></ulink> for security issues
	  related to your port.</para>

	<para>A security vulnerabilities check can be automatically
	  done by <application>portaudit</application> before any new
	  application installation.  This tool can be found in the
	  Ports Collection (<filename
	  role="package">ports-mgmt/portaudit</filename>).  Consider
	  running <command>portaudit -F</command> before installing a
	  new port, to fetch the current vulnerabilities database.  A
	  security audit and an update of the database will be
	  performed during the daily security system check.  For more
	  information read the &man.portaudit.1; and &man.periodic.8;
	  manual pages.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The Ports Collection makes an assumption that you have a working
	Internet connection.  If you do not, you will need to put a copy of the
	distfile into <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>
	manually.</para>

	<para>To begin, change to the directory for the port you want to
	  install:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</userinput></screen>

        <para>Once inside the <filename>lsof</filename> directory, you
	  will see the port skeleton.  The next step is to compile, or
	  <quote>build</quote>, the port.  This is done by simply
	  typing <command>make</command> at the prompt.  Once you have
	  done so, you should see something like this:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>
&gt;&gt; lsof_4.57D.freebsd.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/ports/distfiles/.
&gt;&gt; Attempting to fetch from ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/.

...
&prompt.root;</screen>

        <para>Notice that once the compile is complete you are
	  returned to your prompt.  The next step is to install the
	  port.  In order to install it, you simply need to tack one word
	  onto the <command>make</command> command, and that word is
	  <maketarget>install</maketarget>:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
===&gt;  Installing for lsof-4.57

===&gt;   Registering installation for lsof-4.57
===&gt;  SECURITY NOTE:
      This port has installed the following binaries which execute with
      increased privileges.
&prompt.root;</screen>

        <para>Once you are returned to your prompt, you should be able to
          run the application you just installed.  Since
	  <command>lsof</command> is a
	  program that runs with increased privileges, a security
	  warning is shown.  During the building and installation of
	  ports, you should take heed of any other warnings that
	  may appear.</para>

	<para>It is a good idea to delete the working subdirectory,
	  which contains all the temporary files used during compilation.
	  Not only does it consume valuable disk space, but it would also
	  cause problems later when upgrading to the newer version of the
	  port.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make clean</userinput>
===&gt;  Cleaning for lsof-4.57
&prompt.root;</screen>

        <note>
          <para>You can save two extra steps by just running <command>make
	    <maketarget>install clean</maketarget></command> instead of
	    <command>make</command>,
	    <command>make <maketarget>install</maketarget></command> and
	    <command>make <maketarget>clean</maketarget></command>
	    as three separate steps.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>Some shells keep a cache of the commands that are
	    available in the directories listed in the
	    <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable, to speed up
	    lookup operations for the executable file of these
	    commands.  If you are using one of these shells, you might
	    have to use the <command>rehash</command> command after
	    installing a port, before the newly installed commands can
	    be used.  This command will work for shells like
	    <command>tcsh</command>.  Use the <command>hash -r</command>
	    command for shells like <command>sh</command>.  Look at the
	    documentation for your shell for more information.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Some third-party DVD-ROM products such as the FreeBSD Toolkit
	  from the <ulink url="http://www.freebsdmall.com/">FreeBSD
	  Mall</ulink> contain distfiles.  They can be used with the Ports
	  Collection.  Mount the DVD-ROM on <filename>/cdrom</filename>.  If
	  you use a different mount point, set <makevar>CD_MOUNTPTS</makevar>
	  make variable.  The needed distfiles will be automatically used
	  if they are present on the disk.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Please be aware that the licenses of a few ports do
	    not allow for inclusion on the CD-ROM.  This could be
	    because a registration form needs to be filled out before
	    downloading or redistribution is not allowed, or for
	    another reason.  If you wish to install a port not
	    included on the CD-ROM, you will need to be online in
	    order to do so.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The ports system uses &man.fetch.1; to download the
	  files, which honors various environment variables, including
	  <envar>FTP_PASSIVE_MODE</envar>, <envar>FTP_PROXY</envar>,
	  and <envar>FTP_PASSWORD</envar>.  You may need to set one or
	  more of these if you are behind a firewall, or need to use
	  an FTP/HTTP proxy.  See &man.fetch.3; for the complete
	  list.</para>

	<para>For users which cannot be connected all the time, the
	  <command>make <maketarget>fetch</maketarget></command> option is
	  provided.  Just run this command at the top level directory
	  (<filename>/usr/ports</filename>) and the required files
	  will be downloaded for you.  This command will also work in
	  the lower level categories, for example:
	  <filename>/usr/ports/net</filename>.
	  Note that if a port depends on libraries or other ports this will
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> fetch the distfiles of those ports too.
	  Replace <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> with
	  <maketarget>fetch-recursive</maketarget>
	  if you want to fetch all the dependencies of a port too.</para>

	<note><para>You can build all the ports in a category or as a
	  whole by running <command>make</command> in the top level
	  directory, just like the aforementioned <command>make
	  <maketarget>fetch</maketarget></command> method.  This is
	  dangerous, however, as some ports cannot co-exist.  In other
	  cases, some ports can install two different files with the
	  same filename.</para></note>

	<para>In some rare cases, users may need to acquire the
	  tarballs from a site other than the
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> (the location where files
	  are downloaded from).  You can override the
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> option with the following
	  command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/<replaceable>directory</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE= \
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/ fetch</userinput></screen>

	<para>In this example we change the
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> option to <hostid
	  role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/</hostid>.</para>

	<note><para>Some ports allow (or even require) you to provide
	  build options which can enable/disable parts of the
	  application which are unneeded, certain security options,
	  and other customizations.  A few which come to mind are
	  <filename role="package">www/mozilla</filename>, <filename
	  role="package">security/gpgme</filename>, and <filename
	  role="package">mail/sylpheed-claws</filename>.  A message
	  will be displayed when options such as these are
	  available.</para></note>

      <sect3>
        <title>Overriding the Default Ports Directories</title>

	<para>Sometimes it is useful (or mandatory) to use a different
	  working and target directory.  The
	  <makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar> and <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>
	  variables can override the default directories.  For
	  example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make WRKDIRPREFIX=/usr/home/example/ports install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will compile the port in
	    <filename>/usr/home/example/ports</filename> and install
	    everything under <filename>/usr/local</filename>.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make PREFIX=/usr/home/example/local install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will compile it in <filename>/usr/ports</filename> and
	  install it in
	  <filename>/usr/home/example/local</filename>.</para>

	<para>And of course,</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make WRKDIRPREFIX=../ports PREFIX=../local install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will combine the two (it is too long to completely write
	  on this page, but it should give you the general
	  idea).</para>

	<para>Alternatively, these variables can also be set as part
	  of your environment.  Read the manual page for your shell
	  for instructions on doing so.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Dealing with <command>imake</command></title>

	<para>Some ports that use <command>imake</command> (a part of
	  the X Window System) do not work well with
	  <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, and will insist on installing
	  under <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>.  Similarly, some Perl
	  ports ignore <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> and install in the
	  Perl tree.  Making these ports respect
	  <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> is a difficult or impossible
	  job.</para>

	<title>Reconfiguring Ports</title>

	<para>When building certain ports, you may be presented with a
	  ncurses-based menu from which you can select certain build options.
	  It is not uncommon for users to wish to revisit this menu to add,
	  remove, or change these options after a port has been built.  There
	  are many ways to do this.  One option is to go into the directory
	  containing the port and type <command>make
	  <maketarget>config</maketarget></command>, which will simply present
	  the menu again with the same options selected.  Another option is to
	  use <command>make <maketarget>showconfig</maketarget></command>,
	  which will show you all the configuration options for the port.  Yet
	  another option is to execute <command>make
	  <maketarget>rmconfig</maketarget></command> which will remove all
	  selected options and allow you to start over.  All of these options,
	  and others, are explained in great detail in the manual page for
	  &man.ports.7;.</para>

      <para>The <application>portupgrade</application> utility is designed
	to easily upgrade installed ports.  It is available from the <filename
	role="package">ports-mgmt/portupgrade</filename> port.  Install it like
	any other port, using the <command>make <maketarget>install
	clean</maketarget></command> command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>Scan the list of installed ports with the <command>pkgdb
	-F</command> command and fix all the inconsistencies it reports.  It is
	a good idea to do this regularly, before every upgrade.</para>

      <para>When you run <command>portupgrade -a</command>,
	<application>portupgrade</application> will begin to upgrade all the
	outdated ports installed on your system.  Use the <option>-i</option>
	flag if you want to be asked for confirmation of every individual
	upgrade.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -ai</userinput></screen>

      <para>If you want to upgrade only a
	certain application, not all available ports, use <command>portupgrade
	<replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></command>.  Include the
	<option>-R</option> flag if <application>portupgrade</application>
	should first upgrade all the ports required by the given
	application.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -R firefox</userinput></screen>

      <para>To use packages instead of ports for installation, provide
	<option>-P</option> flag.  With this option
	<application>portupgrade</application> searches
	the local directories listed in <envar>PKG_PATH</envar>, or
	fetches packages from remote site if it is not found locally.
	If packages can not be found locally or fetched remotely,
	<application>portupgrade</application> will use ports.
	To avoid using ports, specify <option>-PP</option>.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -PP gnome2</userinput></screen>

      <para>To just fetch distfiles (or packages, if
	<option>-P</option> is specified) without building or
	installing anything, use <option>-F</option>.
	For further information see &man.portupgrade.1;.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portmanager <replaceable>x11/gnome2</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>If there are any problems regarding the dependencies for the

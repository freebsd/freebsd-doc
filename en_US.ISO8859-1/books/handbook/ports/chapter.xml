    <para>&os; is bundled with a rich collection of system tools as
      part of the base system.  In addition,  &os; provides two
      complementary technologies for installing third-party software:
      the &os; Ports Collection, for installing from source, and
      packages, for installing from pre-built binaries.  Either
      method may be used to install software from local media or
      from the network.</para>

    <title>Overview of Software Installation</title>

    <para>The typical steps for installing third-party software on a
      &unix; system include:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Find and download the software, which might be
	  distributed in source code format or as a binary.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Unpack the software from its distribution format.  This
	  is typically a tarball compressed with &man.compress.1;,
	  &man.gzip.1;, or &man.bzip2.1;.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Locate the documentation in
	  <filename>INSTALL</filename>, <filename>README</filename>
	  or some file in a <filename>doc/</filename> subdirectory and
	  read up on how to install the software.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>If the software was distributed in source format,
	  compile it.  This may involve editing a
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> or running a
	  <command>configure</command> script.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Test and install the software.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>If the software package was not deliberately ported, or
      tested to work, on &os;, the source code may need editing in
      order for it to install and run properly.  At the time of this
      writing, over &os.numports; third-party applications have been
      ported to &os;.</para>

    <para>A &os; package contains pre-compiled copies of all the
      commands for an application, as well as any configuration files
      and documentation.  A package can be manipulated with the
      <application>pkg</application> commands, such as
      <command>pkg install</command>.</para>

    <para>A &os; port is a collection of files designed to automate
      the process of compiling an application from source code.  The
      files that comprise a port contain all the necessary information
      to automatically download, extract, patch, compile, and install
      the application.</para>

    <para>The ports system can also be used to generate packages which
      can be manipulated with the &os; package management
      commands.</para>

    <para>Both packages and ports understand dependencies.  If a
      package or port is used to install an application and a
      dependent library is not already installed, the library will
      automatically be installed first.</para>

    <para>While the two technologies are similar, packages and
      ports each have their own strengths.  Select the technology that
      meets your requirements for installing a particular
      application.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Package Benefits</title>

      <listitem>
	<para>A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than
	  the compressed tarball containing the source code for the
	  application.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require compilation time.  For large
	  applications, such as <application>Mozilla</application>,
	  <application>KDE</application>, or
	  <application>GNOME</application>, this can be important
	  on a slow system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages do not require any understanding of the process
	  involved in compiling software on &os;.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <title>Port Benefits</title>

      <listitem>
	<para>Packages are normally compiled with conservative
	  options because they have to run on the maximum number of
	  systems.  By compiling from the port, one can change the
	  compilation options.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some applications have compile-time options relating to
	  which features are installed.  For example,
	  <application>Apache</application> can be configured with a
	  wide variety of different built-in options.</para>

	<para>In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same
	  application to specify certain settings.  For example,
	  <application>Ghostscript</application> is available as a
	  <filename>ghostscript</filename> package and a
	  <filename>ghostscript-nox11</filename> package, depending on
	  whether or not <application>Xorg</application> is installed.
	  Creating multiple packages rapidly becomes impossible if an
	  application has more than one or two different compile-time
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The licensing conditions of some software forbid binary
	  distribution.  Such software must be distributed as source
	  code which must be compiled by the end-user.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Some people do not trust binary distributions or prefer
	  to read through source code in order to look for potential
	  problems.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Source code is needed in
	  order to apply custom patches.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To keep track of updated ports, subscribe to the
      &a.ports; and the &a.ports-bugs;.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Before installing any application, check <link
	  xlink:href="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/"></link>
	for security issues related to the application or type
	<command>pkg audit -F</command> to check all installed
	applications for known vulnerabilities.</para>

    <para>The remainder of this chapter explains how to use packages
      and ports to install and manage third-party software on

    <title>Finding Software</title>

    <para>&os;'s list of available applications is growing all the

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The &os; web site maintains an up-to-date searchable
	  list of all the available applications, at <link

	<indexterm><primary>FreshPorts</primary></indexterm>

	<para>Dan Langille maintains <link

	<para>Package names include the version number and in case of
	  ports based on python, the version number of the version of
	  python the package was built with.  Some ports also have
	  multiple versions available.  In case of
	  <application>subversion</application> there are different
	  versions available, as well as different compile options.
	  In this case, the statically linked version of
	  <application>subversion</application>.  When indicating
	  which package to install, it is best to specify the
	  application by the port origin, which is the path in the
	  ports tree.  Repeat the <command>pkg search</command> with
	  <option>-o</option> to list the origin of each

	<para>Searching by shell globs, regular expressions, exact
	  match, by description, or any other field in the repository
	  database is also supported by <command>pkg search</command>.
	  After installing <package>ports-mgmt/pkg</package> or
	  <package>ports-mgmt/pkg-devel</package>, see
	  &man.pkg-search.8; for more details.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If the Ports Collection is already installed, there are
	  several methods to query the local version of the ports
	  tree.  To find out which category a port is in, type
	  <command>whereis <replaceable>file</replaceable></command>,
	  where <replaceable>file</replaceable> is the program to be
	  installed:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>whereis lsof</userinput>
lsof: /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</screen>

	<para>Alternately, an &man.echo.1; statement can be

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo /usr/ports/*/*lsof*</userinput>
/usr/ports/sysutils/lsof</screen>

	<para>Note that this will also return any matched files
	  downloaded into the
	  <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename> directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Another way to find software is by using the Ports
	  Collection's built-in search mechanism.  To use the search
	  feature, <application>cd</application> to
	  <filename>/usr/ports</filename> then run <command>make
	    search name=program-name</command> where
	  <replaceable>program-name</replaceable> is the name of the
	  software.  For example, to search for
	  <command>lsof</command>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make search name=lsof</userinput>
Port:   lsof-4.88.d,8
Path:   /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
Info:   Lists information about open files (similar to fstat(1))
Maint:  ler@lerctr.org
Index:  sysutils
B-deps:
R-deps: </screen>

	<tip>
	  <para>The built-in search mechanism uses a file
	    of index information.  If a message indicates that the
	    <filename>INDEX</filename> is required, run
	    <command>make fetchindex</command> to download the current
	    index file.  With the <filename>INDEX</filename> present,
	    <command>make search</command> will be able to perform the
	    requested search.</para>
	</tip>

	<para>The <quote>Path:</quote> line indicates where to find
	  the port.</para>

	<para>To receive less information, use the
	  <command>quicksearch</command> feature:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make quicksearch name=lsof</userinput>
Port:   lsof-4.88.d,8
Path:   /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
Info:   Lists information about open files (similar to fstat(1))</screen>

	<para>For more in-depth searching, use
	  <command>make search
	  key=<replaceable>string</replaceable></command> or
	  <command>make quicksearch
	  key=<replaceable>string</replaceable></command>, where
	  <replaceable>string</replaceable> is some text to search
	  for.  The text can be in comments, descriptions, or
	  dependencies in order to find ports which relate to a
	  particular subject when the name of the program is
	  unknown.</para>

	<para>When using <buildtarget>search</buildtarget> or
	  <buildtarget>quicksearch</buildtarget>, the search string
	  is case-insensitive.  Searching for <quote>LSOF</quote> will
	  yield the same results as searching for

    <title>Using <application>pkg</application> for Binary Package
      Management</title>

    <para><application>pkg</application> is the next generation
      replacement for the traditional &os; package management tools,

      faster and easier.</para>

    <para><application>pkg</application> is not a replacement for
      port management tools like
      <package>ports-mgmt/portmaster</package> or
      <package>ports-mgmt/portupgrade</package>.  These tools can be
      used to install third-party software from both binary packages
      and the Ports Collection, while
      <application>pkg</application> installs only binary
      packages.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="pkgng-initial-setup">
      <title>Getting Started with
	<application>pkg</application></title>

      <para>&os; includes a bootstrap utility which can be used to

      <para>To bootstrap the system, run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/usr/sbin/pkg</userinput></screen>

      <para>For earlier &os; versions,

&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>When upgrading an existing system that originally used the
	older package system, the database must be converted to the
	new format, so that the new tools are aware of the already
	installed packages.  Once <application>pkg</application> has
	been installed, the
	package database must be converted from the traditional format
	to the new format by running this command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg2ng</userinput></screen>

      <note><para>This step is not required for new installations that
	do not yet have any third-party software

	<para>This step is not reversible.  Once the package database
	  has been converted to the <application>pkg</application>
	  format, the traditional <literal>pkg_*</literal> tools
	  should no longer be used.</para>
      </important>

      <note>
	<para>The package database conversion may emit errors as the
	  contents are converted to the new version.  Generally, these
	  errors can be safely ignored.  However, a list of
	  third-party software that was not successfully converted
	  will be listed after <command>pkg2ng</command> has finished
	  and these applications must be manually reinstalled.</para>

      tell &os; how to compile and install that program.  Each port
      skeleton includes these files and directories:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><filename>Makefile</filename>: contains statements that
	  specify how the application should be compiled and where

      <para>Since <command>lsof</command> is a program that runs
	with increased privileges, a security warning is displayed
	as it is installed.  Once the installation is complete, the
	prompt will be returned.</para>

      <para>Some shells keep a cache of the commands that are
	available in the directories listed in the
	<envar>PATH</envar> environment variable, to speed up lookup
	operations for the executable file of these commands.  Users

	can be used without specifying its full path.  Use
	<command>hash -r</command> instead for the
	<command>sh</command> shell.  Refer to the documentation
	for the shell for more information.</para>

      <para>During installation, a working subdirectory is created
	which contains all the temporary files used during

      </note>

      <sect3>
	<title>Customizing Ports Installation</title>

	<para>Some ports provide build options which can be used to
	  enable or disable application components, provide security
	  options, or allow for other customizations.  Examples
	  include <package>www/firefox</package>,
	  <package>security/gpgme</package>, and
	  <package>mail/sylpheed-claws</package>.
	  If the port depends upon other ports which have configurable
	  options, it may pause several times for user interaction
	  as the default behavior is to prompt the user to select
	  options from a menu.  To avoid this, run <command>make
	    config-recursive</command> within the port skeleton to do
	  this configuration in one batch.  Then, run <command>make
	    install [clean]</command> to compile and install the
	  port.</para>

	<tip>
	  <para>When using
	    <buildtarget>config-recursive</buildtarget>, the list of
	    ports to configure are gathered by the
	    <buildtarget>all-depends-list</buildtarget> target.  It is
	    recommended to run <command>make
	      config-recursive</command> until all dependent ports
	    options have been defined, and ports options screens no
	    longer appear, to be certain that all dependency options
	    have been configured.</para>
	</tip>

	<para>There are several ways to revisit a port's build options
	  menu in order to add, remove, or change these options after
	  a port has been built.  One method is to
	  <command>cd</command> into the directory containing the
	  port and type <command>make config</command>.  Another
	  option is to use <command>make showconfig</command>.
	  Another option is to execute <command>make
	    rmconfig</command> which will remove all selected options
	  and allow you to start over.  All of these options, and
	  others, are explained in great detail in
	  &man.ports.7;.</para>

	<para>The ports system uses &man.fetch.1; to download the
	  source files, which supports various environment variables.
	  The <envar>FTP_PASSIVE_MODE</envar>,
	  <envar>FTP_PROXY</envar>, and <envar>FTP_PASSWORD</envar>
	  variables may need to be set if the &os; system is behind
	  a firewall or FTP/HTTP proxy.  See &man.fetch.3; for the
	  complete list of supported variables.</para>

	<para>For users who cannot be connected to the Internet all
	  the time, <command>make fetch</command> can be run within
	  <filename>/usr/ports</filename>, to fetch all distfiles, or
	  within a category, such as
	  <filename>/usr/ports/net</filename>, or within the specific
	  port skeleton.  Note that if a port has any dependencies,
	  running this command in a category or ports skeleton will
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> fetch the distfiles of ports from
	  another category.  Instead, use <command>make
	    fetch-recursive</command> to also fetch the distfiles for
	  all the dependencies of a port.</para>

	<para>In rare cases, such as when an organization has a local
	  distfiles repository, the <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>
	  variable can be used to override the download locations
	  specified in the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  When using,
	  specify the alternate location:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/<replaceable>directory</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE= \
<replaceable>ftp://ftp.organization.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/</replaceable> fetch</userinput></screen>

	<para>The <varname>WRKDIRPREFIX</varname> and
	  <varname>PREFIX</varname> variables can override the default
	  working and target directories.  For example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make WRKDIRPREFIX=/usr/home/example/ports install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will compile the port in
	  <filename>/usr/home/example/ports</filename> and install
	  everything under <filename>/usr/local</filename>.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make PREFIX=/usr/home/example/local install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will compile the port in <filename>/usr/ports</filename>
	  and install it in
	  <filename>/usr/home/example/local</filename>.  And:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make WRKDIRPREFIX=../ports PREFIX=../local install</userinput></screen>

	<para>will combine the two.</para>

	<para>These can also be set as environmental variables.  Refer
	  to the manual page for your shell for instructions on how to
	  set an environmental variable.</para>

    <title>Building Packages with
      <application>Poudriere</application></title>

    <para><application>Poudriere</application> is a
      <acronym>BSD</acronym>-licensed utility for creating and testing
      &os; packages.  It uses &os; jails to set up isolated
      compilation environments.  These jails can be used to build
      packages for versions of &os; that are different from the system
      on which it is installed, and also to build packages for i386 if
      the host is an &arch.amd64; system.  Once the packages are
      built, they are in a layout identical to the official mirrors.
      These packages are usable by &man.pkg.8; and other package
      management tools.</para>

    <para><application>Poudriere</application> is installed using
      the <package role="port">ports-mgmt/poudriere</package> package
      or port.  The installation includes a sample configuration
      file <filename>/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf.sample</filename>.
      Copy this file to
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf</filename>.  Edit the
      copied file to suit the local configuration.</para>

    <para>While <acronym>ZFS</acronym> is not required on the system
      running <application>poudriere</application>, it is beneficial.
      When <acronym>ZFS</acronym> is used,
      <varname>ZPOOL</varname> must be specified in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf</filename> and
      <varname>FREEBSD_HOST</varname> should be set to a nearby
      mirror.  Defining <varname>CCACHE_DIR</varname> enables the use
      of <package role="port">devel/ccache</package> to cache
      compilation and reduce build times for frequently-compiled code.
      It may be convenient to put
      <application>poudriere</application> datasets in an isolated
      tree mounted at <filename
	>/poudriere</filename>.  Defaults for the
      other configuration values are adequate.</para>

    <para>The number of processor cores detected is used to define how
      many builds should run in parallel.  Supply enough virtual
      memory, either with <acronym>RAM</acronym> or swap space.  If
      virtual memory runs out, compiling jails will stop and be torn
      down, resulting in weird error messages.</para>

      <para>On a single computer, <application>poudriere</application>
	can build ports with multiple configurations, in multiple

      <para>The basic configuration shown here puts a single jail-,
	port-, and set-specific <filename>make.conf</filename> in
	<filename

	The filename in this example is created by combining the jail
	name, port name, and set name:
	<filename><replaceable>10amd64-local-workstation</replaceable>-make.conf</filename>.
	The system <filename>make.conf</filename> and this new file

      <title>Configuring pkg Clients to Use a Poudriere
	Repository</title>

      <para>While it is possible to use both a custom repository along
	side of the official repository, sometimes it is useful to
	disable the official repository.  This is done by creating a
	configuration file that overrides and disables the official
	configuration file.  Create
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf</filename>
	that contains the following:</para>

      <screen>FreeBSD: {
	enabled: no
}</screen>

      <para>Usually it is easiest to serve a poudriere repository to
	the client machines via HTTP.  Setup a webserver to serve up
	the package directory, usually something like:
	<filename>/usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/<replaceable>10amd64</replaceable></filename>.
	Where <filename>10amd64</filename> is the name of the
	build.</para>

      <para>If the URL to the package repository is:
	<literal>http://pkg.example.com/10amd64</literal>, then the
	repository configuration file in
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/custom.conf</filename>
	would look like:</para>

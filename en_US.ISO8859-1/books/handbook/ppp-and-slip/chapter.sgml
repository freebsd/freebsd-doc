    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>If you are connecting to the Internet via modem, or wish to
      provide dial-up connections to the Internet for others using FreeBSD,
      you have the option of using PPP or SLIP.</para>
      
    <para>This chapter covers three varieties of PPP;
      <emphasis>user</emphasis>, <emphasis>kernel</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>PPPoE</emphasis> (PPP over Ethernet).  It also covers
      setting up a SLIP client and server.</para>

    <para>The first variety of PPP that will be covered is User PPP.  User
      PPP was introduced into FreeBSD in 2.0.5-RELEASE as an addition to
      the already existing kernel implementation of PPP.</para>

    <para>You may be wondering what the main difference is between User
      PPP and kernel PPP.  The answer is simple; user PPP does not run as
      a daemon, and can run as and when desired.  No PPP interface needs
      to be compiled into their kernel; it runs as a user process, and uses
      the tunnel device driver (<devicename>tun</devicename>) to get data
      into and out of the kernel.</para>

    <para>From here on out in this chapter, user ppp will simply be
      referred to as ppp unless a distinction needs to be made between it
      and and any other PPP software such as <command>pppd</command>.
      Unless otherwise stated, all of the commands explained in this
      section should be executed as root.</para>

	<title>Assumptions</title>

	<para>This document assumes you have the following:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>An account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which
	      you connect to using PPP.  Further, you have a modem or
	      other device connected to your system and configured
	      correctly, which allows you to connect to your ISP.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The dial-up number(s) of your ISP.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Your login name and password.  This can be either a
	      regular UNIX-style login and password pair, or a PAP or CHAP
	      login and password pair.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The IP address(es) of one or more name servers.
	      Normally, you will be given two IP addresses by your ISP to
	      use for this.  If they have not given you at least one, then
	      you can use the <command>enable dns</command> command in
	      your <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file to tell
	      <application>ppp</application> to set the name servers for
	      you.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>The following information may be supplied by your ISP, but
	  is not completely necessary:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The IP address of your ISP's gateway.  The gateway is
	      the machine to which you will connect and will be set up as
	      your <emphasis>default route</emphasis>.  If you do not have
	      this information, we can make one up and your ISP's PPP
	      server will tell us the correct value when we connect.</para>

	    <para>This IP number is referred to as
	      <literal>HISADDR</literal> by
	      <application>ppp</application>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The netmask you should use.  If your ISP has not
	      provided you with one, you can safely use <hostid
	      role="netmask">255.255.255.0</hostid>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If your ISP provides you with a static IP address and
	      hostname, you can enter it.  Otherwise, we simply let the
	      peer assign whatever IP address it sees fit.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
 
	<para>If you do not have any of the required information, contact
	  your ISP and make sure they provide it to you.</para>

	<title>Preparing the Kernel</title>

        <para>As previously mentioned, <application>ppp</application>
          uses the <devicename>tun</devicename> device, and whichever kernel
          you are using must have <devicename>tun</devicename> configured.
          The <devicename>tun</devicename> device is preconfigured
          for the default <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel that ships
          with FreeBSD.  However, if you have installed a custom kernel,
          you must make sure your kernel is configured for ppp.</para>

	<para>To check, go to your kernel compile directory
	  (<filename>/sys/i386/conf</filename> or
	  <filename>/sys/pc98/conf</filename>) and examine your
	  configuration file.  It should have the following line somewhere
	  in it:</para>

	<programlisting>
pseudo-device	tun	1</programlisting>

	<para>If this line is not present, you will need to add it to the
	  configuration file and recompile your kernel.  The stock
	  <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel has this included, so if you
	  have not installed a custom kernel or do not have a
	  <filename>/sys</filename> directory, you do not have to change
	  anything.  If you do need to recompile your kernel, please refer
	  to the <link linkend="kernelconfig">kernel configuration</link>
	  section for more information.</para>

	<para>You can check how many tunnel devices your current kernel
	  has by typing the following:</para>
	  
	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig -a</userinput>
tun0: flags=8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet 200.10.100.1 --&gt; 203.10.100.24 netmask 0xffffffff
tun1: flags=8050&lt;POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 576
tun2: flags=8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        inet 203.10.100.1 --&gt; 203.10.100.20 netmask 0xffffffff
tun3: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500</screen>

	<note>
	  <para>In FreeBSD 4.0 and later releases, you will only see any
	    <devicename>tun</devicename> devices which have already been
	    used.  This means you might not see <emphasis>any</emphasis>
	    <devicename>tun</devicename> devices.  If this is the case, do
	    not worry; the device should be created dynamically when
	    <command>ppp</command> attempts to use it.</para>
	</note>

	<para>This case shows four tunnel devices, two of which are
	  currently configured and being used.  It should be noted that
	  the <literal>RUNNING</literal> flag above indicates that the
	  interface has been used at some point&mdash;it is not an error
	  if your interface does not show up as
	  <literal>RUNNING</literal>.</para>

	<para>If for some reason you have a kernel that does not have the
	  <devicename>tun</devicename> device in it and cannot recompile
	  the kernel, all is not lost.  You should be able to dynamically
	  load the code.  Please refer to the appropriate
	  &man.modload.8; and &man.lkm.4; man pages for further
	  details.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Check the <devicename>tun</devicename> device</title>

	<para>Under normal circumstances, most users will only require one
	  <devicename>tun</devicename> device
	  (<filename>/dev/tun0</filename>).  If you have specified more
	  than one on the <literal>pseudo-device</literal> line for
	  <devicename>tun</devicename> in your kernel configuration file,
	  then alter all references to <devicename>tun0</devicename> below
	  to reflect whichever device number you are using (e.g.,
	  <devicename>tun2</devicename>).</para>

	<para>The easiest way to make sure that the
	  <devicename>tun0</devicename> device is configured correctly,
	  is to remake the device.  This process is quite easy.  To remake
	  the device, do the following:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./MAKEDEV tun0</userinput></screen>

	<para>If you need 16 tunnel devices in your kernel, you will need
	  to create them.  This can be done by executing the following
	  commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./MAKEDEV tun15</userinput></screen>

	<para>To confirm that the kernel is configured correctly, issue
	  the follow command and compare the results:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig tun0</userinput>
tun0: flags=8050&lt;POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mut 1500</screen>

	<para>The <literal>RUNNING</literal> flag may not yet be set, in
	  which case you will see:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig tun0</userinput>
tun0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500</screen>

	<para>Remember from earlier that you might not see the device if it
	  has not been used yet, as <devicename>tun</devicename> devices are
	  created on demand in FreeBSD 4.0 and later releases.</para>

	<title>Name Resolution Configuration</title>

	<para>The resolver is the part of the system that turns IP
	  addresses into hostnames and vice versa.  It can be configured
	  to look for maps that describe IP to hostname mappings in one of
	  two places.  The first is a file called
	  <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>.  Read &man.hosts.5; for more
	  information.  The second is the Internet Domain Name Service
	  (DNS), a distributed data base, the discussion of which is
	  beyond the scope of this document.</para>

	<para>The resolver is a set of system calls that do the name
	  mappings, but you have to tell them where to find their
	  information.  You do this by first editing the file
	  <filename>/etc/host.conf</filename>.  Do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	  call this file <filename>/etc/hosts.conf</filename> (note the
	  extra <literal>s</literal>) as the results can be
	  confusing.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Edit <filename>/etc/host.conf</filename></title>

	  <para>This file should contain the following two lines (in this
	    order):</para>

	  <programlisting>
hosts
bind</programlisting>

	  <para>These instruct the resolver to first look in the file
	    <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>, and then to consult the DNS
	    if the name was not found.</para>
	</sect4>
      
	<sect4>
	  <title>Edit <filename>/etc/hosts</filename></title>

	  <para>This file should contain the IP addresses and names of
	    machines on your network.  At a bare minimum it should contain
	    entries for the machine which will be running ppp.  Assuming
	    that your machine is called <hostid
	    role="fqdn">foo.bar.com</hostid> with the IP address <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid>,
	    <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> should contain:</para>

	  <programlisting>
127.0.0.1	localhost.bar.com	localhost
127.0.0.1	localhost.bar.com.
10.0.0.1	foo.bar.com		foo
10.0.0.1	foo.bar.com.</programlisting>

	  <para>The first two lines define the alias
	    <hostid>localhost</hostid> as a synonym for the current
	    machine.  Regardless of your own IP address, the IP address
	    for this line should always be <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">127.0.0.1</hostid>.  The second two lines map
	    the name <hostid role="fqdn">foo.bar.com</hostid> (and the
	    shorthand <hostid>foo</hostid>) to the IP address <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid>.</para>

	  <para>If your provider allocates you a static IP address and
	    name, use them in place of the <hostid
	    role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid> entry.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Edit <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename></title>

	  <para>The <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> file tells the
	    resolver how to behave.  If you are running your own DNS, you
	    may leave this file empty.  Normally, you will need to enter
	    the following line(s):</para>

	  <programlisting>
domain <replaceable>bar.com</replaceable>
nameserver <replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable>
nameserver <replaceable>y.y.y.y</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>The <hostid
	    role="ipaddr"><replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable></hostid> and 
	    <hostid role="ipaddr"><replaceable>y.y.y.y</replaceable></hostid>
	    addresses are those given to you by your ISP.  Add as many
	    <literal>nameserver</literal> lines as your ISP provides.  The
	    <literal>domain</literal> line defaults to your hostname's
	    domain, and is probably unnecessary.  Refer to the
	    &man.resolv.conf.5; manual page for details of other possible
	    entries in this file.</para>

	  <para>If you are running PPP version 2 or greater, the
	    <command>enable dns</command> command will tell PPP to request
	    that your ISP confirms the nameserver values.  If your ISP
	    supplies different addresses (or if there are no nameserver
	    lines in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>), PPP will
	    rewrite the file with the ISP-supplied values.</para>
	</sect4>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title><application>PPP</application> Configuration</title>

	<para>Both <command>ppp</command> and <command>pppd</command>
	  (the kernel level implementation of PPP) use the configuration
	  files located in the <filename>/usr/share/examples/ppp</filename> directory.
	  The sample configuration files provided are a good reference,
	  so do not delete them.</para>

	<para>Configuring <command>ppp</command> requires that you edit a
	  number of files, depending on your requirements.  What you put
	  in them depends to some extent on whether your ISP allocates IP
	  addresses statically (i.e., you get given one IP address, and
	  always use that one) or dynamically (i.e., your IP address
	  changes each time you connect to your ISP).</para>

	<sect4 id="userppp-staticIP">
	  <title>PPP and Static IP Addresses</title>

	  <para>You will need to create a configuration file called

    <sect2>
      <title>Setting up Kernel PPP</title>

      <para>Before you start setting up PPP on your machine make sure
	that <command>pppd</command> is located in
	<filename>/usr/sbin</filename> and the directory
	<filename>/etc/ppp</filename> exists.</para>

      <para><command>pppd</command> can work in two modes:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>As a <quote>client</quote>, i.e., you want to connect your
	    machine to the outside world via a PPP serial connection or
	    modem line.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>as a <quote>server</quote>, i.e. your machine is located on
	    the network and used to connect other computers using
	    PPP.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>In both cases you will need to set up an options file
        (<filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename> or
	<filename>~/.ppprc</filename> if you have more than one user on
	your machine that uses PPP).</para>

      <para>You also will need some modem/serial software (preferably
        kermit) so you can dial and establish a connection with the
	remote host.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using <command>pppd</command> as a client</title>

      <para>I used the following <filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename> to
	connect to CISCO terminal server PPP line.</para>

      <para>To connect:</para>
      
      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Dial to the remote host using kermit (or some other modem
	    program), and enter your user name and password (or whatever
	    is needed to enable PPP on the remote host).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Exit kermit (without hanging up the line).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Enter the following:</para>

      <para>Now your computer is connected with PPP.  If the connection

	<title>Prerequisites</title>

	<para>This document is very technical in nature, so background
	  knowledge is required.  It is assumed that you are familiar with
	  the TCP/IP network protocol, and in particular, network and node
	  addressing, network address masks, subnetting, routing, and
	  routing protocols, such as RIP.  Configuring SLIP services on a

	  protocol.</para>

	<para>It is further assumed that you have already setup your
	  modem(s) and configured the appropriate system files to allow
	  logins through your modems.  If you have not prepared your

	<title>Quick Overview</title>

	<para>In its typical configuration, using FreeBSD as a SLIP server
	  works as follows:  a SLIP user dials up your FreeBSD SLIP Server
	  system and logs in with a special SLIP login ID that uses
	  <filename>/usr/sbin/sliplogin</filename> as the special user's
	  shell.  The <command>sliplogin</command> program browses the
	  file <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> to find a
	  matching line for the special user, and if it finds a match,
	  connects the serial line to an available SLIP interface and then
	  runs the shell script
	  <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> to configure the
	  SLIP interface.</para>

        <sect4>
	  <title>An Example of a SLIP Server Login</title>

	  <para>For example, if a SLIP user ID were
	    <username>Shelmerg</username>, <username>Shelmerg</username>'s
	    entry in <filename>/etc/master.passwd</filename> would look
	    something like this (except it would be all on one
	    line):</para>

	  <programlisting>
Shelmerg:password:1964:89::0:0:Guy Helmer - SLIP:/usr/users/Shelmerg:/usr/sbin/sliplogin</programlisting>

	  <para>When <username>Shelmerg</username> logs in,
	    <command>sliplogin</command> will search
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> for a line that
	    had a matching user ID; for example, there may be a line in
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> that
	    reads:</para>

	  <programlisting>
Shelmerg        dc-slip sl-helmer       0xfffffc00		  autocomp</programlisting>

	  <para><command>sliplogin</command> will find that matching line,
	    hook the serial line into the next available SLIP interface,
	    and then execute <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename>
	    like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>
/etc/sliphome/slip.login 0 19200 Shelmerg dc-slip sl-helmer 0xfffffc00 autocomp</programlisting>

	  <para>If all goes well,
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> will issue an
	    <command>ifconfig</command> for the SLIP interface to which
	    <command>sliplogin</command> attached itself (slip interface
	    0,in the above example, which was the first parameter in the
	    list given to <filename>slip.login</filename>) to set the
	    local IP address (<hostid>dc-slip</hostid>), remote IP address
	    (<hostid>sl-helmer</hostid>), network mask for the SLIP
	    interface (<hostid role="netmask">0xfffffc00</hostid>), and
	    any additional flags (<literal>autocomp</literal>).  If
	    something goes wrong, <command>sliplogin</command> usually
	    logs good informational messages via the
	    <literal>daemon</literal> syslog facility, which usually goes
	    into <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> (see the manual
	    pages for &man.syslogd.8; and &man.syslog.conf.5; and perhaps
	    check <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> to see to which
	    files <command>syslogd</command> is logging).</para>

	<title>Kernel Configuration</title>

	<para>FreeBSD's default kernels usually come with two SLIP
	  interfaces defined (<devicename>sl0</devicename> and
	  <devicename>sl1</devicename>); you can use <command>netstat
	  -i</command> to see whether these interfaces are defined in your
	  kernel.</para>

	<para>Sample output from <command>netstat -i</command>:</para>

	<screen>Name  Mtu   Network     Address            Ipkts Ierrs    Opkts Oerrs  Coll

	<para>The <devicename>sl0</devicename> and
	  <devicename>sl1</devicename> interfaces shown in
	  <command>netstat -i</command>'s output indicate that there are
	  two SLIP interfaces built into the kernel.  (The asterisks after
	  the <literal>sl0</literal> and <literal>sl1</literal> indicate
	  that the interfaces are <quote>down</quote>.)</para>

	<para>However, FreeBSD's default kernels do not come configured
	  to forward packets (ie, your FreeBSD machine will not act as a
	  router) due to Internet RFC requirements for Internet hosts (see
	  RFCs 1009 [Requirements for Internet Gateways], 1122
	  [Requirements for Internet Hosts &mdash; Communication Layers],
	  and perhaps 1127 [A Perspective on the Host Requirements RFCs]),
	  so if you want your FreeBSD SLIP Server to act as a router, you
	  will have to edit the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file and
	  change the setting of the <literal>gateway_enable</literal> variable to
	  <option>YES</option>.</para>
 
	<para>You will then need to reboot for the new settings to take
	  effect.</para>

	<para>You will notice that near the end of the default kernel
	  configuration file (<filename>/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC</filename>)
	  is a line that reads:</para>

	<programlisting>
pseudo-device sl 2</programlisting>

	<para>This is the line that defines the number of SLIP devices
	  available in the kernel; the number at the end of the line is
	  the maximum number of SLIP connections that may be operating
	  simultaneously.</para>

	<para>Please refer to <link linkend="kernelconfig">Configuring the
	  FreeBSD Kernel</link> for help in reconfiguring your
	  kernel.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Sliplogin Configuration</title>

	<para>As mentioned earlier, there are three files in the
	  <filename>/etc/sliphome</filename> directory that are part of
	  the configuration for <filename>/usr/sbin/sliplogin</filename>
	  (see &man.sliplogin.8; for the actual manual page for
	  <command>sliplogin</command>): <filename>slip.hosts</filename>,
	  which defines the SLIP users &amp; their associated IP
	  addresses; <filename>slip.login</filename>, which usually just
	  configures the SLIP interface; and (optionally)
	  <filename>slip.logout</filename>, which undoes
	  <filename>slip.login</filename>'s effects when the serial
	  connection is terminated.</para>

        <sect4>
	  <title><filename>slip.hosts</filename> Configuration</title>

	  <para><filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> contains
	    lines which have at least four items, separated by
	    whitespace:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>SLIP user's login ID</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Local address (local to the SLIP server) of the SLIP

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Network mask</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>The local and remote addresses may be host names (resolved
	    to IP addresses by <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> or by the
	    domain name service, depending on your specifications in
	    <filename>/etc/host.conf</filename>), and I believe the
	    network mask may be a name that can be resolved by a lookup
	    into <filename>/etc/networks</filename>.  On a sample system,
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.hosts</filename> looks like
	    this:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#

#
Shelmerg  dc-slip       sl-helmerg      0xfffffc00      autocomp</programlisting>

	  <para>At the end of the line is one or more of the
	    options.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><option>normal</option> &mdash; no header

		(so any <quote>ping</quote> packets will be dropped instead
		of using up your bandwidth)</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Note that <command>sliplogin</command> under early releases
	    of FreeBSD 2 ignored the options that FreeBSD 1.x recognized,
	    so the options <option>normal</option>,
	    <option>compress</option>, <option>autocomp</option>, and
	    <option>noicmp</option> had no effect until support was added
	    in FreeBSD 2.2 (unless your <filename>slip.login</filename>
	    script included code to make use of the flags).</para>

	  <para>Your choice of local and remote addresses for your SLIP
	    links depends on whether you are going to dedicate a TCP/IP
	    subnet or if you are going to use <quote>proxy ARP</quote> on
	    your SLIP server (it is not <quote>true</quote> proxy ARP, but
	    that is the terminology used in this document to describe it).
	    If you are not sure which method to select or how to assign IP
	    addresses, please refer to the TCP/IP books referenced in the
	    <link linkend="slips-prereqs">slips-prereqs</link> section
	    and/or consult your IP network manager.</para>

	  <para>If you are going to use a separate subnet for your SLIP
	    clients, you will need to allocate the subnet number out of
	    your assigned IP network number and assign each of your SLIP
	    client's IP numbers out of that subnet.  Then, you will
	    probably either need to configure a static route to the SLIP
	    subnet via your SLIP server on your nearest IP router, or
	    install <command>gated</command> on your FreeBSD SLIP server
	    and configure it to talk the appropriate routing protocols to
	    your other routers to inform them about your SLIP server's
	    route to the SLIP subnet.</para>

	  <para>Otherwise, if you will use the <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    method, you will need to assign your SLIP client's IP
	    addresses out of your SLIP server's Ethernet subnet, and you
	    will also need to adjust your
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> and
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename> scripts to use
	    &man.arp.8; to manage the proxy-ARP entries in the SLIP

	  <title><filename>slip.login</filename> Configuration</title>

	  <para>The typical <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename>
	    file looks like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh -
#
#       @(#)slip.login  5.1 (Berkeley) 7/1/90

#
# generic login file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with

#
/sbin/ifconfig sl$1 inet $4 $5 netmask $6</programlisting>

	  <para>This <filename>slip.login</filename> file merely
	    <command>ifconfig</command>'s the appropriate SLIP interface
	    with the local and remote addresses and network mask of the
	    SLIP interface.</para>

	  <para>If you have decided to use the <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    method (instead of using a separate subnet for your SLIP
	    clients), your <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename>
	    file will need to look something like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh -
#
#       @(#)slip.login  5.1 (Berkeley) 7/1/90

#
# generic login file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with

# Answer ARP requests for the SLIP client with our Ethernet addr
/usr/sbin/arp -s $5 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub</programlisting>

	  <para>The additional line in this
	    <filename>slip.login</filename>, <command>arp -s
	    &#36;5 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub</command>, creates an ARP entry
	    in the SLIP server's ARP table.  This ARP entry causes the
	    SLIP server to respond with the SLIP server's Ethernet MAC
	    address whenever a another IP node on the Ethernet asks to
	    speak to the SLIP client's IP address.</para>

	  <para>When using the example above, be sure to replace the
	    Ethernet MAC address (<hostid
	    role="mac">00:11:22:33:44:55</hostid>) with the MAC address of
	    your system's Ethernet card, or your <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    will definitely not work!  You can discover your SLIP server's
	    Ethernet MAC address by looking at the results of running
	    <command>netstat -i</command>; the second line of the output
	    should look something like:</para>

	  <screen>ed0   1500  &lt;Link&gt;0.2.c1.28.5f.4a         191923	0   129457     0   116</screen>

	  <para>This indicates that this particular system's Ethernet MAC
	    address is <hostid role="mac">00:02:c1:28:5f:4a</hostid>
	    &mdash; the periods in the Ethernet MAC address given by
	    <command>netstat -i</command> must be changed to colons and
	    leading zeros should be added to each single-digit hexadecimal
	    number to convert the address into the form that &man.arp.8;
	    desires; see the manual page on &man.arp.8; for complete
	    information on usage.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>When you create
	      <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.login</filename> and
	      <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename>, the
	      <quote>execute</quote> bit (ie, <command>chmod 755
	      /etc/sliphome/slip.login /etc/sliphome/slip.logout</command>)
	      must be set, or <command>sliplogin</command> will be unable
	      to execute it.</para>
	  </note>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title><filename>slip.logout</filename> Configuration</title>

	  <para><filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename> is not
	    strictly needed (unless you are implementing <quote>proxy
	    ARP</quote>), but if you decide to create it, this is an
	    example of a basic
	    <filename>slip.logout</filename> script:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh -
#
#       slip.logout

#
# logout file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
# the parameters:
#      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
#   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
#
/sbin/ifconfig sl$1 down</programlisting>

	  <para>If you are using <quote>proxy ARP</quote>, you will want to
	    have <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename> remove the
	    ARP entry for the SLIP client:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh -
#
#       @(#)slip.logout

#
# logout file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
# the parameters:
#      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
#   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
#
/sbin/ifconfig sl$1 down
# Quit answering ARP requests for the SLIP client
/usr/sbin/arp -d $5</programlisting>

	  <para>The <command>arp -d &#36;5</command> removes the ARP entry
	    that the <quote>proxy ARP</quote>
	    <filename>slip.login</filename> added when the SLIP client
	    logged in.</para>

	  <para>It bears repeating: make sure
	    <filename>/etc/sliphome/slip.logout</filename> has the execute
	    bit set for after you create it (ie, <command>chmod 755
	    /etc/sliphome/slip.logout</command>).</para>

	<title>Routing Considerations</title>

	<para>If you are not using the <quote>proxy ARP</quote> method for
	  routing packets between your SLIP clients and the rest of your
	  network (and perhaps the Internet), you will probably either
	  have to add static routes to your closest default router(s) to
	  route your SLIP client subnet via your SLIP server, or you will
	  probably need to install and configure <command>gated</command>
	  on your FreeBSD SLIP server so that it will tell your routers
	  via appropriate routing protocols about your SLIP subnet.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Static Routes</title>

	  <para>Adding static routes to your nearest default routers can
	    be troublesome (or impossible, if you do not have authority to
	    do so...).  If you have a multiple-router network in your
	    organization, some routers, such as Cisco and Proteon, may
	    not only need to be configured with the static route to the
	    SLIP subnet, but also need to be told which static routes to
	    tell other routers about, so some expertise and
	    troubleshooting/tweaking may be necessary to get
	    static-route-based routing to work.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Running <command>gated</command></title>

	  <para>An alternative to the headaches of static routes is to
	    install <command>gated</command> on your FreeBSD SLIP server
	    and configure it to use the appropriate routing protocols
	    (RIP/OSPF/BGP/EGP) to tell other routers about your SLIP
	    subnet.  You can use <command>gated</command> from the <link
	    linkend="ports">ports collection</link> or retrieve and build
	    it yourself from <ulink
	    url="ftp://ftp.gated.merit.edu/research.and.development/gated/">the
	    GateD anonymous ftp site</ulink>; I believe the current version
	    as of this writing is
	    <filename>gated-R3_5Alpha_8.tar.Z</filename>, which includes
	    support for FreeBSD <quote>out-of-the-box</quote>.  Complete
	    information and documentation on <command>gated</command> is
	    available on the Web starting at <ulink
	    url="http://www.gated.merit.edu/">the Merit GateD
	    Consortium</ulink>.  Compile and install it, and then write a
	    <filename>/etc/gated.conf</filename> file to configure your
	    gated; here is a sample, similar to what the author used on a
	    FreeBSD SLIP server:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#
# gated configuration file for dc.dsu.edu; for gated version 3.5alpha5
# Only broadcast RIP information for xxx.xxx.yy out the ed Ethernet interface
#
#
# tracing options
#
traceoptions "/var/tmp/gated.output" replace size 100k files 2 general ;

rip yes {
  interface sl noripout noripin ;
  interface ed ripin ripout version 1 ;
  traceoptions route ;
} ;

#
# Turn on a bunch of tracing info for the interface to the kernel:
kernel {
  traceoptions remnants request routes info interface ;
} ;

#
# Propagate the route to xxx.xxx.yy out the Ethernet interface via RIP
#

export proto rip interface ed {
  proto direct {
      <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable> mask 255.255.252.0 metric 1; # SLIP connections
  } ;
} ;

#
# Accept routes from RIP via ed Ethernet interfaces
	      
import proto rip interface ed {
  all ;
} ;</programlisting>

	  <para>The above sample <filename>gated.conf</filename> file
	    broadcasts routing information regarding the SLIP subnet
	    <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable> via RIP onto the
	    Ethernet; if you are using a different Ethernet driver than
	    the <devicename>ed</devicename> driver, you will need to
	    change the references to the <devicename>ed</devicename>
	    interface appropriately.  This sample file also sets up
	    tracing to <filename>/var/tmp/gated.output</filename> for
	    debugging <command>gated</command>'s activity; you can
	    certainly turn off the tracing options if
	    <command>gated</command> works OK for you.  You will need to
	    change the <replaceable>xxx.xxx.yy</replaceable>'s into the
	    network address of your own SLIP subnet (be sure to change the
	    net mask in the <literal>proto direct</literal> clause as
	    well).</para>

	  <para>When you get <command>gated</command> built and installed
	    and create a configuration file for it, you will need to run
	    <command>gated</command> in place of <command>routed</command>
	    on your FreeBSD system; change the
	    <filename>routed/gated</filename> startup parameters in
	    <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> as appropriate for your
	    system.  Please see the manual page for
	    <command>gated</command> for information on
	    <command>gated</command>'s command-line parameters.</para>

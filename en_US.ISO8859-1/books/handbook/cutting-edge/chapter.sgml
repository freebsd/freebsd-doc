  <title>Updating and Upgrading &os;</title>

  <sect1 id="updating-upgrading-synopsis">
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>&os; is under constant development between releases.  Some people
      prefer to use the officially released versions, while others prefer
      to keep in sync with the latest developments.  However, even official
      releases are often updated with security and other critical fixes.
      Regardless of the version used, &os; provides all necessary tools
      to keep your system updated, and also allows for easy upgrades between
      versions.
      This chapter will help you decide if you want to track the
      development system, or stick with one of the released
      versions.  The basic tools for keeping your system up to date are
      also presented.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

	the graphical <command>cvsup</command> client, you can just install
	the port <filename>net/cvsup-without-gui</filename>).
	You may wish to substitute this
	with &man.csup.1;, which is part of the base system.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>freebsd-update</primary>
      <see>updating-upgrading</see>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Applying security patches is an important part of maintaining
      computer software, especially the operating system.  For the
      longest time on &os; this process was not an easy one.  Patches
      had to be applied to the source code, the code rebuilt into
      binaries, and then the binaries had to be re-installed.</para>

    <para>This is no longer the case as &os; now includes a utility
      simply called <command>freebsd-update</command>.  This utility
      provides two separate functions.  First, it allows for binary
      security and errata updates to be applied to the &os; base system
      without the build and install requirements.  Second, the utility
      supports minor and major release upgrades.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Binary updates are available for all architectures and
	releases currently supported by the security team.
	Before updating to a new release, the current
	release announcements should be reviewed as they may contain
	important information pertinent to the desired release.  These
	announcements may be viewed at the following link:
	<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If a <command>crontab</command> utilizing the features
      of <command>freebsd-update</command> exists, it must be
      disabled before the following operation is started.</para>

    <sect2 id="freebsdupdate-config-file">
      <title>The Configuration File</title>

      <para>Some users may wish to tweak the default configuration file
	in <filename>/etc/freebsd-update.conf</filename>,
	allowing better control of the process.  The options are
	very well documented, but the following few may require a
	bit more explanation:</para>

      <programlisting># Components of the base system which should be kept updated.
Components src world kernel</programlisting>

      <para>This parameter controls what parts of &os; will be kept
	up to date.  The default is to update the source code, the
	entire base system, and the kernel.  Components are the
	same as those available during the install, for instance,
	adding <literal>world/games</literal> here would allow game patches to be
	applied.  Using <literal>src/bin</literal> would allow the source code in
	<filename class="directory">src/bin</filename> to be
	updated.</para>

      <para>The best option is to leave this at the default as
	changing it to include specific items will require the user
	to list every item they prefer to be updated.  This could
	have disastrous consequences as source code and binaries may
	become out of sync.</para>

      <programlisting># Paths which start with anything matching an entry in an IgnorePaths
# statement will be ignored.
IgnorePaths</programlisting>

      <para>Add paths, such as
	<filename class="directory">/bin</filename> or
	<filename class="directory">/sbin</filename> to leave these
	specific directories untouched during the update
	process.  This option may be used to prevent
	<command>freebsd-update</command> from overwriting local
	modifications.</para>

      <programlisting># Paths which start with anything matching an entry in an UpdateIfUnmodified
# statement will only be updated if the contents of the file have not been
# modified by the user (unless changes are merged; see below).
UpdateIfUnmodified /etc/ /var/ /root/ /.cshrc /.profile</programlisting>

      <para>Update configuration files in the specified directories
	only if they have not been modified.  Any changes made by the
	user will invalidate the automatic updating of these files.
	There is another option,
	<literal>KeepModifiedMetadata</literal>, which will instruct
	<command>freebsd-update</command> to save the changes during
	the merge.</para>

      <programlisting># When upgrading to a new &os; release, files which match MergeChanges
# will have any local changes merged into the version from the new release.
MergeChanges /etc/ /var/named/etc/</programlisting>

      <para>List of directories with configuration files that
	<command>freebsd-update</command> should attempt merges in.
	The file merge process is a series of &man.diff.1; patches
	similar to &man.mergemaster.8; with fewer options, the merges
	are either accepted, open an editor, or
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will abort.  When in doubt,
	backup <filename class="directory">/etc</filename> and just
	accept the merges. See <xref linkend="mergemaster"> for more
	information about the <command>mergemaster</command>
	command.</para>

      <programlisting># Directory in which to store downloaded updates and temporary
# files used by &os; Update.
# WorkDir /var/db/freebsd-update</programlisting>

      <para>This directory is where all patches and temporary
	files will be placed.  In cases where the user is doing
	a version upgrade, this location should have a least a
	gigabyte of disk space available.</para>

      <programlisting># When upgrading between releases, should the list of Components be
# read strictly (StrictComponents yes) or merely as a list of components
# which *might* be installed of which &os; Update should figure out
# which actually are installed and upgrade those (StrictComponents no)?
# StrictComponents no</programlisting>

      <para>When set to <literal>yes</literal>,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will assume that the
	<literal>Components</literal> list is complete and will not
	attempt to make changes outside of the list.  Effectively,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will attempt to update
	every file which belongs to the <literal>Components</literal>
	list.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="freebsdupdate-security-patches">
      <title>Security Patches</title>

      <para>Security patches are stored on a remote machine and
	may be downloaded and installed using the following
	command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update fetch</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update install</userinput></screen>

      <para>If any kernel patches have been applied the system will
	need a reboot.  If all went well the system should be patched
	and <command>freebsd-update</command> may be run as a nightly
	&man.cron.8; job.  An entry in <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>
	would be sufficient to accomplish this task:</para>

      <programlisting>@daily                                  root    freebsd-update cron</programlisting>

      <para>This entry states that once every day, the
	<command>freebsd-update</command> utility will be run.  In this way,
	using the <option>cron</option> argument,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will only check if updates
	exist.  If patches exist, they will automatically be downloaded
	to the local disk but not applied.  The
	<username>root</username> user will be sent an email so they
	may install them manually.</para>

      <para>If anything went wrong, <command>freebsd-update</command>
	has the ability to roll back the last set of changes with
	the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update rollback</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once complete, the system should be restarted if the kernel
	or any kernel modules were modified.  This will allow &os; to
	load the new binaries into memory.</para>

      <para>The <command>freebsd-update</command> utility can
	automatically update the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel only.
	If a custom kernel is in use, it will have to be rebuilt and
	reinstalled after <command>freebsd-update</command> finishes
	installing the rest of the updates.  However,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will detect and update the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel in <filename
	  class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename> (if it exists), even if
	it is not the current (running) kernel of the system.</para>

      <note>
	<para>It is a good idea to always keep a copy of the
	  <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel in <filename
	    class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename>.  It will be helpful
	  in diagnosing a variety of problems, and in performing version
	  upgrades using <command>freebsd-update</command> as described in
	  <xref linkend="freebsdupdate-upgrade">.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Unless the default configuration in
	<filename>/etc/freebsd-update.conf</filename> has been changed,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will install the updated kernel
	sources along with the rest of the updates.  Rebuilding and
	reinstalling your new custom kernel can then be performed in the usual
	way.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The updates distributed via <command>freebsd-update</command>,
	  do not always involve the kernel.  It will not be necessary to
	  rebuild your custom kernel if the kernel sources have not been
	  modified by the execution of
	  <command>freebsd-update install</command>.  However,
	  <command>freebsd-update</command> will always update the
	  <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/newvers.sh</filename> file.  The current
	  patch level (as indicated by the <literal>-p</literal> number
	  reported by <command>uname -r</command>) is
	  obtained from this file.  Rebuilding your custom kernel, even if
	  nothing else changed, will allow &man.uname.1; to accurately report
	  the current patch level of the system.  This is particularly
	  helpful when maintaining multiple systems, as it allows for a quick
	  assessment of the updates installed in each one.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="freebsdupdate-upgrade">
      <title>Major and Minor Upgrades</title>

      <para>This process will remove old object files and
	libraries which will break most third party applications.
	It is recommended that all installed ports either be removed
	and re-installed or upgraded later using the
	<filename role="package">ports-mgmt/portupgrade</filename>
	utility.  Most users will want to run a test build using
	the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -af</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will ensure everything will be re-installed
	correctly.  Note that setting the
	<makevar>BATCH</makevar> environment variable to
	<literal>yes</literal> will answer <literal>yes</literal> to
	any prompts during this process, removing the need for
	manual intervention during the build process.</para>

      <para>If a custom kernel is in use, the upgrade process is slightly
	more involved.  A copy of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel is
	needed, and it should be placed in <filename
	  class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename>.  If the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel is not already present in the
	system, it may be obtained using one of the following methods:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If a custom kernel has only been built once, the kernel in
	    <filename class="directory">/boot/kernel.old</filename> is
	    actually the <filename>GENERIC</filename> one.  Simply rename this
	    directory to
	    <filename class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Assuming physical access to the machine is possible, a copy
	    of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel can be installed from
	    the CD-ROM media.  Insert your installation disc and use the
	    following commands:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /cdrom</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /cdrom/<replaceable>X.Y-RELEASE</replaceable>/kernels</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./install.sh GENERIC</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Replace <filename
	      class="directory"><replaceable>X.Y-RELEASE</replaceable></filename>
	    with the actual version of the release you are using.  The
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel will be installed in <filename
	      class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename> by default.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Failing all the above, the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel
	    may be rebuilt and installed from the sources:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>env DESTDIR=/boot/GENERIC make kernel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/GENERIC/boot/kernel/* /boot/GENERIC</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>rm -rf /boot/GENERIC/boot</userinput></screen>

	  <para>For this kernel to be picked up as <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	    by <command>freebsd-update</command>, the
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file must not have been
	    modified in any way.  It is also suggested that it is built
	    without any other special options (preferably with an empty
	    <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>).</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Rebooting to the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel is not
	required at this stage.</para>

      <para>Major and minor version updates may be performed by
	providing <command>freebsd-update</command> with a release
	version target, for example, the following command will
	update to &os;&nbsp;8.1:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update -r 8.1-RELEASE upgrade</userinput></screen>

      <para>After the command has been received,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will evaluate the
	configuration file and current system in an attempt to gather
	the information necessary to update the system.  A screen
	listing will display what components have been detected and
	what components have not been detected.  For example:</para>

      <screen>Looking up update.FreeBSD.org mirrors... 1 mirrors found.
Fetching metadata signature for 8.0-RELEASE from update1.FreeBSD.org... done.
Fetching metadata index... done.
Inspecting system... done.

The following components of FreeBSD seem to be installed:
kernel/smp src/base src/bin src/contrib src/crypto src/etc src/games
src/gnu src/include src/krb5 src/lib src/libexec src/release src/rescue
src/sbin src/secure src/share src/sys src/tools src/ubin src/usbin
world/base world/info world/lib32 world/manpages

The following components of FreeBSD do not seem to be installed:
kernel/generic world/catpages world/dict world/doc world/games
world/proflibs

Does this look reasonable (y/n)? y</screen>

      <para>At this point, <command>freebsd-update</command> will
	attempt to download all files required for the upgrade.  In
	some cases, the user may be prompted with questions regarding
	what to install or how to proceed.</para>

      <para>When using a custom kernel, the above step will produce a warning
	similar to the following:</para>

      <screen>WARNING: This system is running a "<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable>" kernel, which is not a
kernel configuration distributed as part of FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE.
This kernel will not be updated: you MUST update the kernel manually
before running "/usr/sbin/freebsd-update install"</screen>

      <para>This warning may be safely ignored at this point.  The updated
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel will be used as an intermediate
	step in the upgrade process.</para>

      <para>After all patches have been downloaded to the local
	system, they will then be applied.  This process may take
	a while depending on the speed and workload of the machine.
	Configuration files will then be merged&nbsp;&mdash; this part
	of the process requires some user intervention as a file may be
	merged or an editor may appear on screen for a manual merge.
	The results of every successful merge will be shown to the user
	as the process continues.  A failed or ignored merge will cause
	the process to abort.  Users may wish to make a backup of
	<filename class="directory">/etc</filename> and manually merge
	important files, such as <filename>master.passwd</filename>
	or <filename>group</filename> at a later time.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The system is not being altered yet, all patching and
	  merging is happening in another directory.  When all
	  patches have been applied successfully, all configuration
	  files have been merged and it seems the process will go
	  smoothly, the changes will need to be committed by the
	  user.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Once this process is complete, the upgrade may be committed
	to disk using the following command.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update install</userinput></screen>

      <para>The kernel and kernel modules will be patched first.  At
	this point the  machine must be rebooted.  If the system was running
	with a custom kernel, use the &man.nextboot.8; command to set the
	kernel for the next boot to <filename
	  class="directory">/boot/GENERIC</filename> (which was
	updated):</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>nextboot -k GENERIC</userinput></screen>

      <warning>
	<para>Before rebooting with the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel,
	  make sure it contains all drivers required for your system to boot
	  properly (and connect to the network, if the machine that is being
	  updated is accessed remotely).  In particular, if the previously
	  running custom kernel contained built-in functionality usually
	  provided by kernel modules, make sure to temporarily load these
	  modules into the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel using the
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> facility.  You may also wish
	  to disable non-essential services, disk and network mounts, etc.
	  until the upgrade process is complete.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The machine should now be restarted with the updated kernel:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once the system has come back online,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will need to be started
	again.  The state of the process has been saved and thus,
	<command>freebsd-update</command> will not start from the
	beginning, but will remove all old shared libraries and object
	files.  To continue to this stage, issue the following
	command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update install</userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>Depending on whether any libraries version numbers got
	  bumped, there may only be two install phases instead of
	  three.</para>
      </note>

      <para>All third party software will now need to be rebuilt and
	re-installed.  This is required as installed software may
	depend on libraries which have been removed during the upgrade
	process.  The
	<filename role="package">ports-mgmt/portupgrade</filename>
	command may be used to automate this process.  The following
	commands may be used to begin this process:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -f ruby</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -f ruby18-bdb</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db /usr/ports/INDEX-*.db</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>portupgrade -af</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once this has completed, finish the upgrade process with a
	final call to <command>freebsd-update</command>.  Issue the
	following command to tie up all loose ends in the upgrade
	process:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update install</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel was temporarily used,
	this is the time to build and install a new custom kernel in the
	usual way.</para>

      <para>Reboot the machine into the new &os; version.  The process
	is complete.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="freebsdupdate-system-comparison">
      <title>System State Comparison</title>

      <para>The <command>freebsd-update</command> utility may be used
	to test the state of the installed &os; version against a
	known good copy.  This option evaluates the current version
	of system utilities, libraries, and configuration files.
	To begin the comparison, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>freebsd-update IDS &gt;&gt; outfile.ids</userinput></screen>

      <warning>
	<para>While the command name is <acronym>IDS</acronym> it should
	  in no way be a replacement for an intrusion detection system
	  such as <filename role="package">security/snort</filename>.
	  As <command>freebsd-update</command> stores data on disk, the
	  possibility of tampering is evident.  While this possibility
	  may be reduced by using the
	  <varname>kern.securelevel</varname> setting and storing the
	  <command>freebsd-update</command> data on a read only file
	  system when not in use, a better solution would be to
	  compare the system against a secure disk, such as a
	  <acronym>DVD</acronym> or securely stored external
	  <acronym>USB</acronym> disk device.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The system will now be inspected, and a list of files
	along with their &man.sha256.1; hash values, both the known value
	in the release and the current installed value, will be printed.  This is why
	the output has been sent to the
	<filename>outfile.ids</filename> file.  It scrolls by too
	quickly for eye comparisons, and soon it fills up the console
	buffer.</para>

      <para>These lines are also extremely long, but the output format
	may be parsed quite easily.  For instance, to obtain a list of
	all files different from those in the release, issue the
	following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cat outfile.ids | awk '{ print $1 }' | more</userinput>
/etc/master.passwd
/etc/motd
/etc/passwd
/etc/pf.conf</screen>

      <para>This output has been truncated, many more files exist.
	Some of these files have natural modifications, the
	<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> has been modified because
	users have been added to the system.  In some cases, there
	may be other files, such as kernel modules, which differ
	as <command>freebsd-update</command> may have updated them.
	To exclude specific files or directories, add them to the
	<literal>IDSIgnorePaths</literal> option in
	<filename>/etc/freebsd-update.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>This system may be used as part of an elaborate upgrade
	method, aside from the previously discussed version.</para>

    <title>Portsnap: A Ports Collection Update Tool</title>

      <see>Updating and Upgrading</see>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The base system of &os; includes a utility for updating
      the Ports Collection too: the &man.portsnap.8; utility.  Upon
      execution, it will connect to a remote site, verify the secure
      key, and download a new copy of the Ports Collection.  The key
      is used to verify the integrity of all downloaded files, ensuring
      they have not been modified in-flight.  To download the latest
      Ports Collection files, issue the following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portsnap fetch</userinput>
Looking up portsnap.FreeBSD.org mirrors... 3 mirrors found.
Fetching snapshot tag from portsnap1.FreeBSD.org... done.
Fetching snapshot metadata... done.
Updating from Wed Aug  6 18:00:22 EDT 2008 to Sat Aug 30 20:24:11 EDT 2008.
Fetching 3 metadata patches.. done.
Applying metadata patches... done.
Fetching 3 metadata files... done.
Fetching 90 patches.....10....20....30....40....50....60....70....80....90. done.
Applying patches... done.
Fetching 133 new ports or files... done.</screen>

    <para>What this example shows is that &man.portsnap.8;
      has found and verified
      several patches to the current ports data.  This also indicates
      that the utility was run previously, if it was a first time
      run, the collection would have simply been downloaded.</para>

    <para>When &man.portsnap.8; successfully completes
      a <command>fetch</command> operation, the Ports Collection and
      subsequent patches exist on the local system that have passed
      verification.  The first time <command>portsnap</command> is executed,
      you have to use <literal>extract</literal> to install the
      downloaded files:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portsnap extract</userinput>
/usr/ports/.cvsignore
/usr/ports/CHANGES
/usr/ports/COPYRIGHT
/usr/ports/GIDs
/usr/ports/KNOBS
/usr/ports/LEGAL
/usr/ports/MOVED
/usr/ports/Makefile
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.apache.mk
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.autotools.mk
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.cmake.mk
<replaceable>...</replaceable></screen>

    <para>To update an already installed Ports Collection use the command
      <command>portsnap update</command>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portsnap update</userinput></screen>

    <para>The process is now complete, and applications may be
      installed or upgraded using the updated Ports Collection.</para>

    <para>The <literal>fetch</literal> and <literal>extract</literal> or
      <literal>update</literal> operations may be run consecutively, as
      shown in the following example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>portsnap fetch update</userinput></screen>

    <para>This command will download the latest version of the
      Ports Collection and update your local version under
      <filename class="directory">/usr/ports</filename>.</para>

      <para>Rebuilding the &os; documentation from source requires a

      <para>The initial download of the documentation sources may take a

      </indexterm>

      <para>In the previous section, we have presented a method for
	updating the &os; documentation from sources.  Source based
	updates may not be feasible or practical for all &os; systems
	though.  Building the documentation sources requires a fairly
	large collection of tools and utilities, the
	<emphasis>documentation toolchain</emphasis>, a certain level of
	familiarity with <application>CVS</application> and source
	checkouts from a repository, and a few manual steps to build the
	checked out sources.  In this section, we describe an
	alternative way of updating the installed copies of the &os;
	documentation; one that uses the Ports&nbsp;Collection and makes
	it possible to:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Download and install pre-built snaphots of the
	    documentation, without having to locally build anything
	    (eliminating this way the need for an installation of the
	    entire documentation toolchain).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Download the documentation sources and build them
	    through the ports framework (making the checkout and build
	    steps a bit eaiser).</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These two methods of updating the &os; documentation are
	supported by a set of <emphasis>documentation ports</emphasis>,
	updated by the &a.doceng; on a monthly basis.  These are listed
	in the &os; Ports&nbsp;Collection, under the virtual category
	named <ulink
	  url="http://www.freshports.org/docs/">docs</ulink>.</para>

      <sect3 id="doc-ports-install-make">
	<title>Building and Installing Documentation Ports</title>

	<para>The documentation ports use the ports building framework
	  to make documentation builds easier.  They automate the
	  process of checking out the documentation source, running
	  &man.make.1; with the appropriate environment settings and
	  command-line options, and they make the installation or
	  deinstallation of documentation as easy as the installation of
	  any other &os; port or package.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>As an extra feature, when the documentation ports are
	    built locally, they record a dependency to the
	    <emphasis>documentation toolchain</emphasis> ports, so the
	    latter is automatically installed too.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Organization of the documentation ports is as follows:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>There is a <quote>master port</quote>, <filename
		role="package">misc/freebsd-doc-en</filename>, where the
	      documentation port files can be found.  It is the base of
	      all documentation ports.  By default, it builds the
	      English documentation only.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>There is an <quote>all in one port</quote>, <filename
		role="package">misc/freebsd-doc-all</filename>, and it
	      builds and installs all documentation in all available
	      languages.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Finally, there is a <quote>slave port</quote> for
	      each translation, e.g.: <filename
		role="package">misc/freebsd-doc-hu</filename> for the
	      Hungarian-language documents.  All of them depend on the
	      master port and install the translated documentation of
	      the respective language.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>To install a documentation port from source, issue the
	  following commands (as <username>root</username>):</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/misc/freebsd-doc-en</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will build and install the English documentation in
	  split <acronym>HTML</acronym> format (the same as used on <ulink
	    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org"></ulink>) in the <filename

	  directory.</para>

	<sect4 id="doc-ports-options">
	  <title>Common Knobs and Options</title>

	  <para>There are many options for modifying the default

		<note>
		  <para>Notice that the default target directory
		    differs from the directory used by the

	  <para>Here is a brief example on how to use the variables
	    mentioned above to install the Hungarian documentation in

      <sect3 id="doc-ports-install-package">
	<title>Using Documentation Packages</title>

	<para>Building the documentation ports from source, as described
	  in the previous section, requires a local installation of the
	  documentation toolchain and a bit of disk space for the build
	  of the ports.  When resources are not available to install the
	  documentation toolchain, or because the build from sources
	  would take too much disk space, it is still possible to
	  install pre-built snapshots of the documentation ports.</para>

	<para>The &a.doceng; prepares monthly snapshots of the &os;

	  with any of the bundled package tools, like &man.pkg.add.1;,
	  &man.pkg.delete.1;, and so on.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>When binary packages are used, the &os; documentation
	    will be installed in <emphasis>all</emphasis> available

	<para>For example, the following command will install the latest
	  pre-built package of the Hungarian documentation:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r hu-freebsd-doc</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Packages have the following name format that differs
	    from the corresponding port's name:
	    <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>-freebsd-doc</literal>.
	    Here <replaceable>lang</replaceable> is the short format of
	    the language code, i.e. <literal>hu</literal> for

      <para><application>Docsnap</application> is an &man.rsync.1;
	repository for updating installed &os; Documentation in a
	relatively easy and fast way.  A
	<quote><application>Docsnap</application> server</quote> tracks
	the documentation sources, and builds them in HTML format every
	hour.  The <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename>
	is unneeded with <application>Docsnap</application> as only
	patches to the built documentation exist.</para>

      <para>The only requirement for using this technique is
	the <filename role="package">net/rsync</filename> port or
	package.  To add it, use the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r rsync</userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para><application>Docsnap</application> has been originally
	  developed for updating documentation installed
	  to <filename class="directory">/usr/share/doc</filename>, but
	  the following examples could be adapted for other directories
	  as well.  For user directories, it does not require
	  <username>root</username> privileges.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To update the documentation set, issue the following
	command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rsync -rltvz <replaceable>docsnap.sk.FreeBSD.org</replaceable>::docsnap <replaceable>/usr/share/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>There is only one <application>Docsnap</application>
	  server at the moment;
	  the <hostid>docsnap.sk.FreeBSD.org</hostid> shown
	  above.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Do not use the <option>--delete</option> flag here as there
	are some items installed
	into <filename class="directory">/usr/share/doc</filename>
	during <command>make installworld</command>, which would
	accidentally be removed.  To clean up, use this command
	instead:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rsync -rltvz --delete <replaceable>docsnap.sk.FreeBSD.org</replaceable>::docsnap/??_??\.\* <replaceable>/usr/share/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>If a subset of documentation needs to be updated, for
	example, the English documentation only, the following command
	should be used:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rsync -rltvz <replaceable>docsnap.sk.FreeBSD.org</replaceable>::docsnap/en_US.ISO8859-1 <replaceable>/usr/share/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <indexterm><primary>-STABLE</primary></indexterm>

    <para>There are two development branches to FreeBSD: &os.current; and
      &os.stable;.  This section will explain a bit about each and describe
      how to keep your system up-to-date with each respective tree.
      &os.current; will be discussed first, then &os.stable;.</para>

    <sect2 id="current">
      <title>Staying Current with &os;</title>

      <para>As you read this, keep in mind that &os.current; is the
	<quote>bleeding edge</quote> of &os; development.
	&os.current; users are expected to have a high degree of
	technical skill, and should be capable of solving difficult
	system problems on their own.  If you are new to &os;, think
	twice before installing it.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>What Is &os.current;?</title>
	<indexterm><primary>snapshot</primary></indexterm>

	<para>&os.current; is the latest working sources for &os;.
	  This includes work in progress, experimental changes, and
	  transitional mechanisms that might or might not be present
	  in the next official release of the software.  While many
	  &os; developers compile the &os.current; source code daily,
	  there are periods of time when the sources are not
	  buildable.  These problems are resolved as expeditiously as
	  possible, but whether or not &os.current; brings disaster or
	  greatly desired functionality can be a matter of which exact
	  moment you grabbed the source code in!</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Members of the &os; community who are active testers,

	      These are also people who wish to make topical
	      suggestions on changes and the general direction of
	      &os;, and submit patches to implement them.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Those who merely wish to keep an eye on things, or

	<para>&os.stable; is our development branch from which major releases

	  with the general assumption that they have first gone into
	  &os.current; for testing.  This is <emphasis>still</emphasis>
	  a development branch, however, and this means that at any given
	  time, the sources for &os.stable; may or may not be suitable for any
	  particular purpose.  It is simply another engineering development
	  track, not a resource for end-users.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Who Needs &os.stable;?</title>

	<para>If you are interested in tracking or contributing to the
	  FreeBSD development process, especially as it relates to the
	  next <quote>point</quote> release of FreeBSD, then you should
	  consider following &os.stable;.</para>

	<para>While it is true that security fixes also go into the
	  &os.stable; branch, you do not <emphasis>need</emphasis> to
	  track &os.stable; to do this.  Every security advisory for
	  FreeBSD explains how to fix the problem for the releases it
	  affects
	  <footnote><para>That is not quite true.  We can not continue to
	    support old releases of FreeBSD forever, although we do
	    support them for many years.  For a complete description
	    of the current security policy for old releases of
	    FreeBSD, please see <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/security/">http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/</ulink>.</para>
	  </footnote>,
	  and tracking an entire development branch just
	  for security reasons is likely to bring in a lot of unwanted
	  changes as well.</para>

	<para>Although we endeavor to ensure that the &os.stable; branch
	  compiles and runs at all times, this cannot be guaranteed.  In
	  addition, while code is developed in &os.current; before including
	  it in &os.stable;, more people run &os.stable; than &os.current;, so
	  it is inevitable that bugs and corner cases will sometimes be found
	  in &os.stable; that were not apparent in &os.current;.</para>

	<para>For these reasons, we do <emphasis>not</emphasis> recommend that
	  you blindly track &os.stable;, and it is particularly important that
	  you do not update any production servers to &os.stable; without
	  first thoroughly testing the code in your development
	  environment.</para>

	<para>If you do not have the resources to do this then we recommend

    <warning>
      <para>While it is possible to update only parts of your source tree,
	the only supported update procedure is to update the entire tree
	and recompile both userland (i.e., all the programs that run in
	user space, such as those in <filename>/bin</filename> and
	<filename>/sbin</filename>) and kernel sources.  Updating only part

    </warning>

    <indexterm>

    </indexterm>

    <para><application>Anonymous CVS</application> and
      <application>CVSup</application> use the <emphasis>pull</emphasis>
      model of updating sources.  In the case of
      <application>CVSup</application> the user (or a
      <command>cron</command> script) invokes
      the <command>cvsup</command> program, and it interacts with a
      <command>cvsupd</command> server somewhere to bring your files
      up-to-date.  The updates you receive are up-to-the-minute and you
      get them when, and only when, you want them.  You can easily
      restrict your updates to the specific files or directories that are
      of interest to you.  Updates are generated on the fly by the server,
      according to what you have and what you want to have.
      <application>Anonymous CVS</application> is quite a bit more
      simplistic than <application>CVSup</application> in that it is just an
      extension to <application>CVS</application> which allows it to pull
      changes directly from a remote CVS repository.
      <application>CVSup</application> can do this far more efficiently,
      but <application>Anonymous CVS</application> is easier to use.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><application>CTM</application></primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para><application>CTM</application>, on the other hand, does not
      interactively compare the sources you have with those on the master
      archive or otherwise pull them across.  Instead, a script which
      identifies changes in files since its previous run is executed
      several times a day on the master CTM machine, any detected changes
      being compressed, stamped with a sequence-number and encoded for
      transmission over email (in printable ASCII only).  Once received,
      these <quote>CTM deltas</quote> can then be handed to the
      &man.ctm.rmail.1; utility which will automatically decode, verify
      and apply the changes to the user's copy of the sources.  This
      process is far more efficient than <application>CVSup</application>,
      and places less strain on our server resources since it is a
      <emphasis>push</emphasis> rather than a <emphasis>pull</emphasis>
      model.</para>

    <para>There are other trade-offs, of course.  If you inadvertently
      wipe out portions of your archive, <application>CVSup</application>
      will detect and rebuild the damaged portions for you.
      <application>CTM</application> will not do this, and if you wipe some
      portion of your source tree out (and do not have it backed up) then
      you will have to start from scratch (from the most recent CVS
      <quote>base delta</quote>) and rebuild it all with
      <application>CTM</application> or, with
      <application>Anonymous CVS</application>, simply delete the bad bits
      and resync.</para>

    <para>Once you have synchronized your local source tree against a

      <title>Make a Backup</title>

      <para>It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to make a
	backup of your system <emphasis>before</emphasis> you do this.
	While rebuilding the world is (as long as you follow these
	instructions) an easy task to do, there will inevitably be times
	when you make mistakes, or when mistakes made by others in the
	source tree render your system unbootable.</para>

      <para>Make sure you have taken a backup.  And have a fixit floppy or
	bootable CD at hand.  You will probably never have to use it, but it
	is better to be safe than sorry!</para>

      <para>The &os.stable; and &os.current; branches are, by their

	contribute to &os; are human, and mistakes occasionally
	happen.</para>

      <para>Sometimes these mistakes can be quite harmless, just causing
	your system to print a new diagnostic warning.  Or the change may
	be catastrophic, and render your system unbootable or destroy your
	file systems (or worse).</para>

      <para>If problems like these occur, a <quote>heads up</quote> is
	posted to the appropriate mailing list, explaining the nature of

      <title>The Canonical Way to Update Your System</title>

      <para>To update your system, you should check
	<filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> for any pre-buildworld
	steps necessary for your version of the sources and then use the
	procedure outlined here.</para>

      <para>These upgrade steps assume that you are currently using an old
	&os; version, consisting of an old compiler, old kernel, old world and
	old configuration files.  By <quote>world</quote> here we mean the
	core system binaries, libraries and programming files.  The compiler
	is part of <quote>world</quote>, but has a few special concerns.</para>

      <para>We also assume that you have already obtained the sources to a
	newer system.  If the sources available on the particular system are
	old too, see <xref linkend="synching"> for detailed help about
	synchronizing them to a newer version.</para>

      <para>Updating the system from sources is a bit more subtle than it
	might initially seem to be, and the &os; developers have found it
	necessary over the years to change the recommended approach fairly
	dramatically as new kinds of unavoidable dependencies come to light.
	The rest of this section describes the rationale behind the currently
	recommended upgrade sequence.</para>

      <para>Any successful update sequence must deal with the following
	issues:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The old compiler might not be able to compile the new
	    kernel.  (Old compilers sometimes have bugs.)  So, the new
	    kernel should be built with the new compiler.  In particular,
	    the new compiler must be built before the new kernel is built.
	    This does not necessarily mean that the new compiler must
	    be <emphasis>installed</emphasis> before building the new
	    kernel.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The new world might rely on new kernel features.  So, the
	    new kernel must be installed before the new world is
	    installed.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These first two issues are the basis for the
	core <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget>,
	<maketarget>buildkernel</maketarget>,
	<maketarget>installkernel</maketarget>,
	<maketarget>installworld</maketarget> sequence that we describe in
	the following paragraphs.  This is not an exhaustive list of all the
	reasons why you should prefer the currently recommended upgrade
	process.  Some of the less obvious ones are listed below:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The old world might not run correctly on the new kernel, so
	    you must install the new world immediately upon installing the
	    new kernel.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Some configuration changes must be done before the new world
	    is installed, but others might break the old world.  Hence, two
	    different configuration upgrade steps are generally
	    needed.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>For the most part, the update process only replaces or adds
	    files; existing old files are not deleted.  In a few cases, this
	    can cause problems.  As a result, the update procedure will
	    sometimes specify certain files that should be manually deleted
	    at certain steps.  This may or may not be automated in the
	    future.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These concerns have led to the following recommended sequence.
	Note that the detailed sequence for particular updates may require
	additional steps, but this core process should remain unchanged for
	some time:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><command>make <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget></command></para>

	  <para>This first compiles the new compiler and a few related
	    tools, then uses the new compiler to compile the rest of the new
	    world.  The result ends up
	    in <filename class="directory">/usr/obj</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><command>make <maketarget>buildkernel</maketarget></command></para>

	  <para>Unlike the older approach, using &man.config.8; and
	    &man.make.1;, this uses the <emphasis>new</emphasis> compiler
	    residing in <filename class="directory">/usr/obj</filename>.
	    This protects you against compiler-kernel mismatches.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><command>make <maketarget>installkernel</maketarget></command></para>

	  <para>Place the new kernel and kernel modules onto the disk,
	    making it possible to boot with the newly updated kernel.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Reboot into single user mode.</para>

	  <para>Single user mode minimizes problems from updating software
	    that's already running.  It also minimizes any problems from
	    running the old world on a new kernel.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><command>mergemaster <option>-p</option></command></para>

	  <para>This does some initial configuration file updates in
	    preparation for the new world.  For instance it may add new user
	    groups to the system, or new user names to the password database.
	    This is often necessary when new groups or special system-user
	    accounts have been added since the last update, so that
	    the <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> step will be able to
	    use the newly installed system user or system group names
	    without problems.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><command>make <maketarget>installworld</maketarget></command></para>

	  <para>Copies the world
	    from <filename class="directory">/usr/obj</filename>.  You now
	    have a new kernel and new world on disk.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><command>mergemaster</command></para>

	  <para>Now you can update the remaining configuration files, since
	    you have a new world on disk.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Reboot.</para>

	  <para>A full machine reboot is needed now to load the new kernel
	    and new world with new configuration files.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that if you're upgrading from one release of the same &os;
	branch to a more recent release of the same branch, i.e. from 7.0 to
	7.1, then this procedure may not be absolutely necessary, since
	you're unlikely to run into serious mismatches between compiler,
	kernel, userland and configuration files.  The older approach
	of <command>make <maketarget>world</maketarget></command> followed
	by building and installing a new kernel might work well enough for
	minor updates.</para>

      <para>But, when upgrading across major releases, people who don't
	follow this procedure should expect some problems.</para>

      <para>It is also worth noting that many upgrades
	(i.e.&nbsp;4.<replaceable>X</replaceable> to 5.0) may require
	specific additional steps (renaming or deleting specific files prior
	to installworld, for instance).  Read
	the <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> file carefully,
	especially at the end, where the currently recommended upgrade
	sequence is explicitly spelled out.</para>

      <para>This procedure has evolved over time as the developers have
	found it impossible to completely prevent certain kinds of mismatch
	problems.  Hopefully, the current procedure will remain stable for a
	long time.</para>

      <para>To summarize, the currently recommended way of upgrading &os;
	from sources is:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildworld</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildkernel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installkernel</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>There are a few rare cases when an extra run of
	  <command>mergemaster -p</command> is needed before the
	  <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> step.  These are
	  described in <filename>UPDATING</filename>.  In general,
	  though, you can safely omit this step if you are not
	  updating across one or more major &os; versions.</para>
      </note>

      <para>After <maketarget>installkernel</maketarget> finishes
	successfully, you should boot in single user mode
	(i.e.&nbsp;using <command>boot -s</command> from the loader
	prompt).  Then run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>adjkerntz -i</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -a -t ufs</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mergemaster -p</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make installworld</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mergemaster</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>reboot</userinput></screen>

      <title>Update the Files in <filename>/etc</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>/etc</filename> directory contains a large part
	of your system's configuration information, as well as scripts
	that are run at system startup.  Some of these scripts change from
	version to version of FreeBSD.</para>

      <para>Some of the configuration files are also used in the day to
	day running of the system.  In particular,
	<filename>/etc/group</filename>.</para>

      <para>There have been occasions when the installation part of
	<command>make installworld</command> has expected certain usernames
	or groups to exist.  When performing an upgrade it is likely that
	these users or groups did not exist.  This caused problems when
	upgrading.  In some cases <command>make buildworld</command> will
	check to see if these users or groups exist.</para>

      <para>An example of this is when the <username>smmsp</username> user
	was added.  Users had the installation process fail for them when
	&man.mtree.8; was trying to create
	<filename>/var/spool/clientmqueue</filename>.</para>

      <para>The solution is to run &man.mergemaster.8; in
	pre-buildworld mode by providing the <option>-p</option> option.
	This will compare only those files that are essential for the success
	of <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> or
	<maketarget>installworld</maketarget>.  If your old version of
	<command>mergemaster</command> does not support <option>-p</option>,
	use the new version in the source tree when running for the first

      <para>You may want to compile the system in single user mode.  Apart
	from the obvious benefit of making things go slightly faster,
	reinstalling the system will touch a lot of important system
	files, all the standard system binaries, libraries, include files

      <indexterm><primary>multi-user mode</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Another method is to compile the system in multi-user mode, and
	then drop into single user mode for the installation.  If you would
	like to do it this way, simply hold off on the following steps until
	the build has completed.  You can postpone dropping to single user
	mode until you have to <maketarget>installkernel</maketarget> or
	<maketarget>installworld</maketarget>.</para>

      <para>As the superuser, you can execute:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>shutdown now</userinput></screen>

      <para>from a running system, which will drop it to single user
	mode.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, reboot the system, and at the boot prompt,
	select the <quote>single user</quote> option.  The system will then
	boot single user.  At the shell prompt you should then run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fsck -p</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -u /</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -a -t ufs</userinput>

      <para>This checks the file systems, remounts <filename>/</filename>

      <note>
	<para>If your CMOS clock is set to local time and not to GMT
	  (this is true if the output of the &man.date.1; command

	<title>Saving the Output</title>

	<para>It is a good idea to save the output you get from running
	  &man.make.1; to another file.  If something goes wrong you will
	  have a copy of the error message.  While this might not help you
	  in diagnosing what has gone wrong, it can help others if you post
	  your problem to one of the &os; mailing lists.</para>

	<para>The easiest way to do this is to use the &man.script.1;
	  command, with a parameter that specifies the name of the file to
	  save all output to.  You would do this immediately before
	  rebuilding the world, and then type <userinput>exit</userinput>
	  when the process has finished.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>script /var/tmp/mw.out</userinput>
Script started, output file is /var/tmp/mw.out
&prompt.root; <userinput>make TARGET</userinput>
<emphasis>&hellip; compile, compile, compile &hellip;</emphasis>
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>
Script done, &hellip;</screen>

	<para>If you do this, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> save the output
	  in <filename>/tmp</filename>.  This directory may be cleared
	  next time you reboot.  A better place to store it is in
	  <filename>/var/tmp</filename> (as in the previous example) or
	  in <username>root</username>'s home directory.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="make-buildworld">
	<title>Compile the Base System</title>

	<para>You must be in the <filename>/usr/src</filename>
	  directory:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput></screen>

	<para>(unless, of course, your source code is elsewhere, in which
	  case change to that directory instead).</para>
	<indexterm><primary><command>make</command></primary></indexterm>

	<para>To rebuild the world you use the &man.make.1; command.  This
	  command reads instructions from the <filename>Makefile</filename>,
	  which describes how the programs that comprise &os; should be
	  rebuilt, the order in which they should be built, and so on.</para>

	<para>The general format of the command line you will type is as
	  follows:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -<replaceable>x</replaceable> -D<replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable> <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>In this example, <option>-<replaceable>x</replaceable></option>
	  is an option that you would pass to &man.make.1;.  See the
	  &man.make.1; manual page for an example of the options you can
	  pass.</para>

	<para><option>-D<replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable></option>
	  passes a variable to the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  The
	  behavior of the <filename>Makefile</filename> is controlled by
	  these variables.  These are the same variables as are set in
	  <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>, and this provides another
	  way of setting them.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DNO_PROFILE <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>is another way of specifying that profiled libraries should
	  not be built, and corresponds with the</para>

	<programlisting>NO_PROFILE=    true     #    Avoid compiling profiled libraries</programlisting>

	<para>line in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.</para>

	<para><replaceable>target</replaceable> tells &man.make.1; what
	  you want to do.  Each <filename>Makefile</filename> defines a
	  number of different <quote>targets</quote>, and your choice of
	  target determines what happens.</para>

	<para>Some targets are listed in the
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>, but are not meant for you to run.
	  Instead, they are used by the build process to break out the
	  steps necessary to rebuild the system into a number of
	  sub-steps.</para>

	<para>Most of the time you will not need to pass any parameters to
	  &man.make.1;, and so your command like will look like
	  this:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>Where <replaceable>target</replaceable> will be one of
	  many build options.  The first target should always be
	  <makevar>buildworld</makevar>.</para>

	<para>As the names imply, <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget>
	  builds a complete new tree under <filename>/usr/obj</filename>,
	  and <maketarget>installworld</maketarget>, another target,
	  installs this tree on the current machine.</para>

	<para>Having separate options is very useful for two reasons.  First,
	  it allows you to do the build safe in the knowledge that no
	  components of your running system will be affected.  The build is
	  <quote>self hosted</quote>.  Because of this, you can safely
	  run <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> on a machine running
	  in multi-user mode with no fear of ill-effects.  It is still
	  recommended that you run the <maketarget>installworld</maketarget>
	  part in single user mode, though.</para>

	<para>Secondly, it allows you to use NFS mounts to upgrade
	  multiple machines on your network.  If you have three machines,
	  <hostid>A</hostid>, <hostid>B</hostid> and <hostid>C</hostid> that
	  you want to upgrade, run <command>make buildworld</command> and
	  <command>make installworld</command> on <hostid>A</hostid>.
	  <hostid>B</hostid> and <hostid>C</hostid> should then NFS mount
	  <filename>/usr/src</filename> and <filename>/usr/obj</filename>
	  from <hostid>A</hostid>, and you can then run
	  <command>make installworld</command> to install the results of
	  the build on <hostid>B</hostid> and <hostid>C</hostid>.</para>

	<para>Although the <maketarget>world</maketarget> target still exists,
	  you are strongly encouraged not to use it.</para>

	<para>Run</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildworld</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is possible to specify a <option>-j</option> option to
	  <command>make</command> which will cause it to spawn several
	  simultaneous processes.  This is most useful on multi-CPU machines.

	<para>The &man.mergemaster.8; utility is a Bourne script that will
	  aid you in determining the differences between your configuration
	  files in <filename>/etc</filename>, and the configuration files in
	  the source tree <filename>/usr/src/etc</filename>.  This is
	  the recommended solution for keeping the system configuration files
	  up to date with those located in the source tree.</para>

	<para>To begin simply type <command>mergemaster</command> at your
	  prompt, and watch it start going.  <command>mergemaster</command>
	  will then build a temporary root environment, from
	  <filename>/</filename> down, and populate it with various system
	  configuration files.  Those files are then compared to the ones
	  currently installed in your system.  At this point, files that
	  differ will be shown in &man.diff.1; format, with the
	  <option>+</option> sign representing added or modified lines, and
	  <option>-</option> representing lines that will be either removed
	  completely, or replaced with a new line.  See the &man.diff.1;
	  manual page for more information about the &man.diff.1; syntax and
	  how file differences are shown.</para>

	<para>&man.mergemaster.8; will then show you each file that displays
	  variances, and at this point you will have the option of either
	  deleting the new file (referred to as the temporary file),
	  installing the temporary file in its unmodified state, merging the
	  temporary file with the currently installed file, or viewing the
	  &man.diff.1; results again.</para>

	<para>Choosing to delete the temporary file will tell
	  &man.mergemaster.8; that we wish to keep our current file
	  unchanged, and to delete the new version.  This option is not
	  recommended, unless you see no reason to change the current file.
	  You can get help at any time by typing <keycap>?</keycap> at the
	  &man.mergemaster.8; prompt.  If the user chooses to skip a file,
	  it will be presented again after all other files have been dealt
	  with.</para>

	<para>Choosing to install the unmodified temporary file will replace
	  the current file with the new one.  For most unmodified files,
	  this is the best option.</para>

	<para>Choosing to merge the file will present you with a text editor,
	  and the contents of both files.  You can now merge them by
	  reviewing both files side by side on the screen, and choosing parts
	  from both to create a finished product.  When the files are
	  compared side by side, the <keycap>l</keycap> key will select the
	  left contents and the <keycap>r</keycap> key will select contents
	  from your right.  The final output will be a file consisting of
	  both parts, which can then be installed.  This option is
	  customarily used for files where settings have been modified by
	  the user.</para>

	<para>Choosing to view the &man.diff.1; results again will show you
	  the file differences just like &man.mergemaster.8; did before
	  prompting you for an option.</para>

	<para>After &man.mergemaster.8; is done with the system files you
	  will be prompted for other options.  &man.mergemaster.8; may ask
	  if you want to rebuild the password file and will finish up with
	  an option to remove left-over temporary files.</para>

	<para>If you wish to do the update manually, however,

	  have it work.  Some of these files must be <quote>installed</quote>
	  first.  This is because the <filename>/usr/src/etc</filename>
	  directory <emphasis>is not</emphasis> a copy of what your

	<para>If you are using &man.mergemaster.8; (as recommended),
	  you can skip forward to the <link

	  files into a new directory, and then work through them looking
	  for differences.</para>

	  <title>Backup Your Existing <filename>/etc</filename></title>

	  <para>Although, in theory, nothing is going to touch this directory
	    automatically, it is always better to be sure.  So copy your
	    existing <filename>/etc</filename> directory somewhere safe.
	    Something like:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp -Rp /etc /etc.old</userinput></screen>

	  <para><option>-R</option> does a recursive copy, <option>-p</option>
	    preserves times, ownerships on files and suchlike.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>You need to build a dummy set of directories to install the new
	  <filename>/etc</filename> and other files into.
	  <filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> is a reasonable choice, and
	  there are a number of subdirectories required under this as
	  well.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/root</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/etc</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/root distrib-dirs distribution</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will build the necessary directory structure and install
	  the files.  A lot of the subdirectories that have been created under
	  <filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> are empty and should be deleted.
	  The simplest way to do this is to:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /var/tmp/root</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>find -d . -type d | xargs rmdir 2&gt;/dev/null</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will remove all empty directories.  (Standard error is
	  redirected to <filename>/dev/null</filename> to prevent the warnings
	  about the directories that are not empty.)</para>

	<para><filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> now contains all the files
	  that should be placed in appropriate locations below
	  <filename>/</filename>.  You now have to go through each of these
	  files, determining how they differ with your existing files.</para>

	<para>Note that some of the files that will have been installed in
	  <filename>/var/tmp/root</filename> have a leading <quote>.</quote>.
	  At the time of writing the only files like this are shell startup
	  files in <filename>/var/tmp/root/</filename> and
	  <filename>/var/tmp/root/root/</filename>, although there may be
	  others (depending on when you are reading this).  Make sure you use
	  <command>ls -a</command> to catch them.</para>

	<para>The simplest way to do this is to use &man.diff.1; to compare
	  the two files:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>diff /etc/shells /var/tmp/root/etc/shells</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will show you the differences between your
	  <filename>/etc/shells</filename> file and the new
	  <filename>/var/tmp/root/etc/shells</filename> file.  Use these to
	  decide whether to merge in changes that you have made or whether to
	  copy over your old file.</para>

	  <para>Frequently rebuilding the world means that you have to update
	    <filename>/etc</filename> frequently as well, which can be a bit

	  <para>You can speed this process up by keeping a copy of the last
	    set of changed files that you merged into
	    <filename>/etc</filename>.  The following procedure gives one
	    idea of how to do this.</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Make the world as normal.  When you want to update
		<filename>/etc</filename> and the other directories, give the
		target directory a name based on the current date.  If you
		were doing this on the 14th of February 1998 you could do the
		following:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/root-19980214</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/etc</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/root-19980214 \
    distrib-dirs distribution</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Merge in the changes from this directory as outlined
		above.</para>

	      <para><emphasis>Do not</emphasis> remove the
		<filename>/var/tmp/root-19980214</filename> directory when you
		have finished.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>When you have downloaded the latest version of the source
		and remade it, follow step 1.  This will give you a new
		directory, which might be called
		<filename>/var/tmp/root-19980221</filename> (if you wait a
		week between doing updates).</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>You can now see the differences that have been made in the
		intervening week using &man.diff.1; to create a recursive
		diff between the two directories:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /var/tmp</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>diff -r root-19980214 root-19980221</userinput></screen>

	      <para>Typically, this will be a much smaller set of differences
		than those between
		<filename>/var/tmp/root-19980221/etc</filename> and
		<filename>/etc</filename>.  Because the set of differences is
		smaller, it is easier to migrate those changes across into
		your <filename>/etc</filename> directory.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>You can now remove the older of the two
		<filename>/var/tmp/root-*</filename> directories:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>rm -rf /var/tmp/root-19980214</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Repeat this process every time you need to merge in
		changes to <filename>/etc</filename>.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>You can use &man.date.1; to automate the generation of the
	    directory names:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/root-`date "+%Y%m%d"`</userinput></screen>

	  <question>
	    <para>Do I need to re-make the world for every change?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>There is no easy answer to this one, as it depends on the
	      nature of the change.  For example, if you just ran
	      <application>CVSup</application>, and it has shown the
	      following files as being updated:</para>

	    <screen><filename>src/games/cribbage/instr.c</filename>
<filename>src/games/sail/pl_main.c</filename>
<filename>src/release/sysinstall/config.c</filename>
<filename>src/release/sysinstall/media.c</filename>
<filename>src/share/mk/bsd.port.mk</filename></screen>

	    <para>it probably is not worth rebuilding the entire world.
	      You could just go to the appropriate sub-directories and
	      <command>make all install</command>, and that's about it.  But
	      if something major changed, for example
	      <filename>src/lib/libc/stdlib</filename> then you should either
	      re-make the world, or at least those parts of it that are
	      statically linked (as well as anything else you might have added
	      that is statically linked).</para>

	    <para>At the end of the day, it is your call.  You might be happy
	      re-making the world every fortnight say, and let changes
	      accumulate over that fortnight.  Or you might want to re-make
	      just those things that have changed, and be confident you can
	      spot all the dependencies.</para>

	    <para>And, of course, this all depends on how often you want to

	  </question>
	  <indexterm><primary>signal 11</primary></indexterm>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This is normally indicative of hardware problems.
	      (Re)making the world is an effective way to stress test your
	      hardware, and will frequently throw up memory problems.  These
	      normally manifest themselves as the compiler mysteriously dying
	      on receipt of strange signals.</para>

	    <para>A sure indicator of this is if you can restart the make and
	      it dies at a different point in the process.</para>

	    <para>In this instance there is little you can do except start

	  <question>
	    <para>Can I remove <filename>/usr/obj</filename> when I have
	      finished?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The short answer is yes.</para>

	    <para><filename>/usr/obj</filename> contains all the object files
	      that were produced during the compilation phase.  Normally, one
	      of the first steps in the <command>make buildworld</command>
	      process is to remove this directory and start afresh.  In this
	      case, keeping <filename>/usr/obj</filename> around after you
	      have finished makes little sense, and will free up a large
	      chunk of disk space (currently about 2&nbsp;GB).</para>

	    <para>However, if you know what you are doing you can have
	      <command>make buildworld</command> skip this step.  This will
	      make subsequent builds run much faster, since most of sources
	      will not need to be recompiled.  The flip side of this is that
	      subtle dependency problems can creep in, causing your build to
	      fail in odd ways.  This frequently generates noise on the &os;
	      mailing lists, when one person complains that their build has
	      failed, not realizing that it is because they have tried to cut
	      corners.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can interrupted builds be resumed?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This depends on how far through the process you got before
	      you found a problem.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>In general</emphasis> (and this is not a hard and
	      fast rule) the <command>make buildworld</command> process
	      builds new copies of essential tools (such as &man.gcc.1;, and
	      &man.make.1;) and the system libraries.  These tools and
	      libraries are then installed.  The new tools and libraries are
	      then used to rebuild themselves, and are installed again.  The
	      entire system (now including regular user programs, such as
	      &man.ls.1; or &man.grep.1;) is then rebuilt with the new
	      system files.</para>

	    <para>If you are at the last stage, and you know it (because you
	      have looked through the output that you were storing) then you
	      can (fairly safely) do:</para>

&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DNO_CLEAN all</userinput></screen>

    <title>Deleting obsolete files, directories and libraries</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Deleting obsolete files, directories and libraries</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>As a part of the &os; development lifecycle, it happens from time
      to time that files and their contents become obsolete.  This may be
      because their functionality is implemented elsewhere, the version number
      of the library has changed or it was removed from the system entirely.
      This includes old files, libraries and directories, which should
      be removed when updating the system.  The benefit for the user is that
      the system is not cluttered with old files which take up unnecessary
      space on the storage (and backup) medium.  Additionally, if the old
      library had a security or stability issue, you should update to the
      newer library to keep your system safe and prevent crashes caused by
      the old library implementation.  The files, directories, and libraries
      that are considered obsolete are listed in
      <filename>/usr/src/ObsoleteFiles.inc</filename>.  The following
      instructions will help you removing these obsolete files during the
      system upgrade process.</para>

    <para>We assume you are following the steps outlined in <xref
      linkend="canonical-build">.  After the <command>make
      <maketarget>installworld</maketarget></command> and the subsequent
      <command>mergemaster</command> commands have finished successfully, you
      should check for obsolete files and libraries as follows:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make check-old</userinput></screen>

    <para>If any obsolete files are found, they can be deleted using the
      following commands:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make delete-old</userinput></screen>

    <tip>
      <para>See <filename>/usr/src/Makefile</filename>
        for more targets of interest.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>A prompt is displayed before deleting each obsolete file.  You can
      skip the prompt and let the system remove these files automatically by
      using the <makevar>BATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES</makevar> make-variable as
      follows:<para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -DBATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES delete-old</userinput></screen>

    <para>You can also achieve the same goal by piping these commands through
      <command>yes</command> like this:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>yes|make delete-old</userinput></screen>

    <warning>
      <title>Warning</title>
        <para>Deleting obsolete files will break applications that still
          depend on those obsolete files.  This is especially true for old
          libraries. In most cases, you need to recompile the programs, ports,
          or libraries that used the old library before <command>make
      <maketarget>delete-old-libs</maketarget></command> is executed.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>Utilities for checking shared library dependencies are available from
      the Ports Collection in <filename
      role="package">sysutils/libchk</filename> or <filename
      role="package">sysutils/bsdadminscripts</filename>.</para>

    <para>Obsolete shared libraries can conflict with newer libraries,
      causing messages like these:</para>

    <screen>/usr/bin/ld: warning: libz.so.4, needed by /usr/local/lib/libtiff.so, may conflict with libz.so.5
/usr/bin/ld: warning: librpcsvc.so.4, needed by /usr/local/lib/libXext.so, may conflict with librpcsvc.so.5</screen>

    <para>To solve these problems, determine which port installed the
      library:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_info -W  /usr/local/lib/libtiff.so</userinput>
/usr/local/lib/libtiff.so was installed by package tiff-3.9.4
&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_info -W /usr/local/lib/libXext.so</userinput>
/usr/local/lib/libXext.so was installed by package libXext-1.1.1,1</screen>

    <para>Then deinstall, rebuild and reinstall the port. The <filename
      role="package">ports-mgmt/portmaster</filename> and <filename
      role="package">ports-mgmt/portupgrade</filename> utilities can be used to
      automate this process.  After you've made sure that all ports are rebuilt
      and do not use the old libraries anymore, you can delete them using the
      following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make delete-old-libs</userinput></screen>

    <title>Tracking for Multiple Machines</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>NFS</primary>
      <secondary>installing multiple machines</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>If you have multiple machines that you want to track the
      same source tree, then having all of them download sources and
      rebuild everything seems like a waste of resources: disk space,
      network bandwidth, and CPU cycles.  It is, and the solution is
      to have one machine do most of the work, while the rest of the
      machines mount that work via NFS.  This section outlines a
      method of doing so.</para>

    <sect2 id="small-lan-preliminaries">
      <title>Preliminaries</title>

      <para>First, identify a set of machines that is going to run
	the same set of binaries, which we will call a
	<emphasis>build set</emphasis>.  Each machine can have a
	custom kernel, but they will be running the same userland
	binaries.  From that set, choose a machine to be the
	<emphasis>build machine</emphasis>.  It is going to be the
	machine that the world and kernel are built on.  Ideally, it
	should be a fast machine that has sufficient spare CPU to
	run <command>make buildworld</command> and
	<command>make buildkernel</command>.  You will also want to
	choose a machine to be the <emphasis>test
	machine</emphasis>, which will test software updates before they
	are put into production.  This <emphasis>must</emphasis> be a
	machine that you can afford to have down for an extended
	period of time.  It can be the build machine, but need not be.</para>

      <para>All the machines in this build set need to mount
	<filename>/usr/obj</filename> and
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> from the same machine, and at
	the same point.  Ideally, those are on two different drives
	on the build machine, but they can be NFS mounted on that machine
	as well.  If you have multiple build sets,
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> should be on one build machine, and
	NFS mounted on the rest.</para>

      <para>Finally make sure that
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> and
	<filename>/etc/src.conf</filename> on all the machines in
	the build set agrees with the build machine.  That means that
	the build machine must build all the parts of the base
	system that any machine in the build set is going to
	install.  Also, each build machine should have its kernel
	name set with <makevar>KERNCONF</makevar> in
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>, and the build machine
	should list them all in <makevar>KERNCONF</makevar>, listing
	its own kernel first.  The build machine must have the kernel
	configuration files for each machine in
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename>
	if it is going to build their kernels.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="small-lan-base-system">
      <title>The Base System</title>

      <para>Now that all that is done, you are ready to build
	everything.  Build the kernel and world as described in <xref
	  linkend="make-buildworld"> on the build machine,
	but do not install anything.  After the build has finished, go
	to the test machine, and install the kernel you just
	built.  If this machine mounts <filename>/usr/src</filename>
	and <filename>/usr/obj</filename> via NFS, when you reboot
	to single user you will need to enable the network and mount
	them.  The easiest way to do this is to boot to multi-user,
	then run <command>shutdown now</command> to go to single user
	mode.  Once there, you can install the new kernel and world and run
	<command>mergemaster</command> just as you normally would.  When
	done, reboot to return to normal multi-user operations for this
	machine.</para>

      <para>After you are certain that everything on the test
	machine is working properly, use the same procedure to
	install the new software on each of the other machines in
	the build set.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="small-lan-ports">
      <title>Ports</title>

      <para>The same ideas can be used for the ports tree.  The first
	critical step is mounting <filename>/usr/ports</filename> from
	the same machine to all the machines in the build set.  You can
	then set up <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> properly to share
	distfiles.  You should set <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> to a
	common shared directory that is writable by whichever user
	<username>root</username> is mapped to by your NFS mounts.  Each
	machine should set <makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar> to a
	local build directory.  Finally, if you are going to be
	building and distributing packages, you should set
	<makevar>PACKAGES</makevar> to a directory similar to
	<makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>.</para>

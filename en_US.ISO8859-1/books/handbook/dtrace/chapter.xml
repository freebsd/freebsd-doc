Recently I suggested to myself that this should become a profiling
and debugging chapter, which covers things like ktrace(1) and
using other debugging (like -x in shell scripts).  But then I
realized that, over time and while DTrace becomes better supported,
that might make this chapter too large.

    <para>&dtrace;, also known as Dynamic Tracing, was developed by
      &sun; as a tool for locating performance bottlenecks in
      production and pre-production systems.  It is not, in any way,
      a debugging tool, but a tool for real time system analysis to
      locate performance and other issues.</para>

    <para>&dtrace; is a remarkable profiling tool, with an impressive
      array of features for diagnosing system issues.  It may also
      be used to run pre-written scripts to take advantage of its
      capabilities.  Users may even author their own utilities using
      the &dtrace; D Language, allowing them to customize their
      profiling based on specific needs.</para>

  <sect1 id="dtrace-implementation">
    <title>Implementation Differences</title>

    <para>While the &dtrace; in &os; is very similar to that found
      in &solaris;, differences exist that should be explained before
      continuing.  The primary difference users will notice is that
      on &os;, &dtrace; needs to be specifically enabled.  There are
      kernel options and modules which must be enabled for &dtrace; to
      work properly.  These will be explained later.</para>

    <para>There is a <literal>DDB_CTF</literal> kernel option which
      is used to enable support for loading the <acronym>CTF</acronym>
      data from kernel modules and the kernel itself.
      <acronym>CTF</acronym> is the &solaris; Compact C Type Format
      which encapsulates a reduced form of debugging information
      similar to <acronym>DWARF</acronym> and the venerable stabs.
      This <acronym>CTF</acronym> data is added to the binaries by the
      <command>ctfconvert</command> and <command>ctfmerge</command>
      build tools.  The <command>ctfconvert</command> utility parses
      <acronym>DWARF</acronym> <acronym>ELF</acronym> debug sections
      created by the compiler and <command>ctfmerge</command> merges
      <acronym>CTF</acronym> <acronym>ELF</acronym> sections from
      objects into either executables or shared libraries.  More on
      how to enable this for the kernel and &os; build is
      forthcoming.</para>

    <para>Some different providers exist for &os; than for &solaris;.
      Most notable is the <literal>dtmalloc</literal> provider, which
      allows tracing <function>malloc()</function> by type in the
      &os; kernel.</para>

    <para>Only <username>root</username> may use &dtrace; on &os;.
      This is related to security differences, &solaris; has a few
      low level security checks which do not yet exist in &os;.  As
      such, the <devicename>/dev/dtrace/dtrace</devicename> is
      strictly limited to <username>root</username> users only.</para>

    <para>Finally, the &dtrace; software falls under &sun;'s
      <acronym>CDDL</acronym> license.  The <literal>Common
      Development and Distribution License</literal> comes with &os;,
      see the
      <filename>/usr/src/cddl/contrib/opensolaris/OPENSOLARIS.LICENSE</filename>
      or view it online at
      <ulink
      url="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/licensing"></ulink>.</para>

    <para>This license means that a &os; kernel with the &dtrace;
      options is still <acronym>BSD</acronym> licensed; however
      the <acronym>CDDL</acronym> kicks in when the modules are
      distributed in binary form, or the binaries are loaded.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="dtrace-enable">
    <title>Enabling &dtrace; Support</title>

    <para>To enable support for &dtrace;, add the following lines to
      the kernel configuration file:</para>

    <programlisting>options         KDTRACE_HOOKS
options         DDB_CTF</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>Users of the AMD64 architecture will want to add the
	following line to their kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>options         KDTRACE_FRAME</programlisting>

      <para>This option provides support for the
	<acronym>FBT</acronym> feature.  &dtrace; will work without
	this option; however, there will be limited support for
	function boundary tracing.</para>
    </note>

    <para>All sources must be rebuilt and installed with
      <acronym>CTF</acronym> options.
      To accomplish this task, rebuild the &os; sources using:</para>

    <!-- XXXTR: WITH_CTF has been reported to leave a user with a
         broken system when used with buildworld.  Until this is
         fixed, comment out those parts.  When uncommenting, kill
         the extra screen.
    -->

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput>
<!-- &prompt.root; <userinput>make WITH_CTF=1 buildworld</userinput> -->
&prompt.root; <userinput>make WITH_CTF=1 kernel</userinput></screen>

<!-- &prompt.root; <userinput>make WITH_CTF=1 installworld</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mergemaster -Ui</userinput></screen> -->

    <para>The system will need to be restarted.</para>

    <para>After rebooting and allowing the new kernel to be loaded
      into memory, support for the Korn shell should be added.  This
      is needed as the &dtrace;Toolkit has several utilities written
      in <command>ksh</command>.  Install the
      <filename role="package">shells/ksh93</filename>.  It is also
      possible to run these tools under
      <filename role="package">shells/pdksh</filename> or
      <filename role="package">shells/mksh</filename>.</para>

    <para>Finally, obtain the current &dtrace;Toolkit.
      If you are running FreeBSD 10, you will find the &dtrace;Toolkit
      in <filename>/usr/share/dtrace</filename>.
      Otherwise, you can install the &dtrace;Toolkit using the
      <filename role="package">sysutils/DTraceToolkit</filename>
      port.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="dtrace-using">
    <title>Using &dtrace;</title>

    <para>Before making use of &dtrace; functionality, the &dtrace;
      device must exist.  To load the device, issue the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload dtraceall</userinput></screen>

    <para>&dtrace; support should now be available.  To view all
      probes the administrator may now execute the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dtrace -l | more</userinput></screen>

    <para>All output is passed to the <command>more</command>
      utility as it will quickly overflow the screen buffer.  At
      this point, &dtrace; should be considered working.  It is now
      time to review the toolkit.</para>

    <para>The toolkit is a collection of ready-made scripts to run
      with &dtrace; to collect system information.  There are scripts
      to check open files, memory, <acronym>CPU</acronym> usage and
      a lot more.  Extract the scripts with the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gunzip -c DTraceToolkit* | tar xvf -</userinput></screen>

    <para>Change into that directory with the <command>cd</command>
      and change the execution permissions on all files, designated
      as those files with lower case names, to
      <literal>755</literal>.</para>

    <para>All of these scripts will need modifications to their
      contents.  The ones which refer to
      <filename>/usr/bin/ksh</filename> need that changed to
      <filename>/usr/local/bin/ksh</filename>, the others which
      use <filename>/usr/bin/sh</filename> need to be altered to use
      <filename>/bin/sh</filename>, and finally the ones which
      use <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename> will need altered to
      use <filename>/usr/local/bin/perl</filename>.</para>

    <important>
      <para>At this point it is prudent to remind the reader that
	&dtrace; support in &os; is <emphasis>incomplete</emphasis>
	and <emphasis>experimental</emphasis>.  Many of these scripts
	will not work as they are either too &solaris;-specific or
	use probes which are unsupported at this time.</para>
    </important>

    <para>At the time of this writing only two of the scripts of the
      &dtrace; Toolkit are fully supported in &os;:
      the <filename>hotkernel</filename>
      and <filename>procsystime</filename> scripts.  These are the two
      we will explore in the following parts of this section.</para>

    <para>The <filename>hotkernel</filename> is designed to identify
      which function is using the most kernel time.  Run normally, it
      will produce output similar to the following:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/share/dtrace/toolkit</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./hotkernel</userinput>
Sampling... Hit Ctrl-C to end.</screen>

    <para>The system administrator must use the
      <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap>
      </keycombo> key combination to stop the process.  Upon
      termination, the script will display a list of kernel functions
      and timing information, sorting the output in increasing order
      of time:</para>

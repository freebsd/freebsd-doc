Recently I suggested to myself that this should become a profiling
and debugging chapter, which covers things like ktrace(1) and
using other debugging (like -x in shell scripts).  But then I
realized that, over time and while DTrace becomes better supported,
that might make this chapter too large.

    <para>&dtrace;, also known as Dynamic Tracing, was developed by
      &sun; as a tool for locating performance bottlenecks in
      production and pre-production systems.  In addition to
      diagnosing performance problems, &dtrace; can be used to help
      investigate and debug unexpected behavior in both the &os;
      kernel and in userland programs.</para>

    <para>&dtrace; is a remarkable profiling tool, with an impressive
      array of features for diagnosing system issues.  It may also be
      used to run pre-written scripts to take advantage of its
      capabilities.  Users can author their own utilities using the
      &dtrace; D Language, allowing them to customize their profiling
      based on specific needs.</para>

    <para>The &os; implementation provides full support for kernel
      &dtrace; and experimental support for userland &dtrace;.
      Userland &dtrace; allows users to perform function boundary
      tracing for userland programs using the <literal>pid</literal>
      provider, and to insert static probes into userland programs for
      later tracing.  Some ports, such as
      <package>databases/postgres-server</package> and
      <package>lang/php56</package> have a &dtrace; option to enable
      static probes.  &os; 10.0-RELEASE has reasonably good userland
      &dtrace; support, but it is not considered production ready.  In
      particular, it is possible to crash traced programs.</para>

    <title>Implementation Differences</title>

    <para>While the &dtrace; in &os; is similar to that found in
      &solaris;, differences do exist.  The primary difference is that
      in &os;, &dtrace; is implemented as a set of kernel modules and
      &dtrace; can not be used until the modules are loaded.  To load
      all of the necessary modules:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload dtraceall</userinput></screen>

    <para>Beginning with &os; 10.0-RELEASE, the modules are
      automatically loaded when <command>dtrace</command> is
      run.</para>

    <para>&os; uses the <literal>DDB_CTF</literal> kernel option to
      enable support for loading <acronym>CTF</acronym> data from
      kernel modules and the kernel itself.  <acronym>CTF</acronym> is
      the &solaris; Compact C Type Format which encapsulates a reduced
      form of debugging information similar to
      <acronym>DWARF</acronym> and the venerable stabs.
      <acronym>CTF</acronym> data is added to binaries by the
      <command>ctfconvert</command> and <command>ctfmerge</command>
      build tools.  The <command>ctfconvert</command> utility parses
      <acronym>DWARF</acronym> <acronym>ELF</acronym> debug sections
      created by the compiler and <command>ctfmerge</command> merges
      <acronym>CTF</acronym> <acronym>ELF</acronym> sections from
      objects into either executables or shared libraries.</para>

    <para>Some different providers exist for &os; than for &solaris;.
      Most notable is the <literal>dtmalloc</literal> provider, which
      allows tracing <function>malloc()</function> by type in the &os;
      kernel.  Some of the providers found in &solaris;, such as
      <literal>cpc</literal> and <literal>mib</literal>, are not
      present in &os;.  These may appear in future versions of &os;.
      Moreover, some of the providers available in both operating
      systems are not compatible, in the sense that their probes have
      different argument types.  Thus, <acronym>D</acronym> scripts
      written on &solaris; may or may not work unmodified on &os;, and
      vice versa.</para>

    <para>Due to security differences, only <systemitem
	class="username">root</systemitem> may use &dtrace; on &os;.
      &solaris; has a few low level security checks which do not yet
      exist in &os;.  As such, the
      <filename>/dev/dtrace/dtrace</filename> is strictly limited to
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.</para>

    <para>&dtrace; falls under the Common Development and Distribution
      License (<acronym>CDDL</acronym>) license.  To view this license
      on &os;, see
      <filename>/usr/src/cddl/contrib/opensolaris/OPENSOLARIS.LICENSE</filename>
      or view it online at <uri
	xlink:href="http://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0</uri>.
      While a &os; kernel with &dtrace; support is
      <acronym>BSD</acronym> licensed, the <acronym>CDDL</acronym> is
      used when the modules are distributed in binary form or the
      binaries are loaded.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="dtrace-enable">
    <title>Enabling &dtrace; Support</title>

    <para>In &os; 9.2 and 10.0, &dtrace; support is built into the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  Users of earlier versions
      of &os; or who prefer to statically compile in &dtrace; support
      should add the following lines to a custom kernel configuration
      file and recompile the kernel using the instructions in <xref
	linkend="kernelconfig"/>:</para>

    <programlisting>options         KDTRACE_HOOKS
options         DDB_CTF
makeoptions	DEBUG=-g
makeoptions	WITH_CTF=1</programlisting>

    <para>Users of the AMD64 architecture should also add this
      line:</para>

    <programlisting>options         KDTRACE_FRAME</programlisting>

    <para>This option provides support for <acronym>FBT</acronym>.
      While &dtrace; will work without this option, there will be
      limited support for function boundary tracing.</para>

    <para>Once the &os; system has rebooted into the new kernel, or
      the &dtrace; kernel modules have been loaded using
      <command>kldload dtraceall</command>, the system will need
      support for the Korn shell as the &dtrace;
      Toolkit has several utilities written in <command>ksh</command>.
      Make sure that the <package>shells/ksh93</package> package or
      port is installed.  It is also possible to run these tools under
      <package>shells/pdksh</package> or
      <package>shells/mksh</package>.</para>

    <para>Finally, install the current &dtrace; Toolkit,
      a collection of ready-made scripts
      for collecting system information.  There are scripts to check
      open files, memory, <acronym>CPU</acronym> usage, and a lot
      more.  &os; 10
      installs a few of these scripts into
      <filename>/usr/share/dtrace</filename>.  On other &os; versions,
      or to install the full
      &dtrace; Toolkit, use the
      <package>sysutils/DTraceToolkit</package> package or
      port.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The scripts found in
	<filename>/usr/share/dtrace</filename> have been specifically
	ported to &os;.  Not all of the scripts found in the &dtrace;
	Toolkit will work as-is on &os; and some scripts may require
	some effort in order for them to work on &os;.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The &dtrace; Toolkit includes many scripts in the special
      language of &dtrace;.  This language is called the D language
      and it is very similar to C++.  An in depth discussion of the
      language is beyond the scope of this document.  It is
      extensively discussed at <uri
	xlink:href="http://wikis.oracle.com/display/DTrace/Documentation">http://wikis.oracle.com/display/DTrace/Documentation</uri>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="dtrace-using">
    <title>Using &dtrace;</title>

    <para>&dtrace; scripts consist of a list of one or more
      <firstterm>probes</firstterm>, or instrumentation points, where
      each probe is associated with an action.  Whenever the condition
      for a probe is met, the associated action is executed.  For
      example, an action may occur when a file is opened, a process is
      started, or a line of code is executed.  The action might be to
      log some information or to modify context variables.  The
      reading and writing of context variables allows probes to share
      information and to cooperatively analyze the correlation of
      different events.</para>

    <para>To view all probes, the administrator can execute the
      following command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dtrace -l | more</userinput></screen>

    <para>Each probe has an <literal>ID</literal>, a
      <literal>PROVIDER</literal> (dtrace or fbt), a
      <literal>MODULE</literal>, and a
      <literal>FUNCTION NAME</literal>.    Refer to &man.dtrace.1; for
      more information about this command.</para>

    <para>The examples in this section provide an overview of how to
      use two of the fully supported scripts from the
      &dtrace; Toolkit: the
      <filename>hotkernel</filename> and
      <filename>procsystime</filename> scripts.</para>

    <para>The <filename>hotkernel</filename> script is designed to
      identify which function is using the most kernel time.  It will
      produce output similar to the following:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/share/dtrace/toolkit</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>./hotkernel</userinput>
Sampling... Hit Ctrl-C to end.</screen>

    <para>As instructed, use the
      <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap>
      </keycombo> key combination to stop the process.  Upon
      termination, the script will display a list of kernel functions
      and timing information, sorting the output in increasing order
      of time:</para>

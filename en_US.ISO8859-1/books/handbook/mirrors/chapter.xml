    <para>The official sources for &os; are available via anonymous

      <uri xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/</uri> is well
      connected and allows a large number of connections to it, but

    <para>Additionally, &os; is available via anonymous FTP from the

      sites listed as <quote>Primary Mirror Sites</quote> typically
      have the entire &os; archive (all the currently available
      versions for each of the architectures) but you will probably
      have faster download times from a site that is in your country
      or region.  The regional sites carry the most recent versions
      for the most popular architecture(s) but might not carry the
      entire &os; archive.  All sites provide access via anonymous FTP

    <title>Using CTM</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>CTM</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para><application>CTM</application> is a method for keeping a
      remote directory tree in sync with a central one.  It has been
      developed for usage with &os;'s source trees, though other
      people may find it useful for other purposes as time goes by.
      Little, if any, documentation currently exists at this time on
      the process of creating deltas, so contact the
      &a.ctm-users.name; mailing list for more information and if you
      wish to use <application>CTM</application> for other
      things.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Why Should I Use <application>CTM</application>?</title>

      <para><application>CTM</application> will give you a local copy
	of the &os; source trees.  There are a number of
	<quote>flavors</quote> of the tree available.  Whether you
	wish to track the entire CVS tree or just one of the branches,
	<application>CTM</application> can provide you the
	information.  If you are an active developer on &os;, but have
	lousy or non-existent TCP/IP connectivity, or simply wish to
	have the changes automatically sent to you,
	<application>CTM</application> was made for you.  You will
	need to obtain up to three deltas per day for the most active
	branches.  However, you should consider having them sent by
	automatic email.  The sizes of the updates are always kept as
	small as possible.  This is typically less than 5K, with an
	occasional (one in ten) being 10-50K and every now and then a
	large 100K+ or more coming around.</para>

      <para>You will also need to make yourself aware of the various
	caveats related to working directly from the development
	sources rather than a pre-packaged release.  This is
	particularly true if you choose the <quote>current</quote>
	sources.  It is recommended that you read <link linkend="current">Staying current with &os;</link>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>What Do I Need to Use
	<application>CTM</application>?</title>

      <para>You will need two things: The
	<application>CTM</application> program, and the initial deltas
	to feed it (to get up to <quote>current</quote>
	levels).</para>

      <para>The <application>CTM</application> program has been part
	of &os; ever since version 2.0 was released, and lives in
	<filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/ctm</filename> if you have a copy
	of the source available.</para>

      <para>The <quote>deltas</quote> you feed
	<application>CTM</application> can be had two ways, FTP or
	email.  If you have general FTP access to the Internet then
	the following FTP sites support access to
	<application>CTM</application>:</para>

      <para><uri xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CTM/">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CTM/</uri></para>

      <para>or see section <link linkend="mirrors-ctm">mirrors</link>.</para>

      <para>FTP the relevant directory and fetch the
	<filename>README</filename> file, starting from there.</para>

      <para>If you wish to get your deltas via email:</para>

      <para>Subscribe to one of the
	<application>CTM</application> distribution lists.
	&a.ctm-src-cur.name; supports the entire Subversion tree.
	&a.ctm-src-cur.name; supports the head of the development
	branch.  &a.ctm-src-9.name; supports the 9.X release branch,
	etc..  (If you do not know how to subscribe yourself to a
	list, click on the list name above or go to
	&a.mailman.lists.link; and click on the list that you wish to
	subscribe to.  The list page should contain all of the
	necessary subscription instructions.)</para>

      <para>When you begin receiving your
	<application>CTM</application> updates in the mail, you may
	use the <command>ctm_rmail</command> program to unpack and
	apply them.  You can actually use the
	<command>ctm_rmail</command> program directly from a entry in
	<filename>/etc/aliases</filename> if you want to have the
	process run in a fully automated fashion.  Check the
	<command>ctm_rmail</command> manual page for more
	details.</para>

      <note>
	<para>No matter what method you use to get the
	  <application>CTM</application> deltas, you should subscribe
	  to the &a.ctm-announce.name; mailing list.  In the future,
	  this will be the only place where announcements concerning
	  the operations of the <application>CTM</application> system
	  will be posted.  Click on the list name above and follow the
	  instructions to subscribe to the list.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using <application>CTM</application> for the First
	Time</title>

      <para>Before you can start using <application>CTM</application>
	deltas, you will need to get to a starting point for the
	deltas produced subsequently to it.</para>

      <para>First you should determine what you already have.
	Everyone can start from an <quote>empty</quote> directory.
	You must use an initial <quote>Empty</quote> delta to start
	off your <application>CTM</application> supported tree.  At
	some point it is intended that one of these
	<quote>started</quote> deltas be distributed on the CD for
	your convenience, however, this does not currently
	happen.</para>

      <para>Since the trees are many tens of megabytes, you should
	prefer to start from something already at hand.  If you have a
	-RELEASE CD, you can copy or extract an initial source from
	it.  This will save a significant transfer of data.</para>

      <para>You can recognize these <quote>starter</quote> deltas by
	the <literal>X</literal> appended to the number
	(<filename>src-cur.3210XEmpty.gz</filename> for instance).
	The designation following the <literal>X</literal> corresponds
	to the origin of your initial <quote>seed</quote>.
	<filename>Empty</filename> is an empty directory.  As a rule a
	base transition from <literal>Empty</literal> is produced
	every 100 deltas.  By the way, they are large! 70 to 80
	Megabytes of <command>gzip</command>'d data is common for the
	<filename>XEmpty</filename> deltas.</para>

      <para>Once you have picked a base delta to start from, you will
	also need all deltas with higher numbers following it.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using <application>CTM</application> in Your Daily
	Life</title>

      <para>To apply the deltas, simply say:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /where/ever/you/want/the/stuff</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ctm -v -v /where/you/store/your/deltas/src-xxx.*</userinput></screen>

      <para><application>CTM</application> understands deltas which
	have been put through <command>gzip</command>, so you do not
	need to <command>gunzip</command> them first, this saves disk
	space.</para>

      <para>Unless it feels very secure about the entire process,
	<application>CTM</application> will not touch your tree.  To
	verify a delta you can also use the <option>-c</option> flag
	and <application>CTM</application> will not actually touch
	your tree; it will merely verify the integrity of the delta
	and see if it would apply cleanly to your current tree.</para>

      <para>There are other options to <application>CTM</application>
	as well, see the manual pages or look in the sources for more
	information.</para>

      <para>That is really all there is to it.  Every time you get a
	new delta, just run it through <application>CTM</application>
	to keep your sources up to date.</para>

      <para>Do not remove the deltas if they are hard to download
	again.  You just might want to keep them around in case
	something bad happens.  Even if you only have floppy disks,
	consider using <command>fdwrite</command> to make a
	copy.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Keeping Your Local Changes</title>

      <para>As a developer one would like to experiment with and
	change files in the source tree.
	<application>CTM</application> supports local modifications in
	a limited way: before checking for the presence of a file
	<filename>foo</filename>, it first looks for
	<filename>foo.ctm</filename>.  If this file exists,
	<application>CTM</application> will operate on it instead of
	<filename>foo</filename>.</para>

      <para>This behavior gives us a simple way to maintain local
	changes: simply copy the files you plan to modify to the
	corresponding file names with a <filename>.ctm</filename>
	suffix.  Then you can freely hack the code, while
	<application>CTM</application> keeps the
	<filename>.ctm</filename> file up-to-date.</para>

	<title>Finding Out Exactly What Would Be Touched by an
	  Update</title>

	<para>You can determine the list of changes that
	  <application>CTM</application> will make on your source
	  repository using the <option>-l</option> option to
	  <application>CTM</application>.</para>

	<para>This is useful if you would like to keep logs of the
	  changes, pre- or post- process the modified files in any
	  manner, or just are feeling a tad paranoid.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Making Backups Before Updating</title>

	<para>Sometimes you may want to backup all the files that
	  would be changed by a <application>CTM</application>
	  update.</para>

	<para>Specifying the <option>-B backup-file</option> option
	  causes <application>CTM</application> to backup all files
	  that would be touched by a given
	  <application>CTM</application> delta to
	  <filename>backup-file</filename>.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Restricting the Files Touched by an Update</title>

	<para>Sometimes you would be interested in restricting the
	  scope of a given <application>CTM</application> update, or
	  may be interested in extracting just a few files from a
	  sequence of deltas.</para>

	<para>You can control the list of files that
	  <application>CTM</application> would operate on by
	  specifying filtering regular expressions using the
	  <option>-e</option> and <option>-x</option> options.</para>

	<para>For example, to extract an up-to-date copy of
	  <filename>lib/libc/Makefile</filename> from your collection
	  of saved <application>CTM</application> deltas, run the
	  commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /where/ever/you/want/to/extract/it/</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ctm -e '^lib/libc/Makefile' ~ctm/src-xxx.*</userinput></screen>

	<para>For every file specified in a
	  <application>CTM</application> delta, the
	  <option>-e</option> and <option>-x</option> options are
	  applied in the order given on the command line.  The file is
	  processed by <application>CTM</application> only if it is
	  marked as eligible after all the <option>-e</option> and
	  <option>-x</option> options are applied to it.</para>

      <para>This example checks out the Ports Collection from the
	western US repository using the <acronym>HTTPS</acronym>
	protocol, placing the local working copy in
	<filename>/usr/ports</filename>.  If
	<filename>/usr/ports</filename> is already
	present but was not created by <command>svn</command>,
	remember to rename or delete it before the checkout.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>svn checkout https://svn0.us-west.FreeBSD.org/ports/head /usr/ports</userinput></screen>

      <para>Because the initial checkout has to download the full
	branch of the remote repository, it can take a while.  Please
	be patient.</para>

      <para>After the initial checkout, the local working copy can be
	updated by running:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>svn update lwcdir</userinput></screen>

      <para>To update
	<filename>/usr/ports</filename> created in
	the example above, use:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>svn update /usr/ports</userinput></screen>

      <para>The update is much quicker than a checkout, only
	transferring files that have changed.</para>

      <para>An alternate way of updating the local working copy after

      </warning>

      <para><application>CVSup</application> is a software package for
	distributing and updating source trees from a master CVS
	repository on a remote server host.  The &os; sources are
	maintained in a CVS repository on a central development
	machine in California.  With <application>CVSup</application>,
	&os; users can easily keep their own source trees up to
	date.</para>

      <para><application>CVSup</application> uses the so-called
	<emphasis>pull</emphasis> model of updating.  Under the pull
	model, each client asks the server for updates, if and when
	they are wanted.  The server waits passively for update
	requests from its clients.  Thus all updates are instigated by
	the client.  The server never sends unsolicited updates.
	Users must either run the <application>CVSup</application>
	client manually to get an update, or they must set up a
	<command>cron</command> job to run it automatically on a
	regular basis.</para>

      <para>The term <application>CVSup</application>, capitalized
	just so, refers to the entire software package.  Its main
	components are the client <command>cvsup</command> which runs
	on each user's machine, and the server
	<command>cvsupd</command> which runs at each of the &os;
	mirror sites.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The <application>csup</application> utility is a rewrite
	  of the <application>CVSup</application> software in C.  Its
	  biggest advantage is, that it is faster and does not depend
	  on the Modula-3 language, thus you do not need to install it
	  as a requirement.  Moreover you can use it out-of-the-box,
	  since it is included in the base system.  If you decided to
	  use <application>csup</application>, just skip the steps on
	  the installation of <application>CVSup</application> and

	      to put your status files?</link></para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In the following sections, we will construct a typical
	<filename>supfile</filename> by answering each of these
	questions in turn.  First, we describe the overall structure
	of a <filename>supfile</filename>.</para>

      <para>A <filename>supfile</filename> is a text file.  Comments
	begin with <literal>#</literal> and extend to the end of the
	line.  Lines that are blank and lines that contain only
	comments are ignored.</para>

      <para>Each remaining line describes a set of files that the user
	wishes to receive.  The line begins with the name of a
	<quote>collection</quote>, a logical grouping of files defined
	by the server.  The name of the collection tells the server
	which files you want.  After the collection name come zero or
	more fields, separated by white space.  These fields answer
	the questions listed above.  There are two types of fields:
	flag fields and value fields.  A flag field consists of a
	keyword standing alone, e.g., <literal>delete</literal> or
	<literal>compress</literal>.  A value field also begins with a
	keyword, but the keyword is followed without intervening white
	space by <literal>=</literal> and a second word.  For example,
	<literal>release=cvs</literal> is a value field.</para>

      <para>A <filename>supfile</filename> typically specifies more
	than one collection to receive.  One way to structure a
	<filename>supfile</filename> is to specify all of the relevant
	fields explicitly for each collection.  However, that tends to
	make the <filename>supfile</filename> lines quite long, and it
	is inconvenient because most fields are the same for all of
	the collections in a <filename>supfile</filename>.
	<application>CVSup</application> provides a defaulting
	mechanism to avoid these problems.  Lines beginning with the
	special pseudo-collection name <literal>*default</literal> can
	be used to set flags and values which will be used as defaults
	for the subsequent collections in the
	<filename>supfile</filename>.  A default value can be
	overridden for an individual collection, by specifying a
	different value with the collection itself.  Defaults can also
	be changed or augmented in mid-supfile by additional
	<literal>*default</literal> lines.</para>

      <para>With this background, we will now proceed to construct a
	<filename>supfile</filename> for receiving and updating the
	main source tree of
	<link linkend="current">&os;-CURRENT</link>.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><anchor xml:id="cvsup-config-files"/>Which files do you
	    want to receive?</para>

	  <para>The files available via
	    <application>CVSup</application> are organized into named
	    groups called <quote>collections</quote>.  The collections
	    that are available are described in the
	    <link linkend="cvsup-collec">following section</link>.  In
	    this example, we wish to receive the entire main source
	    tree for the &os; system.  There is a single large
	    collection <literal>src-all</literal> which will give us
	    all of that.  As a first step toward constructing our
	    <filename>supfile</filename>, we simply list the
	    collections, one per line (in this case, only one
	    line):</para>

	  <programlisting>src-all</programlisting>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><anchor xml:id="cvsup-config-vers"/>Which version(s) of
	    them do you want?</para>

	  <para>With <application>CVSup</application>, you can receive
	    virtually any version of the sources that ever existed.
	    That is possible because the
	    <application>cvsupd</application> server works directly
	    from the CVS repository, which contains all of the
	    versions.  You specify which one of them you want using
	    the <literal>tag=</literal> and <option>date=</option>
	    value fields.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Be very careful to specify any
	      <literal>tag=</literal> fields correctly.  Some tags are
	      valid only for certain collections of files.  If you
	      specify an incorrect or misspelled tag,
	      <application>CVSup</application> will delete files which
	      you probably do not want deleted.  In particular, use
	      <emphasis>only </emphasis> <literal>tag=.</literal> for
	      the <literal>ports-*</literal> collections.</para>
	  </warning>

	  <para>The <literal>tag=</literal> field names a symbolic tag
	    in the repository.  There are two kinds of tags, revision
	    tags and branch tags.  A revision tag refers to a specific
	    revision.  Its meaning stays the same from day to day.  A
	    branch tag, on the other hand, refers to the latest
	    revision on a given line of development, at any given
	    time.  Because a branch tag does not refer to a specific
	    revision, it may mean something different tomorrow than it
	    means today.</para>

	  <para><xref linkend="cvs-tags"/> contains branch tags that
	    users might be interested in.  When specifying a tag in
	    <application>CVSup</application>'s configuration file, it
	    must be preceded with <literal>tag=</literal>
	    (<literal>RELENG_8</literal> will become
	    <literal>tag=RELENG_8</literal>).
	    Keep in mind that only the <literal>tag=.</literal> is
	    relevant for the Ports Collection.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Be very careful to type the tag name exactly as
	      shown.  <application>CVSup</application> cannot
	      distinguish between valid and invalid tags.  If you
	      misspell the tag, <application>CVSup</application> will
	      behave as though you had specified a valid tag which
	      happens to refer to no files at all.  It will delete
	      your existing sources in that case.</para>
	  </warning>

	  <para>When you specify a branch tag, you normally receive
	    the latest versions of the files on that line of
	    development.  If you wish to receive some past version,
	    you can do so by specifying a date with the
	    <option>date=</option> value field.  The &man.cvsup.1;
	    manual page explains how to do that.</para>

	  <para>For our example, we wish to receive &os;-CURRENT.  We
	    add this line at the beginning of our
	    <filename>supfile</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>*default tag=.</programlisting>

	  <para>There is an important special case that comes into
	    play if you specify neither a <literal>tag=</literal>
	    field nor a <literal>date=</literal> field.  In that case,
	    you receive the actual RCS files directly from the
	    server's CVS repository, rather than receiving a
	    particular version.  Developers generally prefer this mode
	    of operation.  By maintaining a copy of the repository
	    itself on their systems, they gain the ability to browse
	    the revision histories and examine past versions of files.
	    This gain is achieved at a large cost in terms of disk
	    space, however.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><anchor xml:id="cvsup-config-where"/>Where do you want to
	    get them from?</para>

	  <para>We use the <literal>host=</literal> field to tell
	    <command>cvsup</command> where to obtain its updates.  Any
	    of the
	    <link linkend="cvsup-mirrors">CVSup mirror sites</link>
	    will do, though you should try to select one that is close
	    to you in cyberspace.  In this example we will use a
	    fictional &os; distribution site,
	    <systemitem class="fqdomainname">cvsup99.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>:</para>

	  <programlisting>*default host=cvsup99.FreeBSD.org</programlisting>

	  <para>You will need to change the host to one that actually
	    exists before running <application>CVSup</application>.
	    On any particular run of <command>cvsup</command>, you can
	    override the host setting on the command line, with
	    <option>-h
	      <replaceable>hostname</replaceable></option>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><anchor xml:id="cvsup-config-dest"/>Where do you want to
	    put them on your own machine?</para>

	  <para>The <literal>prefix=</literal> field tells
	    <command>cvsup</command> where to put the files it
	    receives.  In this example, we will put the source files
	    directly into our main source tree,
	    <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  The
	    <filename>src</filename> directory is already implicit in
	    the collections we have chosen to receive, so this is the
	    correct specification:</para>

	  <programlisting>*default prefix=/usr</programlisting>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><anchor xml:id="cvsup-config-status"/>Where should
	    <command>cvsup</command> maintain its status files?</para>

	  <para>The <application>CVSup</application> client maintains
	    certain status files in what is called the
	    <quote>base</quote> directory.  These files help
	    <application>CVSup</application> to work more efficiently,
	    by keeping track of which updates you have already
	    received.  We will use the standard base directory,
	    <filename>/var/db</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>*default base=/var/db</programlisting>

	  <para>If your base directory does not already exist, now
	    would be a good time to create it.  The
	    <command>cvsup</command> client will refuse to run if the
	    base directory does not exist.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Miscellaneous <filename>supfile</filename>
	    settings:</para>

	  <para>There is one more line of boiler plate that normally
	    needs to be present in the
	    <filename>supfile</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>*default release=cvs delete use-rel-suffix compress</programlisting>

	  <para><literal>release=cvs</literal> indicates that the
	    server should get its information out of the main &os; CVS
	    repository.  This is virtually always the case, but there
	    are other possibilities which are beyond the scope of this
	    discussion.</para>

	  <para><literal>delete</literal> gives
	    <application>CVSup</application> permission to delete
	    files.  You should always specify this, so that
	    <application>CVSup</application> can keep your source tree
	    fully up-to-date.  <application>CVSup</application> is
	    careful to delete only those files for which it is
	    responsible.  Any extra files you happen to have will be
	    left strictly alone.</para>

	  <para><literal>use-rel-suffix</literal> is ... arcane.  If
	    you really want to know about it, see the &man.cvsup.1;
	    manual page.  Otherwise, just specify it and do not worry
	    about it.</para>

	  <para><literal>compress</literal> enables the use of
	    gzip-style compression on the communication channel.  If
	    your network link is T1 speed or faster, you probably
	    should not use compression.  Otherwise, it helps

	<title>The <filename>refuse</filename> File</title>

	<para>As mentioned above, <application>CVSup</application>
	  uses a <emphasis>pull method</emphasis>.  Basically, this
	  means that you connect to the
	  <application>CVSup</application> server, and it says,
	  <quote>Here is what you can download from me...</quote>, and
	  your client responds
	  <quote>OK, I will take this, this, this, and this.</quote>
	  In the default configuration, the
	  <application>CVSup</application> client will take every file
	  associated with the collection and tag you chose in the
	  configuration file.  In order to download a partial tree,
	  use the <filename>refuse</filename> file.</para>

	<para>The <filename>refuse</filename> file tells
	  <application>CVSup</application> that it should not take
	  every single file from a collection; in other words, it
	  tells the client to <emphasis>refuse</emphasis> certain
	  files from the server.  The <filename>refuse</filename> file
	  can be found (or, if you do not yet have one, should be
	  placed) in
	  <filename>base/sup/</filename>.
	  <replaceable>base</replaceable> is defined in your
	  <filename>supfile</filename>; our defined
	  <replaceable>base</replaceable> is
	  <filename>/var/db</filename>, which means that by default
	  the <filename>refuse</filename> file is
	  <filename>/var/db/sup/refuse</filename>.</para>

	<para>The <filename>refuse</filename> file has a very simple
	  format; it simply contains the names of files or directories
	  that you do not wish to download.  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>bin/
usr.bin/</programlisting>

	<para>Users who are on
	  slow links or pay by the minute for their Internet
	  connection will be able to save time as they will
	  no longer need to download files that they will never use.
	  For more information on <filename>refuse</filename> files
	  and other neat features of <application>CVSup</application>,
	  please view its manual page.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Running <application>CVSup</application></title>

      <para>You are now ready to try an update.  The command line for
	doing this is quite simple:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cvsup supfile</userinput></screen>

      <para>where
	<filename>supfile</filename> is of
	course the name of the <filename>supfile</filename> you have
	just created.  Assuming you are running under X11,
	<command>cvsup</command> will display a GUI window with some
	buttons to do the usual things.  Press the
	<guibutton>go</guibutton> button, and watch it run.</para>

      <para>Since you are updating your actual
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> tree in this example, you will
	need to run the program as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> so that
	<command>cvsup</command> has the permissions it needs to
	update your files.  Having just created your configuration
	file, and having never used this program before, that might
	understandably make you nervous.  There is an easy way to do a
	trial run without touching your precious files.  Just create
	an empty directory somewhere convenient, and name it as an
	extra argument on the command line:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/dest</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cvsup supfile /var/tmp/dest</userinput></screen>

      <para>The directory you specify will be used as the destination
	directory for all file updates.
	<application>CVSup</application> will examine your usual files
	in <filename>/usr/src</filename>, but it will not modify or
	delete any of them.  Any file updates will instead land in
	<filename>/var/tmp/dest/usr/src</filename>.
	<application>CVSup</application> will also leave its base
	directory status files untouched when run this way.  The new
	versions of those files will be written into the specified
	directory.  As long as you have read access to
	<filename>/usr/src</filename>, you do not even need to be
	<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> to perform this kind of trial
	run.</para>

      <para>If you are not running X11 or if you just do not like
	GUIs, you should add a couple of options to the command line
	when you run <command>cvsup</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cvsup -g -L 2 supfile</userinput></screen>

      <para>The <option>-g</option> tells
	<application>CVSup</application> not to use its GUI.  This is
	automatic if you are not running X11, but otherwise you have
	to specify it.</para>

      <para>The <option>-L 2</option> tells
	<application>CVSup</application> to print out the
	details of all the file updates it is doing.  There are three
	levels of verbosity, from <option>-L 0</option> to
	<option>-L 2</option>.  The default is 0, which means total
	silence except for error messages.</para>

      <para>There are plenty of other options available.  For a brief
	list of them, type <command>cvsup -H</command>.  For more
	detailed descriptions, see the manual page.</para>

      <para>Once you are satisfied with the way updates are working,
	you can arrange for regular runs of
	<application>CVSup</application> using &man.cron.8;.
	Obviously, you should not let <application>CVSup</application>
	use its GUI when running it from &man.cron.8;.</para>

      <para>These tags refer to a specific point in time when a
	particular version of &os; was released.  The release
	engineering process is documented in more detail by the
	<link xlink:href="&url.base;/releng/">Release Engineering
	  Information</link> and
	<link xlink:href="&url.articles.releng;/release-proc.html">Release
	  Process</link> documents.  The

	that start with <literal>RELENG_</literal> tags.  The
	<filename>ports</filename> and
	<filename>doc</filename> trees use tags
	whose names begin with <literal>RELEASE</literal> tags.
	Finally, the <filename>www</filename> tree
	is not tagged with any special name for releases.</para>

    <para>The following sites make &os; available through the rsync
      protocol.  The <application>rsync</application> utility works in
      much the same way as the &man.rcp.1; command,
      but has more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol
      which transfers only the differences between two sets of files,
      thus greatly speeding up the synchronization over the network.
      This is most useful if you are a mirror site for the
      &os; FTP server, or the CVS repository.  The
      <application>rsync</application> suite is available for many
      operating systems, on &os;, see the
      <package>net/rsync</package>
      port or use the package.</para>

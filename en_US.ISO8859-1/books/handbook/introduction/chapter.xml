    <title>Welcome to &os;!</title>

    <indexterm><primary>4.4BSD-Lite</primary></indexterm>

    <para>&os; is an Open Source, standards-compliant Unix-like
      operating system for x86 (both 32 and 64 bit), &arm;, AArch64,
      &risc-v;, &mips;, &power;, &powerpc;, and Sun &ultrasparc;
      computers.  It provides all the features that are
      nowadays taken for granted, such as preemptive multitasking,
      memory protection, virtual memory, multi-user facilities, SMP
      support, all the Open Source development tools for different
      languages and frameworks, and desktop features centered around
      X Window System, KDE, or GNOME.  Its particular strengths
      are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Liberal Open Source license</emphasis>,
	  which grants you rights to freely modify and extend
	  its source code and incorporate it in both Open Source
	  projects and closed products without imposing
	  restrictions typical to copyleft licenses, as well
	  as avoiding potential license incompatibility
	  problems.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Strong TCP/IP networking</emphasis>
	  <indexterm> <primary>TCP/IP
	      networking</primary></indexterm> - &os;
	  implements industry standard protocols with ever
	  increasing performance and scalability.  This makes
	  it a good match in both server, and routing/firewalling
	  roles - and indeed many companies and vendors use it
	  precisely for that purpose.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Fully integrated OpenZFS support</emphasis>,
	  including root-on-ZFS, ZFS Boot Environments, fault
	  management, administrative delegation, support for jails,
	  &os; specific documentation, and system installer
	  support.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Extensive security features</emphasis>,
	  from the Mandatory Access Control framework to Capsicum
	  capability and sandbox mechanisms.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Over 30 thousand prebuilt
	    packages</emphasis> for all supported architectures,
	  and the Ports Collection which makes it easy to build your
	  own, customized ones.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Documentation</emphasis> - in addition
	  to Handbook and books from different authors that cover
	  topics ranging from system administration to kernel
	  internals, there are also the &man.man.1; pages, not only
	  for userspace daemons, utilities, and configuration files,
	  but also for kernel driver APIs (section 9) and individual
	  drivers (section 4).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Simple and consistent repository structure
	    and build system</emphasis> - &os; uses a single
	  repository for all of its components, both kernel and
	  userspace.  This, along with an unified and easy to
	  customize build system and a well thought out development
	  process makes it easy to integrate &os; with build
	  infrastructure for your own product.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Staying true to Unix philosophy</emphasis>,
	  preferring composability instead of monolithic <quote>all

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><indexterm> <primary>binary compatibility</primary>

	  which makes it possible to run many Linux binaries without
	  the need for virtualisation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>&os; is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite<indexterm>
	<primary>4.4BSD-Lite</primary>
      </indexterm> release from Computer
      Systems Research Group (CSRG)<indexterm>
	<primary>Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG)</primary>
      </indexterm> at the University of California at Berkeley, and
      carries on the distinguished tradition of BSD systems
      development.  In addition to the fine work provided by CSRG,
      the &os;&nbsp;Project has put in many thousands of man-hours
      into extending the functionality and fine-tuning the system
      for maximum performance and reliability
      in real-life load situations.  &os; offers performance and
      reliability on par with other Open Source and commercial
      offerings, combined with cutting-edge features not available
      anywhere else.</para>

      <title>What Can &os; Do?</title>

      <para>The applications to which &os; can be put are truly
	limited only by your own imagination.  From software
	development to factory automation, inventory control to
	azimuth correction of remote satellite antennae; if it can be
	done with a commercial &unix; product then it is more than
	likely that you can do it with &os; too!  &os; also benefits
	significantly from literally thousands of high quality
	applications developed by research centers and universities
	around the world, often available at little to no cost.</para>

      <para>Because the source code for &os; itself is freely
	available, the system can also be customized to an almost
	unheard of degree for special applications or projects, and in
	ways not generally possible with operating systems from most
	major commercial vendors.  Here is just a sampling of some of
	the applications in which people are currently using

	<secondary>history</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The &os;&nbsp;Project had its genesis in the early part
	of 1993, partially as the brainchild of the Unofficial
	386BSDPatchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate Williams,
	Rod Grimes and Jordan Hubbard.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>386BSD</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot
	of 386BSD in order to fix a number of problems that
	the patchkit mechanism was just not capable of solving.  The
	early working title for the project was 386BSD 0.5 or 386BSD
	Interim in reference of that fact.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Jolitz, Bill</primary></indexterm>
      <para>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been
	up to that point suffering rather severely from almost a
	year's worth of neglect.  As the patchkit swelled ever more
	uncomfortably with each passing day, they decided to assist
	Bill by providing this interim <quote>cleanup</quote>
	snapshot.  Those plans came to a rude halt when Bill Jolitz
	suddenly decided to withdraw his sanction from the project
	without any clear indication of what would be done
	instead.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Greenman, David</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Walnut Creek CDROM</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The trio thought that the goal remained worthwhile, even
	without Bill's support, and so they adopted the name "&os;"
	coined by David Greenman.  The initial objectives were set
	after consulting with the system's current users and, once it
	became clear that the project was on the road to perhaps even
	becoming a reality, Jordan contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with
	an eye toward improving &os;'s distribution channels for those
	many unfortunates without easy access to the Internet.  Walnut
	Creek CDROM not only supported the idea of distributing &os;
	on CD but also went so far as to provide the project with a
	machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  Without
	Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in
	what was, at the time, a completely unknown project, it is
	quite unlikely that &os; would have gotten as far, as fast, as
	it has today.</para>

      <para>The first CD-ROM (and general net-wide) distribution was
	&os;&nbsp;1.0, released in December of 1993.  This was based
	on the 4.3BSD-Lite (<quote>Net/2</quote>) tape from U.C.
	Berkeley, with many components also provided by 386BSD and the
	Free Software Foundation.  It was a fairly reasonable success
	for a first offering, and they followed it with the highly
	successful &os; 1.1 release in May of 1994.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Novell</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>U.C. Berkeley</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Net/2</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>AT&amp;T</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds
	formed on the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled
	their long-running lawsuit over the legal status of the
	Berkeley Net/2 tape.  A condition of that settlement was U.C.
	Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were
	<quote>encumbered</quote> code and the property of Novell, who
	had in turn acquired it from AT&amp;T some time previously.
	What Berkeley got in return was Novell's
	<quote>blessing</quote> that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when
	it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered and
	all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to
	switch.  This included &os;, and the project was given until
	the end of July 1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based
	product.  Under the terms of that agreement, the project was
	allowed one last release before the deadline, that release
	being &os;&nbsp;1.1.5.1.</para>

      <para>&os; then set about the arduous task of literally
	re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather
	incomplete set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits.  The <quote>Lite</quote>
	releases were light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had
	removed large chunks of code required for actually
	constructing a bootable running system (due to various legal
	requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was
	highly incomplete.  It took the project until November of 1994
	to make this transition, and in December it released
	&os;&nbsp;2.0 to the world.  Despite being still more than a
	little rough around the edges, the release was a significant
	success and was followed by the more robust and easier to
	install &os;&nbsp;2.0.5 release in June of 1995.</para>

      <para>Since that time, &os; has made a series of releases each
	time improving the stability, speed, and feature set of the
	previous version.</para>

      <para>For now, long-term development projects continue to take
	place in the 10.X-CURRENT (trunk) branch, and snapshot
	releases of 10.X are continually made available from <link
	  xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/">the
	  snapshot server</link> as work progresses.</para>

      <para>The goals of the &os;&nbsp;Project are to provide software
	that may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.
	Many of us have a significant investment in the code (and
	project) and would certainly not mind a little financial
	compensation now and then, but we are definitely not prepared
	to insist on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
	<quote>mission</quote> is to provide code to any and all
	comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the
	widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
	This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
	Software and one that we enthusiastically support.</para>

	software submitted under the more relaxed BSD license when
	it is a reasonable option to do so.</para>

	      For several years, the central source tree for &os;

	      <link xlink:href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</link>
	      (Concurrent Versions System), a freely available source
	      code control tool.  In June 2008, the Project switched
	      to using <link
		xlink:href="http://subversion.tigris.org">SVN</link>
	      (Subversion).  The switch was deemed necessary, as the
	      technical limitations imposed by
	      <application>CVS</application> were becoming obvious due
	      to the rapid expansion of the source tree and the amount
	      of history already stored.  The Documentation Project
	      and Ports Collection repositories also moved from

      <para>In addition to the base distributions, &os; offers a

	sought-after programs.  At the time of this writing, there
	were over &os.numports; ports!  The list of ports ranges from
	http servers, to games, languages, editors, and almost
	everything in between.  The entire Ports Collection requires
	approximately &ports.size;.  To compile a port, you simply
	change to the directory of the program you wish to install,
	type <command>make install</command>, and let the system do
	the rest.  The full original distribution for each port you
	build is retrieved dynamically so you need only enough disk
	space to build the ports you want.  Almost every port is also
	provided as a pre-compiled <quote>package</quote>, which can
	be installed with a simple command
	(<command>pkg install</command>) by those who do not wish to
	compile their own ports from source.  More information on

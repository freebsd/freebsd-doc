    <indexterm><primary>installation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>&os; provides a text-based, easy to use installation
      program.  &os; 9.0-RELEASE and later use the installation program
      known as &man.bsdinstall.8;
      while &os;&nbsp;8.<replaceable>X</replaceable> uses
      &man.sysinstall.8;.  This chapter describes
      how to use &man.sysinstall.8;.
      The use of &man.bsdinstall.8;
      is covered in <xref linkend="bsdinstall"/>.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

    <note>
      <para>In general, these installation instructions are written
	for the &i386; and &os;/&arch.amd64; architectures.
	Where applicable, instructions specific to other
	platforms will be listed.  There may be minor
	differences between the installer and what is shown here.
	This chapter should be used as a general guide rather
	than a literal installation manual.</para>

    <title>Hardware Requirements</title>

    <sect2 id="install-hardware-minimal">
      <title>Minimal Configuration</title>

      <para>The minimal configuration to install &os; varies with the
	&os; version and the hardware architecture.</para>

      <para>A summary of this information is given in the following sections.
	Depending on the method chosen to install &os;,
	a floppy drive, CDROM drive, or
	network adapter may be needed.  Instructions on how to
	prepare the installation media can be found in
	<xref linkend="install-boot-media"/>.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.i386; and &os;/&arch.pc98;</title>

	<para>Both &os;/&arch.i386; and &os;/&arch.pc98; require a 486 or
	  better processor, at least 24&nbsp;MB of RAM, and at
	  least 150&nbsp;MB of free hard drive space for the
	  most minimal installation.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In the case of older hardware, installing more RAM and
	    more hard drive space is often more important than
	    a faster processor.</para>
	</note>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.amd64;</title>

	<para>There are two classes of processors capable of running
	  &os;/&arch.amd64;.  The first are AMD64 processors,
	  including the &amd.athlon;64,
	  &amd.athlon;64-FX, and &amd.opteron; or better
	  processors.</para>

	<para>The second class of processors
	  includes those using the &intel; EM64T
	  architecture.  Examples of these processors include the
	  &intel;&nbsp;&core;&nbsp;2 Duo, Quad, Extreme processor
	  families, and the &intel;&nbsp;&xeon; 3000, 5000, and 7000
	  sequences of processors.</para>

	<para>If the machine is based on an nVidia nForce3
	  Pro-150, the BIOS setup <emphasis>must</emphasis> be used to
	  disable the IO APIC.  If this option does not exist,
	  disable ACPI instead as there
	  are bugs in the Pro-150 chipset.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.sparc64;</title>

	<para>To install &os;/&arch.sparc64;, use a supported
	  platform (see <xref
	  linkend="install-hardware-supported"/>).</para>

	<para>A dedicated disk is needed for &os;/&arch.sparc64; as
	  it is not possible to share a disk with another operating
	  system at this time.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-hardware-supported">
      <title>Supported Hardware</title>

      <para>A list of supported hardware is provided with each &os;
	release in the &os; Hardware Notes.  This document can usually
	be found in a file named <filename>HARDWARE.TXT</filename>, in
	the top-level directory of a CDROM or FTP distribution, or in
	&man.sysinstall.8;'s documentation menu.
	It lists, for a given architecture, which hardware devices are
	known to be supported by each release of &os;.  Copies of the
	supported hardware list for various releases and architectures
	can also be found on the <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Release

    <sect2 id="install-inventory">
      <title>Inventory the Computer</title>

      <para>Before installing &os; it is recommended to inventory the
	components in the computer.  The &os; installation routines
	will show components such as hard disks, network cards,
	and CDROM drives with their model number and manufacturer.
	&os; will also
	attempt to determine the correct configuration for these devices,
	including information about IRQ and I/O port usage.  Due
	to the
	vagaries of computer hardware, this process is not always
	completely
	successful, and &os; may need some manual
	configuration.</para>

      <para>If another operating system is already installed,
	use the facilities provided
	by that operating systems to view the hardware configuration.
	If the settings of an expansion
	card are not obvious, check if they are printed on the
	card itself.  Popular IRQ
	numbers are 3, 5, and 7, and I/O port addresses are normally
	written as
	hexadecimal numbers, such as <literal>0x330</literal>.</para>

      <para>It is recommended to print or write down this information
	before
	installing &os;.  It may help to use a table, as seen in this
	example:</para>

      <title>Make a Backup</title>

      <para>If the computer contains
	valuable data, ensure it is backed up, and that the backup
	has been
	tested before installing &os;.  The &os;
	installer will prompt before writing any
	data to disk, but once that process has started, it cannot be
	undone.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-where">
      <title>Decide Where to Install &os;</title>

      <para>If &os; is to be installed on the entire hard disk,
	skip this
	section.</para>

      <para>However, if &os; will co-exist with other operating
	systems, a rough understanding of how data is
	laid out on the disk is useful.</para>

      <sect3 id="install-where-i386">
	<title>Disk Layouts for &os;/&arch.i386;</title>

      <para>A PC disk can be divided into discrete chunks known as
	<firstterm>partitions</firstterm>. Since
	&os; also has partitions, naming
	can quickly become confusing.  Therefore, these
	disk chunks are referred to as slices
	in &os;.  For example, the &os; version of
	&man.fdisk.8;
	refers to slices instead of partitions.  By design, the PC only
	supports four partitions per disk.  These partitions are called
	<firstterm>primary partitions</firstterm>.  To work around this
	limitation and allow more than four partitions, a new partition type
	was created, the <firstterm>extended partition</firstterm>.  A disk
	may contain only one extended partition.  Special partitions, called
	<firstterm>logical partitions</firstterm>, can be created inside this
	extended partition.</para>

      <para>Each partition has a <firstterm>partition ID</firstterm>, which is
	a number used to identify the type of data on the partition.  &os;
	partitions have the partition ID of <literal>165</literal>.</para>

      <para>In general, each operating system will identify
	partitions in a particular way.  For example,
	&windows;, assigns each primary and logical partition a
	<firstterm>drive letter</firstterm>, starting with
	<devicename>C:</devicename>.</para>

      <para>&os; must be installed into a primary partition.  If
	there are multiple disks, a &os;
	partition can be created
	on all, or some, of them.  When &os; is installed, at least
	one partition must be available.  This might be a blank
	partition or it might be an existing partition whose
	data can be overwritten.</para>

      <para>If all the partitions on all the disks are in use,
	free one of them for &os; using the tools
	provided by an existing operating system, such as &windows;
	<command>fdisk</command>.</para>

      <para>If there is a spare partition, use that.  If it is too
	small,
	shrink one or more existing partitions to create more
	available space.</para>

      <para>A minimal installation of &os; takes as little as 100&nbsp;MB
	of disk
	space.  However, that is a <emphasis>very</emphasis> minimal install,
	leaving almost no space for files.  A more realistic minimum
	is 250&nbsp;MB without a graphical environment, and 350&nbsp;MB or
	more for
	a graphical user interface.  If other
	third-party software will be installed,
	even more space is needed.</para>

      <para>You can use a tool such as <application>GParted</application>
	to resize your partitions and make space for
	&os;.  <application>GParted</application> is known to work on
	<acronym>NTFS</acronym> and
	is available on a number of Live CD Linux distributions, such as
	<ulink url="http://www.sysresccd.org/">SystemRescueCD</ulink>.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>Incorrect use of a shrinking tool can delete the data
	  on the disk.
	  Always have a recent, working backup before using this
	  type of tool.</para>
      </warning>

      <example>
	<title>Using an Existing Partition Unchanged</title>

	<para>Consider a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk
	  that
	  already has a version of &windows; installed, where the
	  disk has been split into two drive letters,
	  <devicename>C:</devicename> and
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>, each of which is 2&nbsp;GB in size.
	  There is 1&nbsp;GB of data on <devicename>C:</devicename>,
	  and
	  0.5&nbsp;GB of data on
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>.</para>

	<para>This disk has two partitions, one per
	  drive letter.  Copy all existing data from
	  <devicename>D:</devicename> to <devicename>C:</devicename>, which
	  will free up the second partition, ready for &os;.</para>
      </example>

      <example>
	<title>Shrinking an Existing Partition</title>

	<para>Consider a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk
	  that already has a version of &windows; installed.  When
	  &windows; was installed, it created one large partition,
	  a
	  <devicename>C:</devicename> drive that is 4&nbsp;GB in size.
	  Currently, 1.5&nbsp;GB of space is used, and &os; should

      <para>To create the boot floppy images for a &os;/&arch.pc98;
	installation, follow these steps:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Acquire the Boot Floppy Images</title>

	  <para>The &os;/&arch.pc98; boot disks
	    can be downloaded from the floppies directory,
	    <literal>ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/pc98/<replaceable>version</replaceable>-RELEASE/floppies/</literal>.
	    Replace <replaceable>version</replaceable> with the
	    version number to install.</para>

	  <para>The floppy images have a <filename>.flp</filename>
	    extension.  <filename
	      class="directory">floppies/</filename> contains a number
	    of different images.  Download
	    <filename>boot.flp</filename> as well as the number of
	    files associated with the type of installation, such as
	    <literal>kern.small*</literal> or
	    <literal>kern*</literal>.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>The FTP program must use <emphasis>binary
		mode</emphasis>
	      to download these disk images.  Some web browsers
	      use <emphasis>text</emphasis> or
	      <emphasis>ASCII</emphasis> mode, which will be apparent
	      if
	      the disks are not bootable.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Prepare the Floppy Disks</title>

	  <para>Prepare one floppy disk per downloaded image file.
	    It is imperative that these disks are free from
	    defects.  The easiest way to test this is to reformat the
	    disks.
	    Do not trust pre-formatted floppies.  The format
	    utility in &windows; will not tell about the presence of
	    bad blocks, it simply marks them as <quote>bad</quote>
	    and ignores them.  It is advised to use brand new
	    floppies.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>If the installer
	      crashes, freezes, or otherwise misbehaves, one of
	      the first things to suspect is the floppies.  Write
	      the floppy image files to new disks and try
	      again.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Write the Image Files to the Floppy Disks</title>

	  <para>The <filename>.flp</filename> files are
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> regular files that can be copied
	    to the disk.
	    They are images of the complete contents of the
	    disk.
	    Specific tools must be used to write the
	    images directly to the disk.</para>

	  <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>&os; provides a tool called
	    <command>rawrite</command> for creating the floppies on a
	    computer running
	    &windows;.  This tool can be downloaded from
	    <literal>ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/pc98/<replaceable>
	      version</replaceable>-RELEASE/tools/</literal>
	    on the &os; FTP site.  Download this tool, insert a
	    floppy, then specify the filename to write to the floppy
	    drive:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>rawrite boot.flp A:</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Repeat this command for each <filename>.flp</filename>
	    file, replacing the floppy disk each time, being sure to label
	    the disks with the name of the file.
	    Adjust the command line as necessary, depending on where
	    the <filename>.flp</filename> files are located.</para>

	  <para>When writing the floppies on a &unix;-like system,
	    such as
	    another &os; system, use &man.dd.1; to
	    write the image files directly to disk.  On &os;,
	    run:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=boot.flp of=/dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>On &os;, <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> refers to the
	    first floppy disk.  Other &unix;
	    variants might have different names for the floppy disk
	    device, so check the documentation for the
	    system as necessary.</para>

      <para>In a PC running a BIOS-dependent operating system such as
	&microsoft.windows;, the BIOS is able to abstract the
	normal disk drive order and
	the operating system goes along with the change.  This allows the user
	to boot from a disk drive other than the "primary
	master".  This is especially convenient for users
	buy an identical second hard drive, and perform routine copies of the
	first drive to the second drive.
	If the
	first drive fails, is attacked by a virus, or is scribbled upon by an
	operating system defect, they can easily recover by instructing the BIOS
	to logically swap the drives.  It is like switching the cables on the
	drives, without having to open the case.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>BIOS</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Systems with SCSI controllers often include BIOS

	<title>An Illustration from the Files of Bill and Fred's Exceptional
	  Adventures:</title>

	<para>Bill breaks-down an older Wintel box to make another &os; box
	  for Fred.  Bill installs a single SCSI drive as SCSI unit zero and
	  installs &os; on it.</para>

	<para>Fred begins using the system, but after several days notices that
	  the older SCSI drive is reporting numerous
	  errors.</para>

	<para>To address the
	  situation, Bill grabs an identical SCSI drive and installs
	  this drive as SCSI
	  unit four and makes an image copy from drive zero to drive four.  Now
	  that the new drive is installed and functioning, Bill
	  decides
	  to start using it, so he uses features in the
	  SCSI BIOS to re-order the disk drives so that the system boots from
	  SCSI unit four.  &os; boots and runs just fine.</para>

	<para>Fred continues his work and soon
	  decides that it is time to upgrade
	  to a
	  newer version of &os;.  Bill removes SCSI unit zero because it was
	  a bit flaky and replaces it with another identical disk
	  drive.  Bill then installs the new version of
	  &os; onto the new SCSI unit zero and the installation goes
	  well.</para>

	<para>Fred uses the new version of &os; for a few days, and certifies
	  that it is good enough for use in the engineering department.  It is
	  time to copy all of his work from the old version, so Fred
	  mounts
	  SCSI unit four which should contain the latest copy of the
	  older
	  &os; version.  Fred
	  is dismayed to find that none of his work is present on SCSI
	  unit four.</para>

	<para>It turns out that when Bill made an image copy of the
	  original SCSI unit zero onto
	  SCSI unit four, unit four became the <quote>new clone</quote>.
	  When Bill re-ordered the SCSI BIOS so that he could boot from
	  SCSI unit four,
	  &os; was still running on SCSI unit zero.
	  Making this kind of BIOS change causes some or all of the
	  boot and
	  loader code to be fetched from the selected BIOS drive.  But
	  when the
	  &os; kernel drivers take over, the BIOS drive numbering is
	  ignored, and &os; transitions back to normal drive
	  numbering.
	  In this example, the system continued to operate on the
	  original SCSI unit zero, and all of Fred's data was there, not on SCSI
	  unit four.  The fact that the system appeared to be running on SCSI
	  unit four was simply an artifact of human expectations.</para>

	<para>Fortunately, the older SCSI
	  unit zero was retrieved and all of Fred's work was
	  restored.</para>

	<para>Although SCSI drives were used in this illustration, the concepts
	  apply equally to IDE drives.</para>

 In the next menu, you will need to set up a DOS-style ("fdisk")

      <para>Note that <devicename>ad1</devicename> is not

      <para>Consider two IDE hard disks where one
	is the master on the first IDE controller and one is the

	<devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad1</devicename>, everything would work.</para>

      <para>But if a third disk is later added as the slave device on
	the

	and the previous <devicename>ad1</devicename> would become
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>.  Because device names
	are used to find filesystems,

      <para>To work around this, the kernel can be configured to name IDE

 Would you like to install the FreeBSD ports collection?

 This will give you ready access to over &os.numports; ported software packages,
 at a cost of around &ports.size; of disk space when "clean" and possibly much
 more than that if a lot of the distribution tarballs are loaded
 (unless you have the extra CDs from a FreeBSD CD/DVD distribution
 available and can mount it on /cdrom, in which case this is far less
 of a problem).

 The Ports Collection is a very valuable resource and well worth having
 on your /usr partition, so it is advisable to say Yes to this option.

	active FTP, passive FTP, or via a HTTP proxy.</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>FTP Active: <guimenuitem>Install from an FTP
	      server</guimenuitem></term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>This option makes all FTP transfers
	      use <quote>Active</quote>
	      mode.  This will not work through firewalls, but will
	      often work with older FTP servers that do not support
	      passive mode.  If the connection hangs with passive
	      mode (the default), try using active mode.</para>
	  </listitem>

	      <primary>FTP</primary>
	      <secondary>passive mode</secondary>
	    </indexterm>

	    <para>This option instructs &man.sysinstall.8;
	      to use passive mode for all FTP
	      operations.
	      This allows the user to pass through firewalls
	      that do not allow incoming connections on random TCP ports.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>FTP via a HTTP proxy: <guimenuitem>Install from an FTP server

	    <indexterm>
	      <primary>FTP</primary>
	      <secondary>via a HTTP proxy</secondary>
	    </indexterm>

	    <para>This option instructs &man.sysinstall.8;
	      to use the HTTP
	      protocol to connect to a proxy
	      for all FTP operations.  The proxy will translate
	      the requests and send them to the FTP server.
	      This allows the user to pass through firewalls
	      that do not allow FTP, but offer a HTTP
	      proxy.
	      In this case, specify the proxy in
	      addition to the FTP server.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>For a proxy FTP server, give the name of the
	server as part of the username, after an
	<quote>@</quote> sign.  The proxy server then <quote>fakes</quote>
	the real server.  For example, to install from
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, using the proxy FTP
	server <hostid role="fqdn">foo.example.com</hostid>, listening on port
	1234, go to the options menu, set the FTP username
	to <literal>ftp@ftp.FreeBSD.org</literal> and the password to
	an
	email address.  As the installation media, specify FTP (or
	passive FTP, if the proxy supports it), and the URL
	<literal>ftp://foo.example.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD</literal>.</para>

      <para>Since <filename class="directory">/pub/FreeBSD</filename>
	from
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> is proxied under
	<hostid role="fqdn">foo.example.com</hostid>, the proxy
	will fetch the files
	from <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> as the
	installer requests them.</para>

inetd(8) relies on its configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf, to determine
which of its Internet services will be available.  The default FreeBSD
inetd.conf(5) leaves all services disabled by default, so they must be
specifically enabled in the configuration file before they will
function, even once inetd(8) is enabled.  Note that services for
IPv6 must be separately enabled from IPv4 services.

 Anonymous FTP permits un-authenticated users to connect to the system
 FTP server, if FTP service is enabled.  Anonymous users are
 restricted to a specific subset of the file system, and the default
 configuration provides a drop-box incoming directory to which uploads
 are permitted.  You must separately enable both inetd(8), and enable
 ftpd(8) in inetd.conf(5) for FTP services to be available.  If you
 did not do so earlier, you will have the opportunity to enable inetd(8)
 again later.

 If you want the server to be read-only you should leave the upload
 directory option empty and add the -r command-line option to ftpd(8)
 in inetd.conf(5)

      <title>Configure Additional Network Services</title>

      <para>Configuring network services can be a daunting
	task for users that lack previous
	knowledge in this area.  Since networking and the Internet
	are critical to all modern operating systems,
	it is useful to have some understanding of
	&os;'s extensive networking capabilities.</para>

      <para>Network services are programs that accept input from
	anywhere on the network.  Since
	there have been cases where bugs in network services have been
	exploited by attackers, it is important to
	only enable needed network services.  If
	in doubt, do not enable a network service until
	it is needed.  Services can be enabled
	with &man.sysinstall.8; or by
	editing
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenu>Networking</guimenu> option will display
	a menu similar to the one below:</para>

      <figure id="network-configuration">
	<title>Network Configuration Upper-level</title>

	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="install/net-config-menu1"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The first option, <guimenuitem>Interfaces</guimenuitem>,
	is covered in <xref linkend="inst-network-dev"/>.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenuitem>AMD</guimenuitem> option adds
	support for &man.amd.8;.
	This is usually used in conjunction with
	<acronym>NFS</acronym>
	for automatically mounting remote filesystems.</para>

      <para>Next is the <guimenuitem>AMD Flags</guimenuitem>
	option.  When selected, a menu will pop up where
	specific <acronym>AMD</acronym> flags can be entered.
	The menu already contains a set of default options:</para>

      <screen>-a /.amd_mnt -l syslog /host /etc/amd.map /net /etc/amd.map</screen>

      <para><option>-a</option> sets the default mount
	location which is specified here as
	<filename>/.amd_mnt</filename>.  <option>-l</option>
	specifies the default <filename>log</filename>;
	however, when &man.syslogd.8; is used, all log
	activity will be sent to the system log daemon.
	<filename class="directory">/host</filename> is used
	to mount an exported file system from a remote
	host, while <filename class="directory">/net</filename>
	is used to mount an exported filesystem from an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address.  The default
	options for <acronym>AMD</acronym> exports are defined in
	<filename>/etc/amd.map</filename>.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>FTP</primary>
	<secondary>anonymous</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Anon FTP</guimenuitem> option permits anonymous
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> connections.  Select this option to
	make this machine an anonymous <acronym>FTP</acronym> server.
	Be aware of the security risks involved with this option.
	Another menu will be displayed to explain the security risks
	and configuration in depth.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> menu will configure
	the machine to be a gateway.  This menu
	can also be used to unset the
	<guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> option if
	it was accidentally selected during installation.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Inetd</guimenuitem> option can be used to configure
	or completely disable &man.inetd.8;.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Mail</guimenuitem> option is used to configure the
	system's default Mail Transfer Agent (<acronym>MTA</acronym>).
	Selecting this option will bring up the following menu:</para>

      <figure id="mta-selection">
	<title>Select a Default MTA</title>

	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="install/mta-main"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>This menu offers a choice as to which
	<acronym>MTA</acronym> to install
	and set as the default.  An <acronym>MTA</acronym> is
	a mail server which delivers email to users on the
	system or the Internet.</para>

      <para>Select <guimenuitem>Sendmail</guimenuitem> to install
	<application>Sendmail</application> as the default
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>.  Select
	<guimenuitem>Sendmail local</guimenuitem>
	to set <application>Sendmail</application> as the
	default
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>, but disable its ability to receive
	incoming email from the Internet.  The other options,
	<guimenuitem>Postfix</guimenuitem> and
	<guimenuitem>Exim</guimenuitem>, provide
	alternatives to
	<application>Sendmail</application>.</para>

      <para>The next menu after the <acronym>MTA</acronym> menu is
	<guimenuitem>NFS client</guimenuitem>.  This menu is used to
	configure the system to communicate with a
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> server which in turn is used to
	make filesystems available to other machines on the
	network over the <acronym>NFS</acronym> protocol.
	See
	<xref linkend="network-nfs"/> for more
	information about client and server configuration.</para>

      <para>Below that option is the <guimenuitem>NFS server</guimenuitem>
	option, for setting the system up as an
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> server.  This adds the required
	information to start up the Remote Procedure
	Call <acronym>RPC</acronym>
	services.  <acronym>RPC</acronym> is used to
	coordinate connections between hosts and programs.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>Ntpdate</guimenuitem> option,
	which deals with time synchronization.  When selected, a menu
	like the one below shows up:</para>

      <figure id="Ntpdate-config">
	<title>Ntpdate Configuration</title>

	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="install/ntp-config"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>From this menu, select the server which is geographically
	closest.
	This will make the time
	synchronization more accurate as a farther server
	may have more connection latency.</para>

      <para>The next option is the <acronym>PCNFSD</acronym> selection.
	This option will install the
	<filename role="package">net/pcnfsd</filename> package from
	the Ports Collection.  This is a useful utility which provides
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> authentication services for systems which
	are unable to provide their own, such as Microsoft's
	&ms-dos; operating system.</para>

      <para>Now, scroll down a bit to see the other
	options:</para>

      <figure id="Network-configuration-cont">
	<title>Network Configuration Lower-level</title>

	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="install/net-config-menu2"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para><acronym>RPC</acronym>.
	communication
	between <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients is managed
	by &man.rpcbind.8; which is
	required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers to operate
	correctly.  Status monitoring is provided by
	&man.rpc.statd.8; and the reported status is usually held
	in <filename>/var/db/statd.status</filename>.  The
	next option is for &man.rpc.lockd.8;
	which provides file locking
	services.  This is usually used with
	&man.rpc.statd.8; to monitor which hosts are
	requesting locks and how frequently they request them.
	While these last two options are useful for debugging, they
	are not required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients
	to operate correctly.</para>

      <para>The next menu,
	<guimenuitem>Routed</guimenuitem>, configures the routing
	daemon.
	&man.routed.8;, manages network routing tables,
	discovers multicast routers, and supplies a copy of the routing
	tables to any physically connected host on the network upon
	request.  This is mainly used for machines which act as a
	gateway for the local network.  If selected, a menu will
	request the default location of the utility.
	To accept the default location,
	press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Yet
	another menu will ask for the
	flags to pass to &man.routed.8;.  The
	default of <option>-q</option> should appear
	on the screen.</para>

      <para>The next menu, <guimenuitem>Rwhod</guimenuitem>,
	starts &man.rwhod.8;
	during system initialization.  This
	utility broadcasts system messages across the network
	periodically, or collects them when in <quote>consumer</quote>
	mode.  More information can be found in &man.ruptime.1; and
	&man.rwho.1;.</para>

      <para>The next to last option in the list is for
	&man.sshd.8;, the secure shell server for
	<application>OpenSSH</application>.  It is highly recommended
	over the standard &man.telnetd.8; and
	&man.ftpd.8; servers as it
	is used to create a secure, encrypted connection from one host
	to
	another.</para>

      <para>The final option is <guimenuitem>TCP
	  Extensions</guimenuitem> which are
	defined in <acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1323 and
	<acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1644.  While on many hosts this can
	speed up connections, it can also cause some connections to be
	dropped.  It is not recommended for servers, but may be
	beneficial for stand alone machines.</para>

      <para>Once the network services are configured,
	scroll up to the very top item which is
	<guimenuitem>X Exit</guimenuitem>
	and continue on to the next configuration item or simply exit
	&man.sysinstall.8; by selecting
	<guimenuitem>X Exit</guimenuitem> twice then <guibutton>[X
	Exit Install]</guibutton>.</para>

      <title>If Something Goes Wrong</title>

      <para>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is
	impossible for device probing to be 100% reliable.  However,
	there are a
	few things to try if it fails.</para>

      <para>Check the <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Hardware Notes
	</ulink> document for the version of &os; to make sure the
	hardware is supported.</para>

      <para>If the hardware is supported but still experiences
	lock-ups or other problems, build a <link
	linkend="kernelconfig">custom kernel</link>
	to add in support for devices which are not present in the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  The default kernel
	assumes that most hardware devices are in their
	factory default configuration in terms of IRQs, I/O addresses,
	and
	DMA channels.  If the hardware has been reconfigured,
	create a custom kernel configuration file and recompile to
	tell
	&os; where to find things.</para>

      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present
	will
	cause a later probe for another device that is present to fail.  In
	that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s) should be
	disabled.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Some installation problems can be avoided or alleviated
	  by updating the firmware on various hardware components, most notably
	  the motherboard
	  <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.  Most motherboard and computer
	  manufacturers have a website where upgrade
	  information may be located.</para>

	<para>Most manufacturers strongly advise against upgrading the
	  motherboard <acronym>BIOS</acronym> unless there is a good reason
	  for doing so, such as
	  a critical update.  The upgrade process
	  <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, causing permanent damage to the
	  <acronym>BIOS</acronym> chip.</para>
	</note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using &windows; Filesystems</title>

      <para>At this time, &os; does not support file systems compressed with
	the <application>Double Space&trade;</application> application.
	Therefore the file system will need to be uncompressed before &os; can
	access the data.  This
	can be done by running the <application>Compression Agent</application>
	located in the
	<guimenuitem>Start</guimenuitem>&gt; <guimenuitem>Programs</guimenuitem> &gt;
	<guimenuitem>System Tools</guimenuitem> menu.</para>

      <para>&os; can support &ms-dos; file systems (sometimes called
	FAT file systems).  The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; command grafts such file
	systems onto the existing directory hierarchy, allowing the file
	system's contents to be accessed.  The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; program
	is not usually
	invoked directly; instead, it is called by the system through a line
	in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or by using
	&man.mount.8;
	with the appropriate parameters.</para>

      <para>A typical line in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> is:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/ad0sN  /dos  msdosfs rw  0	0</programlisting>

      <note><para><filename class="directory">/dos</filename> must
	  already
	  exist for this to work.  For details about the format of
	  <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, see &man.fstab.5;.</para></note>

      <para>A typical call to &man.mount.8; for a FAT filesystem
	looks like:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/ad0s1 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>In this example, the FAT filesystem is located on the
	first
	partition of the primary hard disk.  The
	output from &man.dmesg.8; and
	&man.mount.8; should produce enough
	information to give an idea of the partition layout.</para>

      <note><para>&os; may number FAT partitions
	  differently than other operating systems.  In particular, extended
	  partitions are usually given higher slice numbers than
	  primary partitions.  Use &man.fdisk.8; to help
	  determine which slices belong to &os; and which belong to other
	  operating systems.</para></note>

      <para>NTFS partitions can also be mounted in a similar manner
	using &man.mount.ntfs.8;.</para>

      <qandaset>
	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>My system hangs while probing hardware during boot
	      or it behaves strangely during install.</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>&os; makes extensive use of the system
	      ACPI service on the i386, amd64, and ia64 platforms to
	      aid in system configuration if it is detected during
	      boot.  Unfortunately, some bugs still exist in the
	      ACPI driver and various system motherboards.
	      The use of ACPI can be disabled by setting
	      <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled</literal> in the
	      third stage boot loader:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</userinput></screen>

	    <para>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it
	      is necessary to
	      add <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</literal> to
	      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> to make this
	      change permanent. More
	      information about the boot loader can be found
	      in <xref linkend="boot-synopsis"/>.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>When booting from the hard disk for the first time
	      after installing &os;, the kernel loads and probes
	      hardware, but stops with messages like:</para>

	    <screen>changing root device to ad1s1a panic: cannot mount root</screen>

	    <para>What is wrong?</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>This can occur when
	      the boot disk is not the first disk in the system.  The
	      BIOS uses a different numbering scheme to &os;, and
	      working out which numbers correspond to which is
	      difficult to get right.</para>

	    <para>If this occurs,
	      tell &os; where the root
	      filesystem is by specifying the BIOS disk
	      number, the disk type, and the &os; disk number for that
	      type.</para>

	    <para>Consider two IDE disks,
	      each configured as the master on their respective IDE
	      bus, where &os; should be booted from the second disk.
	      The
	      BIOS sees these as disk 0 and disk 1, while &os; sees
	      them as <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	      <devicename>ad2</devicename>.</para>

	    <para>If &os; is on BIOS disk 1, of type
	      <literal>ad</literal> and the &os; disk number is 2,
	      this is the correct value:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>1:ad(2,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Note that if there is a slave on the primary bus,
	      the above is not necessary and is effectively
	      wrong.</para>

	    <para>The second situation involves booting from a SCSI
	      disk when there are one or more IDE disks in the system.
	      In this case, the &os; disk number is lower than the
	      BIOS disk number.  For two IDE disks and a
	      SCSI disk, where the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2,
	      type <literal>da</literal>, and &os; disk number 0, the
	      correct value is:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>2:da(0,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>This tells &os; to boot from BIOS disk 2,
	      which is the first SCSI disk in the system.  If there
	      is only IDE disk, use <literal>1:</literal>
	      instead.</para>

	    <para>Once the correct value to use is determined,
	      put the command
	      in <filename>/boot.config</filename> using a
	      text editor.  Unless instructed otherwise, &os;
	      will use the contents of this file as the default
	      response to the <literal>boot:</literal> prompt.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>When booting from the hard disk for the first time
	      after installing &os;, the Boot Manager prompt just
	      prints <literal>F?</literal> at the boot menu and
	      the boot will not go any further.</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>The hard disk geometry was set incorrectly in the
	      partition editor when &os; was installed.  Go back into
	      the partition editor and specify the actual geometry of
	      the hard disk.  &os; must be reinstalled again from the
	      beginning with the correct geometry.</para>

	      <para>For a dedicated &os; system that does not need
		future compatibility with another operating system,
		use the entire disk by selecting
		<guimenuitem>A</guimenuitem> in the installer's
		partition editor.</para>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>The system finds the &man.ed.4; network card but
	      continuously displays device timeout errors.</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>The card is probably on a different IRQ from what
	      is specified in
	      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.  The
	      &man.ed.4; driver does not use software
	      configuration by default,
	      but it will if
	      <literal>-1</literal> is specified in the hints for the
	      interface.</para>

	    <para>Either move the jumper on the card to the
	      configuration setting or specify the IRQ as
	      <literal>-1</literal>
	      by setting the hint <literal>hint.ed.0.irq="-1"</literal>.
	      This tells the kernel to use the software
	      configuration.</para>

	    <para>Another possibility is that the card is at IRQ 9,
	      which is shared by IRQ 2 and frequently a cause of
	      problems, especially if a VGA card is using IRQ
	      2.  Do not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at all
	      possible.</para>

	<para>To prepare for an installation from a &windows;

	<screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>md c:\freebsd</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>robocopy e:\bin c:\freebsd\bin\ /s</userinput>

	</indexterm>
	<para>There are three types of network installations
	  available:
	  Ethernet, PPP, and
	  PLIP.</para>

	<para>For the fastest possible network installation, use an
	  Ethernet adapter.  &os; supports most
	  common Ethernet cards.  A list of supported cards
	  is provided in the Hardware Notes for each
	  release of &os;.  If using a supported PCMCIA
	  Ethernet card, be sure that it is plugged in
	  <emphasis>before</emphasis> the system is powered on as 
	  &os; does
	  not support hot insertion of PCMCIA cards
	  during installation.</para>

	<para>Make note of the system's IP address,
	  subnet mask, hostname, default gateway address, and DNS
	  server addresses if these values are statically assigned.
	  If installing by FTP through a
	  HTTP proxy, make note of the proxy's address.
	  If you do not know these values, ask the system
	  administrator
	  or ISP <emphasis>before</emphasis> trying this type of
	  installation.</para>

	<para>If using a dialup modem, have the service
	  provider's PPP information handy as it is needed
	  early in the installation process.</para>

	<para>If PAP or CHAP are used to connect to the
	  <acronym>ISP</acronym> without using a script,
	  type <command>dial</command> at the &os;
	  <application>ppp</application> prompt.  Otherwise,
	  know how to dial the <acronym>ISP</acronym> using the
	  <quote>AT commands</quote>
	  specific to the modem, as the PPP dialer provides only a
	  simple terminal emulator.  Refer to <xref
	  linkend="userppp"/> and <ulink
	    url="&url.books.faq;/ppp.html"></ulink>
	  for further information.
	  Logging can be directed to the screen using
	  <command>set log local ...</command>.</para>

	<para>If a hard-wired connection to another &os;
	  machine is available, the installation can occur
	  over a null-modem parallel port cable.  The data rate
	  over the parallel port is higher than what is typically
	  possible over a serial line.</para>

	  <para>To perform an <acronym>NFS</acronym> installation,

	    <acronym>NFS</acronym> server
	    and then point the installer's <acronym>NFS</acronym>
	    media selection to it.</para>

	  <para>If the server supports only a <quote>privileged
	      port</quote>,
	    set the option <literal>NFS Secure</literal> in the
	    <guimenu>Options</guimenu> menu so that the installation
	    can
	    proceed.</para>

	  <para>If using a poor quality Ethernet card which suffers
	    from slow transfer rates, toggle the
	    <literal>NFS Slow</literal> flag to on.</para>

	  <para>In order for an <acronym>NFS</acronym> installation to
	    work, the server must
	    support subdir mounts.  For example, if the
	    &os;&nbsp;&rel.current; distribution lives on:
	    <filename
	      class="directory">ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>,
	    <hostid>ziggy</hostid> will have to allow the direct mounting
	    of <filename
	      class="directory">/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>,
	    not just
	    <filename class="directory">/usr</filename> or
	    <filename
	      class="directory">/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>

	  <para>In &os;, this
	    is controlled by using <option>-alldirs</option> in
	    <filename>/etc/exports</filename>.  Other
	    <acronym>NFS</acronym>
	    servers may have different conventions.  If the server is
	    displaying
	    <errorname>permission denied</errorname> messages,
	    it is likely that this is not enabled
	    properly.</para>

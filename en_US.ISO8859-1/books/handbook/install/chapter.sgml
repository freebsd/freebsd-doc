  <title>Installing FreeBSD</title>

    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <indexterm><primary>installation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>FreeBSD is provided with a text-based, easy to use installation
      program called <application>sysinstall</application>.  This is the
      default installation program for FreeBSD, although vendors are free to
      provide their own installation suite if they wish.  This chapter
      describes how to use <application>sysinstall</application> to install
      FreeBSD.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

    <para>Before reading this chapter, you should:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Read the supported hardware list that shipped with the version
	  of FreeBSD you are installing, and verify that your hardware is
	  supported.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>In general, these installation instructions are written
        for &i386; (<quote>PC compatible</quote>) architecture
        computers.  Where applicable, instructions specific to other
        platforms will be listed.  Although this
	guide is kept as up to date as possible, you may find minor
	differences between the installer and what is shown here.  It is
	suggested that you use this chapter as a general guide rather 
	than a literal installation manual.</para>

    <title>Hardware Requirements</title>

    <sect2 id="install-hardware-minimal">
      <title>Minimal Configuration</title>

      <para>The minimal configuration to install &os; varies with the
	&os; version and the hardware architecture.</para>

      <para>A summary of this information is given in the following sections.
	Depending on the method you choose to install &os;, you may
	also need a floppy drive, a supported CDROM drive, and in some
	case a network adapter.  This will be covered by the <xref
	linkend="install-boot-media">.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.i386; and &os;/&arch.pc98;</title>

	<para>Both &os;/&arch.i386; and &os;/&arch.pc98; require a 486 or
	  better processor and at least 24&nbsp;MB of RAM.  You will
	  need at least 150&nbsp;MB of free hard drive space for the
	  most minimal installation.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In case of old configurations, most of time, getting
	    more RAM and more hard drive space is more important than
	    getting a faster processor.</para>
	</note>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.amd64;</title>

	<para>There are two classes of processors capable of running
	  &os;/&arch.amd64;.  The first are AMD64 processors,
	  including the &amd.athlon;64,
	  &amd.athlon;64-FX, &amd.opteron; or better
	  processors.</para>

	<para>The second class of processors that can use
	  &os;/&arch.amd64; includes those using the &intel; EM64T
	  architecture.  Examples of these processors include the
	  &intel;&nbsp;&core;&nbsp;2 Duo, Quad, and Extreme processor
	  families and the &intel;&nbsp;&xeon; 3000, 5000, and 7000
	  sequences of processors.</para>

	<para>If you have a machine based on an nVidia nForce3
	  Pro-150, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the BIOS setup to
	  disable the IO APIC.  If you do not have an option to do
	  this, you will likely have to disable ACPI instead.  There
	  are bugs in the Pro-150 chipset that we have not found a
	  workaround for yet.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>&os;/&arch.sparc64;</title>

	<para>To install &os;/&arch.sparc64;, you will need a supported
	  platform (see <xref
	  linkend="install-hardware-supported">).</para>

	<para>You will need a dedicated disk for &os;/&arch.sparc64;.  It
	  is not possible to share a disk with another operating
	  system at this time.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-hardware-supported">
      <title>Supported Hardware</title>

      <para>A list of supported hardware is provided with each &os;
	release in the &os; Hardware Notes.  This document can usually
	be found in a file named <filename>HARDWARE.TXT</filename>, in
	the top-level directory of a CDROM or FTP distribution or in
	<application>sysinstall</application>'s documentation menu.
	It lists, for a given architecture, what hardware devices are
	known to be supported by each release of &os;.  Copies of the
	supported hardware list for various releases and architectures
	can also be found on the <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Release
	Information</ulink> page of the &os; Web site.</para>

    <sect2 id="install-inventory">
      <title>Inventory Your Computer</title>

      <para>Before installing FreeBSD you should attempt to inventory the
	components in your computer.  The FreeBSD installation routines will
	show you the components (hard disks, network cards, CDROM drives, and
	so forth) with their model number and manufacturer.  FreeBSD will also
	attempt to determine the correct configuration for these devices,
	which includes information about IRQ and IO port usage.  Due to the
	vagaries of PC hardware this process is not always completely
	successful, and you may need to correct FreeBSD's determination of
	your configuration.</para>

      <para>If you already have another operating system installed, such as
	&windows; or Linux, it is a good idea to use the facilities provided
	by those operating systems to see how your hardware is already
	configured.  If you are not sure what settings an expansion
	card is using, you may find it printed on the card itself.  Popular IRQ
	numbers are 3, 5, and 7, and IO port addresses are normally written as
	hexadecimal numbers, such as 0x330.</para>

      <para>We recommend you print or write down this information before
	installing FreeBSD.  It may help to use a table, like this:</para>

      <para>Once the inventory of the components in your computer is

    <sect2>
      <title>Backup Your Data</title>
      
      <para>If the computer you will be installing FreeBSD on contains
	valuable data, then ensure you have it backed up, and that you have
	tested the backups before installing FreeBSD.  The FreeBSD
	installation routine will prompt you before writing any
	data to your disk, but once that process has started it cannot be
	undone.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-where">
      <title>Decide Where to Install FreeBSD</title>

      <para>If you want FreeBSD to use your entire hard disk, then there is nothing
	more to concern yourself with at this point &mdash; you can skip this
	section.</para>

      <para>However, if you need FreeBSD to co-exist with other operating
	systems then you need to have a rough understanding of how data is
	laid out on the disk, and how this affects you.</para>

      <sect3 id="install-where-i386">
	<title>Disk Layouts for &os;/&arch.i386;</title>

      <para>A PC disk can be divided into discrete chunks.  These chunks are
	called <firstterm>partitions</firstterm>. Since
	&os; internally also has partitions, the naming
	can become confusing very quickly, therefore these
	disk chunks are referred to as disk slices or simply slices
	in &os; itself.  For example, the FreeBSD utility
	<command>fdisk</command> which operates on the PC disk partitions,
	refers to slices instead of partitions.  By design, the PC only
	supports four partitions per disk.  These partitions are called
	<firstterm>primary partitions</firstterm>.  To work around this
	limitation and allow more than four partitions, a new partition type
	was created, the <firstterm>extended partition</firstterm>.  A disk
	may contain only one extended partition.  Special partitions, called
	<firstterm>logical partitions</firstterm>, can be created inside this
	extended partition.</para>

      <para>Each partition has a <firstterm>partition ID</firstterm>, which is
	a number used to identify the type of data on the partition.  FreeBSD
	partitions have the partition ID of <literal>165</literal>.</para>

      <para>In general, each operating system that you use will identify
	partitions in a particular way.  For example, DOS, and its
	descendants, like &windows;, assign each primary and logical partition a
	<firstterm>drive letter</firstterm>, starting with
	<devicename>C:</devicename>.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD must be installed into a primary partition.  FreeBSD can
	keep all its data, including any files that you create, on this one
	partition.  However, if you have multiple disks, then you can create a
	FreeBSD partition on all, or some, of them.  When you install FreeBSD,
	you must have one partition available.  This might be a blank
	partition that you have prepared, or it might be an existing partition
	that contains data that you no longer care about.</para>

      <para>If you are already using all the partitions on all your disks, then
	you will have to free one of them for FreeBSD using the tools
	provided by the other operating systems you use (e.g.,
	<command>fdisk</command> on DOS or &windows;).</para>

      <para>If you have a spare partition then you can use that.  However, you
	may need to shrink one or more of your existing partitions
	first.</para>

      <para>A minimal installation of FreeBSD takes as little as 100&nbsp;MB of disk
	space.  However, that is a <emphasis>very</emphasis> minimal install,
	leaving almost no space for your own files.  A more realistic minimum
	is 250&nbsp;MB without a graphical environment, and 350&nbsp;MB or more if you
	want a graphical user interface.  If you intend to install a lot of
	third-party software as well, then you will need more space.</para>

      <para>You can use a commercial tool such as <application>&partitionmagic;</application>, or a free tool such as <application>GParted</application>,
	to resize your partitions and make space for
	&os;.  Both
	<application>&partitionmagic;</application> and
	<application>GParted</application> are known to work on
	<acronym>NTFS</acronym>.  <application>GParted</application>
	is available on a number of Live CD Linux distributions, such as 
	<ulink url="http://www.sysresccd.org/">SystemRescueCD</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Problems have been reported resizing &microsoft; Vista
	partitions.  Having a Vista installation CDROM handy when
	attempting such an operation is recommended.  As with all
	such disk maintenance tasks, a current set of backups is
	also strongly advised.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>Incorrect use of these tools can delete the data on your disk.
	  Be sure that you have recent, working backups before using
	  them.</para>
      </warning>

      <example>
	<title>Using an Existing Partition Unchanged</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk that
	  already has a version of &windows; installed, and you have split the
	  disk into two drive letters, <devicename>C:</devicename> and
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>, each of which is 2&nbsp;GB in size.  You have
	  1&nbsp;GB of data on <devicename>C:</devicename>, and 0.5&nbsp;GB of data on
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>.</para>

	<para>This means that your disk has two partitions on it, one per
	  drive letter.  You can copy all your existing data from
	  <devicename>D:</devicename> to <devicename>C:</devicename>, which
	  will free up the second partition, ready for FreeBSD.</para>
      </example>

      <example>
	<title>Shrinking an Existing Partition</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk that
	  already has a version of &windows; installed.  When you installed
	  &windows; you created one large partition, giving you a
	  <devicename>C:</devicename> drive that is 4&nbsp;GB in size.  You are
	  currently using 1.5&nbsp;GB of space, and want FreeBSD to have 2&nbsp;GB of
	  space.</para>

	<para>In order to install FreeBSD you will need to either:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Backup your &windows; data, and then reinstall &windows;,
	      asking for a 2&nbsp;GB partition at install time.</para>

      <title>Collect Your Network Configuration Details</title>

      <para>If you intend to connect to a network as part of your FreeBSD
	installation (for example, if you will be installing from an FTP
	site or an
	NFS server), then you need to know your network configuration.  You
	will be prompted for this information during the installation so that
	FreeBSD can connect to the network to complete the install.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting to an Ethernet Network or Cable/DSL Modem</title>

	<para>If you connect to an Ethernet network, or you have an Internet
	  connection using an Ethernet adapter via cable or DSL, then you will need the following
	  information:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>

	<para>If you do not know this information, then ask your system
	  administrator or service provider.  They may say that this
	  information is assigned automatically, using
	  <firstterm>DHCP</firstterm>.  If so, make a note of this.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting Using a Modem</title>

	<para>If you dial up to an ISP using a regular modem then you can
	  still install FreeBSD over the Internet, it will just take a very
	  long time.</para>

	<para>You will need to know:</para>

      <title>Check for FreeBSD Errata</title>
      
      <para>Although the FreeBSD project strives to ensure that each release
	of FreeBSD is as stable as possible, bugs do occasionally creep into
	the process.  On very rare occasions those bugs affect the
	installation process.  As these problems are discovered and fixed, they
	are noted in the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/&rel.current;R/errata.html">FreeBSD Errata</ulink>, which is found on the FreeBSD web site.  You
	should check the errata before installing to make sure that there are
	no late-breaking problems which you should be aware of.</para>

      <para>Information about all the releases, including the errata for each
	release, can be found on the 
	<ulink

      <title>Prepare the Boot Media</title>
      
      <para>The FreeBSD installation process is started by booting your
	computer into the FreeBSD installer&mdash;it is not a program you run
	within another operating system.  Your computer normally boots using
	the operating system installed on your hard disk, but it can also be
	configured to use a <quote>bootable</quote> floppy disk.
	Most modern computers can also
	boot from a CDROM in the CDROM drive or from a USB disk.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>If you have FreeBSD on CDROM or DVD (either one you purchased

	  FreeBSD CDROM and DVD images are bootable and can be used to install
	  FreeBSD without any other special preparation.</para>

	    Replace <replaceable>arch</replaceable> and
	    <replaceable>version</replaceable> with the
	    architecture and the version number which you want to

	  <para>The memory stick image has a <filename>.img</filename>
	    extension.  The <filename

      <para>To create boot floppy images, follow these steps:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Acquire the Boot Floppy Images</title>
	  
	  <important>
	    <para>Please note, as of &os;&nbsp;8.<replaceable>X</replaceable>, floppy disk images are
	      no longer available.  Please see above for instructions
	      on how to install &os; using a USB memory stick or just
	      use a CDROM or a DVD.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>The boot disks are available on your installation media
	    in the <filename>floppies/</filename> directory, and
	    can also be downloaded from the floppies directory, <literal>ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/<replaceable>version</replaceable>-RELEASE/floppies/</literal>.
	    Replace <replaceable>arch</replaceable> and
	    <replaceable>version</replaceable>
	    with the architecture and the version number
	    which you want to install, respectively.
	    For example, the boot floppy images for
	    &os;/&arch.i386;&nbsp;&rel2.current;-RELEASE are available
	    from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel2.current;-RELEASE/floppies/"></ulink>.</para>

	  <para>The floppy images have a <filename>.flp</filename> extension.
	    The <filename>floppies/</filename> directory contains a number of
	    different images, and the ones you will need to use depends on the
	    version of FreeBSD you are installing, and in some cases, the
	    hardware you are installing to.
	    In most cases you will need four
	    floppies, <filename>boot.flp</filename>,
	    <filename>kern1.flp</filename>,
	    <filename>kern2.flp</filename>, and
	    <filename>kern3.flp</filename>.  Check
	    <filename>README.TXT</filename> in the same directory for the
	    most up to date information about these floppy images.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>Your FTP program must use <emphasis>binary mode</emphasis>
	      to download these disk images.  Some web browsers have been
	      known to use <emphasis>text</emphasis> (or
	      <emphasis>ASCII</emphasis>) mode, which will be apparent if you
	      cannot boot from the disks.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Prepare the Floppy Disks</title>
	  
	  <para>You must prepare one floppy disk per image file you had to
	    download.  It is imperative that these disks are free from
	    defects.  The easiest way to test this is to format the disks
	    for yourself.  Do not trust pre-formatted floppies.  The format
	    utility in &windows; will not tell about the presence of
	    bad blocks, it simply marks them as <quote>bad</quote>
	    and ignores them.  It is advised that you use brand new
	    floppies if choosing this installation route.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>If you try to install FreeBSD and the installation
	      program crashes, freezes, or otherwise misbehaves, one of
	      the first things to suspect is the floppies.  Try writing
	      the floppy image files to new disks and try
	      again.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Write the Image Files to the Floppy Disks</title>

	  <para>The <filename>.flp</filename> files are
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> regular files you copy to the disk.
	    They are images of the complete contents of the
	    disk.  This means that you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> simply
	    copy files from one disk to another.
	    Instead, you must use specific tools to write the
	    images directly to the disk.</para>

	  <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>If you are creating the floppies on a computer running
      &ms-dos;/&windows;, then we provide a tool to do
      this called <command>fdimage</command>.</para>

	  <para>If you are using the floppies from the CDROM, and your
	    CDROM is the <devicename>E:</devicename> drive, then you would 
	    run this:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>E:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tools\fdimage floppies\boot.flp A:</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Repeat this command for each <filename>.flp</filename>
	    file, replacing the floppy disk each time, being sure to label
	    the disks with the name of the file that you copied to them.
	    Adjust the command line as necessary, depending on where you have
	    placed the <filename>.flp</filename> files.  If you do not have
	    the CDROM, then <command>fdimage</command> can be downloaded from
	    the <ulink
	    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools/"><filename class="directory">tools</filename>
	    directory</ulink> on the FreeBSD FTP site.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you are writing the floppies on a &unix; system (such as
	    another FreeBSD system) you can use the &man.dd.1; command to
	    write the image files directly to disk.  On FreeBSD, you would
	    run:</para>
	  
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=boot.flp of=/dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>On FreeBSD, <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> refers to the
	    first floppy disk (the <devicename>A:</devicename> drive).
	    <filename>/dev/fd1</filename> would be the
	    <devicename>B:</devicename> drive, and so on.  Other &unix;
	    variants might have different names for the floppy disk
	    devices, and you will need to check the documentation for the
	    system as necessary.</para>

      <title>BIOS Drive Numbering</title>

      <para>Before you install and configure FreeBSD on your system, there is an
	important subject that you should be aware of, especially if you have
	multiple hard drives.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Microsoft Windows</primary></indexterm>
      <para>In a PC running a BIOS-dependent operating system such as
	&ms-dos; or &microsoft.windows;, the BIOS is able to abstract the
	normal disk drive order, and
	the operating system goes along with the change.  This allows the user
	to boot from a disk drive other than the so-called <quote>primary
	  master</quote>.  This is especially convenient for some users who have
	found that the simplest and cheapest way to keep a system backup is to
	buy an identical second hard drive, and perform routine copies of the
	first drive to the second drive using 
	<application><trademark class="registered">Ghost</trademark></application> or <application>XCOPY</application>
	.  Then, if the
	first drive fails, or is attacked by a virus, or is scribbled upon by an
	operating system defect, he can easily recover by instructing the BIOS
	to logically swap the drives.  It is like switching the cables on the
	drives, but without having to open the case.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>SCSI</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>BIOS</primary></indexterm>
      <para>More expensive systems with SCSI controllers often include BIOS
	extensions which allow the SCSI drives to be re-ordered in a similar
	fashion for up to seven drives.</para>

      <para>A user who is accustomed to taking advantage of these features may
	become surprised when the results with FreeBSD are not as expected.
	FreeBSD does not use the BIOS, and does not know the <quote>logical BIOS
	  drive mapping</quote>.  This can lead to very perplexing situations,
	especially when drives are physically identical in geometry, and have
	also been made as data clones of one another.</para>

      <para>When using FreeBSD, always restore the BIOS to natural drive
	numbering before installing FreeBSD, and then leave it that way.  If you
	need to switch drives around, then do so, but do it the hard way, and
	open the case and move the jumpers and cables.</para>

	<title>An Illustration from the Files of Bill and Fred's Exceptional
	  Adventures:</title>
      
	<para>Bill breaks-down an older Wintel box to make another FreeBSD box
	  for Fred.  Bill installs a single SCSI drive as SCSI unit zero and
	  installs FreeBSD on it.</para>

	<para>Fred begins using the system, but after several days notices that
	  the older SCSI drive is reporting numerous soft errors and reports
	  this fact to Bill.</para>

	<para>After several more days, Bill decides it is time to address the
	  situation, so he grabs an identical SCSI drive from the disk drive
	  <quote>archive</quote> in the back room.  An initial surface scan
	  indicates that
	  this drive is functioning well, so Bill installs this drive as SCSI
	  unit four and makes an image copy from drive zero to drive four.  Now
	  that the new drive is installed and functioning nicely, Bill decides
	  that it is a good idea to start using it, so he uses features in the
	  SCSI BIOS to re-order the disk drives so that the system boots from
	  SCSI unit four.  FreeBSD boots and runs just fine.</para>

	<para>Fred continues his work for several days, and soon Bill and Fred
	  decide that it is time for a new adventure &mdash; time to upgrade to a
	  newer version of FreeBSD.  Bill removes SCSI unit zero because it was
	  a bit flaky and replaces it with another identical disk drive from
	  the <quote>archive</quote>.  Bill then installs the new version of
	  FreeBSD onto the new SCSI unit zero using Fred's magic Internet FTP
	  floppies.  The installation goes well.</para>

	<para>Fred uses the new version of FreeBSD for a few days, and certifies
	  that it is good enough for use in the engineering department.  It is
	  time to copy all of his work from the old version.  So Fred mounts
	  SCSI unit four (the latest copy of the older FreeBSD version).  Fred
	  is dismayed to find that none of his precious work is present on SCSI
	  unit four.</para>

	<para>Where did the data go?</para>

	<para>When Bill made an image copy of the original SCSI unit zero onto
	  SCSI unit four, unit four became the <quote>new clone</quote>.
	  When Bill re-ordered the SCSI BIOS so that he could boot from
	  SCSI unit four, he was only fooling himself.
	  FreeBSD was still running on SCSI unit zero.
	  Making this kind of BIOS change will cause some or all of the Boot and
	  Loader code to be fetched from the selected BIOS drive, but when the
	  FreeBSD kernel drivers take-over, the BIOS drive numbering will be
	  ignored, and FreeBSD will transition back to normal drive numbering.
	  In the illustration at hand, the system continued to operate on the
	  original SCSI unit zero, and all of Fred's data was there, not on SCSI
	  unit four.  The fact that the system appeared to be running on SCSI
	  unit four was simply an artifact of human expectations.</para>

	<para>We are delighted to mention that no data bytes were killed or
	  harmed in any way by our discovery of this phenomenon.  The older SCSI
	  unit zero was retrieved from the bone pile, and all of Fred's work was
	  returned to him, (and now Bill knows that he can count as high as
	  zero).</para>

	<para>Although SCSI drives were used in this illustration, the concepts
	  apply equally to IDE drives.</para>

      <para>Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> as instructed.  You will then be

	carried out the device probes.  
	<xref linkend="sysinstall-fdisk-drive1"> shows an example from a
	system with two IDE disks.  They have been called
	<devicename>ad0</devicename> and <devicename>ad2</devicename>.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>You might be wondering why <devicename>ad1</devicename> is not
	listed here.  Why has it been missed?</para>

      <para>Consider what would happen if you had two IDE hard disks, one
	as the master on the first IDE controller, and one as the master on
	the second IDE controller.  If FreeBSD numbered these as it found
	them, as <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad1</devicename> then everything would work.</para>

      <para>But if you then added a third disk, as the slave device on the
	first IDE controller, it would now be <devicename>ad1</devicename>,
	and the previous <devicename>ad1</devicename> would become
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>.  Because device names (such as
	<devicename>ad1s1a</devicename>) are used to find filesystems, you
	may suddenly discover that some of your filesystems no longer
	appear correctly, and you would need to change your FreeBSD
	configuration.</para>
      
      <para>To work around this, the kernel can be configured to name IDE
	disks based on where they are, and not the order in which they were
	found.  With this scheme the master disk on the second IDE
	controller will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>, even if there are no
	<devicename>ad0</devicename> or <devicename>ad1</devicename>
	devices.</para>

      <para>This configuration is the default for the FreeBSD kernel, which
	is why this display shows <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>.  The machine on which this screenshot
	was taken had IDE disks on both master channels of the IDE
	controllers, and no disks on the slave channels.</para>

      <para>You should select the disk on which you want to install FreeBSD,
	and then press &gui.ok;.
	<application>FDisk</application> will start, with a display similar to
	that shown in <xref linkend="sysinstall-fdisk1">.</para>

      <para>The <application>FDisk</application> display is broken into three

      <para>The first section, covering the first two lines of the display,
	shows details about the currently selected disk, including its FreeBSD
	name, the disk geometry, and the total size of the disk.</para>

      <para>The second section shows the slices that are currently on the
	disk, where they start and end, how large they are, the name FreeBSD
	gives them, and their description and sub-type.  This example shows two
	small unused slices, which are artifacts of disk layout schemes on the
	PC.  It also shows one large <acronym>FAT</acronym> slice, which almost certainly appears
	as <devicename>C:</devicename> in &ms-dos; / &windows;, and an extended
	slice, which may contain other drive letters for &ms-dos; / &windows;.</para>

      <para>The third section shows the commands that are available in

	The existing slices will be removed, and replaced with a small area
	flagged as <literal>unused</literal> (again, an artifact of PC disk
	layout), and then one large slice for FreeBSD.  If you do this, then
	you should select the newly created FreeBSD slice using the arrow
	keys, and press <keycap>S</keycap> to mark the slice as being
	bootable.  The screen will then look very similar to 
	<xref linkend="sysinstall-fdisk2">.  Note the
	<literal>A</literal> in the <literal>Flags</literal> column, which
	indicates that this slice is <emphasis>active</emphasis>, and will be

      <para>If you will be deleting an existing slice to make space for
	FreeBSD then you should select the slice using the arrow keys, and
	then press <keycap>D</keycap>.  You can then press <keycap>C</keycap>,
	and be prompted for size of slice you want to create.  Enter the
	appropriate figure and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  The default
        value in this box represents the largest possible slice you can
	make, which could be the largest contiguous block of unallocated
	space or the size of the entire hard disk.</para>
      
      <para>If you have already made space for FreeBSD (perhaps by using a

<screen>                         User Confirmation Requested
 Would you like to install the FreeBSD ports collection? 

 This will give you ready access to over &os.numports; ported software packages,
 at a cost of around &ports.size; of disk space when "clean" and possibly much
 more than that if a lot of the distribution tarballs are loaded
 (unless you have the extra CDs from a FreeBSD CD/DVD distribution
 available and can mount it on /cdrom, in which case this is far less
 of a problem). 

 The Ports Collection is a very valuable resource and well worth having
 on your /usr partition, so it is advisable to say Yes to this option.

	    <para>This option will make all FTP transfers 
	      use <quote>Active</quote>
	      mode.  This will not work through firewalls, but will
	      often work with older FTP servers that do not support
	      passive mode.  If your connection hangs with passive
	      mode (the default), try active!</para>

	    <para>This option instructs <application>sysinstall</application> to use 
	      <quote>Passive</quote> mode for all FTP operations.  
	      This allows the user to pass through firewalls
	      that do not allow incoming connections on random TCP ports.

	      <primary>FTP</primary>
	      <secondary>via a HTTP proxy</secondary>

	    <para>This option instructs <application>sysinstall</application> to use the HTTP
	      protocol (like a web browser) to connect to a proxy
	      for all FTP operations.  The proxy will translate
	      the requests and send them to the FTP server.
	      This allows the user to pass through firewalls
	      that do not allow FTP at all, but offer a HTTP
	      proxy.
	      In this case, you have to specify the proxy in
	      addition to the FTP server.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>For a proxy FTP server, you should usually give the name of the
	server you really want as a part of the username, after an
	<quote>@</quote> sign.  The proxy server then <quote>fakes</quote>
	the real server.  For example, assuming you want to install from
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, using the proxy FTP
	server <hostid role="fqdn">foo.example.com</hostid>, listening on port
	1234.</para>
      
      <para>In this case, you go to the options menu, set the FTP username
	to <literal>ftp@ftp.FreeBSD.org</literal>, and the password to your
	email address.  As your installation media, you specify FTP (or
	passive FTP, if the proxy supports it), and the URL
	<literal>ftp://foo.example.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD</literal>.</para>

      <para>Since <filename>/pub/FreeBSD</filename> from 
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> is proxied under 
	<hostid role="fqdn">foo.example.com</hostid>, you are able to install
	from <emphasis>that</emphasis> machine (which will fetch the files

 Anonymous FTP permits un-authenticated users to connect to the system
 FTP server, if FTP service is enabled.  Anonymous users are
 restricted to a specific subset of the file system, and the default
 configuration provides a drop-box incoming directory to which uploads
 are permitted.  You must separately enable both inetd(8), and enable
 ftpd(8) in inetd.conf(5) for FTP services to be available.  If you
 did not do so earlier, you will have the opportunity to enable inetd(8)
 again later.

 If you want the server to be read-only you should leave the upload
 directory option empty and add the -r command-line option to ftpd(8)
 in inetd.conf(5)

      <title>Configure Additional Network Services</title>

      <para>Configuring network services can be a daunting
	task for new users if they lack previous
	knowledge in this area.  Networking, including the Internet,
	is critical to all modern operating systems including &os;;
	as a result, it is very useful to have some understanding
	&os;'s extensive networking capabilities.  Doing this
	during the installation will ensure users have some
	understanding of the various services available to them.</para>

      <para>Network services are programs that accept input from
	anywhere on the network.  Every effort is made to make sure
	these programs will not do anything <quote>harmful</quote>.
	Unfortunately, programmers are not perfect and through time
	there have been cases where bugs in network services have been
	exploited by attackers to do bad things.  It is important that
	you only enable the network services you know that you need.  If
	in doubt it is best if you do not enable a network service until
	you find out that you do need it.  You can always enable it
	later by re-running <application>sysinstall</application> or by
	using the features provided by the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenu>Networking</guimenu> option will display
	a menu similar to the one below:</para>

      <figure id="network-configuration">

      <para>The first option, <guimenuitem>Interfaces</guimenuitem>, was previously covered during
	the <xref linkend="inst-network-dev">, thus this option can
	safely be ignored.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenuitem>AMD</guimenuitem> option adds
	support for the <acronym>BSD</acronym> automatic mount utility.
	This is usually used in conjunction with the
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> protocol (see below)
	for automatically mounting remote file systems.
	No special configuration is required here.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>AMD Flags</guimenuitem>
	option.  When selected, a menu will pop up for you
	to enter specific <acronym>AMD</acronym> flags.
	The menu already contains a set of default options:</para>

      <screen>-a /.amd_mnt -l syslog /host /etc/amd.map /net /etc/amd.map</screen>

      <para>The <option>-a</option> option sets the default mount
	location which is specified here as
	<filename>/.amd_mnt</filename>.  The <option>-l</option>
	option specifies the default <filename>log</filename> file;
	however, when <literal>syslogd</literal> is used all log
	activity will be sent to the system log daemon.  The
	<filename class="directory">/host</filename> directory is used
	to mount an exported file system from a remote
	host, while <filename class="directory">/net</filename>
	directory is used to mount an exported file system from an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address.  The
	<filename>/etc/amd.map</filename> file defines the default
	options for <acronym>AMD</acronym> exports.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>FTP</primary>
	<secondary>anonymous</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Anon FTP</guimenuitem> option permits anonymous
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> connections.  Select this option to
	make this machine an anonymous <acronym>FTP</acronym> server.
	Be aware of the security risks involved with this option.
	Another menu will be displayed to explain the security risks
	and configuration in depth.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> configuration menu will set
	the machine up to be a gateway as explained previously.  This
	can be used to unset the <guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> option if you accidentally
	selected it during the installation process.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Inetd</guimenuitem> option can be used to configure
	or completely disable the &man.inetd.8; daemon as discussed
	above.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Mail</guimenuitem> option is used to configure the system's
	default <acronym>MTA</acronym> or Mail Transfer Agent.
	Selecting this option will bring up the following menu:</para>

      <figure id="mta-selection">
	<title>Select a default MTA</title>

	    <imagedata fileref="install/mta-main" format="PNG">

	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Here you are offered a choice as to which
	<acronym>MTA</acronym> to install
	and set as the default.  An <acronym>MTA</acronym> is nothing
	more than a mail server which delivers email to users on the
	system or the Internet.</para>

      <para>Selecting <guimenuitem>Sendmail</guimenuitem> will install
	the popular <application>sendmail</application> server which
	is the &os; default.  The <guimenuitem>Sendmail local</guimenuitem> option
	will set <application>sendmail</application> to be the default
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>, but disable its ability to receive
	incoming email from the Internet.  The other options here,
	<guimenuitem>Postfix</guimenuitem> and
	<guimenuitem>Exim</guimenuitem> act similar to
	<guimenuitem>Sendmail</guimenuitem>.  They both deliver
	email; however, some users prefer these alternatives to the
	<application>sendmail</application>
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>.</para>

      <para>After selecting an <acronym>MTA</acronym>, or choosing
	not to select an MTA, the network configuration menu will appear
	with the next option being <guimenuitem>NFS client</guimenuitem>.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>NFS client</guimenuitem> option will
	configure the system to communicate with a server via
	<acronym>NFS</acronym>.  An <acronym>NFS</acronym> server
	makes file systems available to other machines on the
	network via the <acronym>NFS</acronym> protocol.  If this is
	a stand-alone machine, this option can remain unselected.
	The system may require more configuration later; see
	<xref linkend="network-nfs"> for more
	information about client and server configuration.</para>

      <para>Below that option is the <guimenuitem>NFS server</guimenuitem>
	option, permitting you to set the system up as an
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> server.  This adds the required
	information to start up the <acronym>RPC</acronym> remote
	procedure call services.  <acronym>RPC</acronym> is used to
	coordinate connections between hosts and programs.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>Ntpdate</guimenuitem> option,
	which deals with time synchronization.  When selected, a menu

      <para>From this menu, select the server which is the closest
	to your location.  Selecting a close one will make the time
	synchronization more accurate as a server further from your
	location may have more connection latency.</para>

      <para>The next option is the <acronym>PCNFSD</acronym> selection.
	This option will install the
	<filename role="package">net/pcnfsd</filename> package from
	the Ports Collection.  This is a useful utility which provides
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> authentication services for systems which
	are unable to provide their own, such as Microsoft's
	&ms-dos; operating system.</para>

      <para>Now you must scroll down a bit to see the other

      <para>The &man.rpcbind.8;, &man.rpc.statd.8;, and
	&man.rpc.lockd.8; utilities are all used for Remote Procedure
	Calls (<acronym>RPC</acronym>).
	The <command>rpcbind</command> utility manages communication
	between <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients, and is
	required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers to operate
	correctly.  The <application>rpc.statd</application> daemon interacts
	with the <application>rpc.statd</application> daemon on other hosts to
	provide status monitoring.  The reported status is usually held
	in the <filename>/var/db/statd.status</filename> file.  The
	next option listed here is the <guimenuitem>rpc.lockd</guimenuitem>
	option, which, when selected, will provide file locking
	services.  This is usually used with
	<application>rpc.statd</application> to monitor what hosts are
	requesting locks and how frequently they request them.
	While these last two options are marvelous for debugging, they
	are not required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients
	to operate correctly.</para>

      <para>As you progress down the list the next item here is
	<guimenuitem>Routed</guimenuitem>, which is the routing daemon.  The
	&man.routed.8; utility manages network routing tables,
	discovers multicast routers, and supplies a copy of the routing
	tables to any physically connected host on the network upon
	request.  This is mainly used for machines which act as a
	gateway for the local network.  When selected, a menu will be
	presented requesting the default location of the utility.
	The default location is already defined for you and can be
	selected with the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key.  You will then
	be presented with yet another menu, this time asking for the
	flags you wish to pass on to <application>routed</application>.  The
	default is <option>-q</option> and it should already appear
	on the screen.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>Rwhod</guimenuitem> option which,
	when selected, will start the &man.rwhod.8; daemon
	during system initialization.  The <command>rwhod</command>
	utility broadcasts system messages across the network
	periodically, or collects them when in <quote>consumer</quote>
	mode.  More information can be found in the &man.ruptime.1; and
	&man.rwho.1; manual pages.</para>

      <para>The next to the last option in the list is for the
	&man.sshd.8; daemon.  This is the secure shell server for
	<application>OpenSSH</application> and it is highly recommended
	over the standard <application>telnet</application> and
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> servers.  The <application>sshd</application>
	server is used to create a secure connection from one host to
	another by using encrypted connections.</para>

      <para>Finally there is the <guimenuitem>TCP Extensions</guimenuitem>
	option.  This enables the <acronym>TCP</acronym> Extensions
	defined in <acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1323 and
	<acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1644.  While on many hosts this can
	speed up connections, it can also cause some connections to be
	dropped.  It is not recommended for servers, but may be
	beneficial for stand alone machines.</para>

      <para>Now that you have configured the network services, you can
	scroll up to the very top item which is <guimenuitem>X Exit</guimenuitem>
	and continue on to the next configuration item or simply exit
	<application>sysinstall</application> in selecting
	<guimenuitem>X Exit</guimenuitem> twice then <guibutton>[X
	Exit Install]</guibutton>.</para>

      <title>What to Do If Something Goes Wrong</title>

      <para>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is
        impossible for probing to be 100% reliable, however, there are a
        few things you can do if it fails.</para>

      <para>Check the <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Hardware Notes
	</ulink> document for your version of &os; to make sure your
	hardware is supported.</para>

      <para>If your hardware is supported and you still experience
        lock-ups or other problems, you will need to build a <link
	linkend="kernelconfig">custom kernel</link>.  This will
        allow you to add in support for devices which are not present in the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  The kernel on the boot disks
	is configured assuming that most hardware devices are in their
	factory default configuration in terms of IRQs, IO addresses, and
	DMA channels.  If your hardware has been reconfigured, you will most
	likely need to edit the kernel configuration and recompile to tell
	&os; where to find things.</para>

      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present will
        cause a later probe for another device that is present to fail.  In
        that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s) should be
        disabled.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Some installation problems can be avoided or alleviated
          by updating the firmware on various hardware components, most notably
          the motherboard.  The motherboard firmware may also be referred to
          as <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and most of the motherboard or computer
          manufactures have a website where the upgrades and upgrade information
          may be located.</para>

        <para>Most manufacturers strongly advise against upgrading the motherboard
          <acronym>BIOS</acronym> unless there is a good reason for doing so, which
          could possibly be a critical update of sorts.  The upgrade process
          <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, causing permanent damage to the
          <acronym>BIOS</acronym> chip.</para>
        </note>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Using &ms-dos; and &windows; File Systems</title>

      <para>At this time, &os; does not support file systems compressed with the
	<application>Double Space&trade;</application> application.  Therefore the file
	system will need to be uncompressed before &os; can access the data.  This
	can be done by running the <application>Compression Agent</application>
	located in the <guimenuitem>Start</guimenuitem>&gt; <guimenuitem>Programs</guimenuitem> &gt;
	<guimenuitem>System Tools</guimenuitem> menu.</para>

      <para>&os; can support &ms-dos; file systems (sometimes called
	FAT file systems).  The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; command grafts such file
	systems onto the existing directory hierarchy, allowing the file
	system's contents to be accessed. The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; program is not usually
	invoked directly; instead, it is called by the system through a line
	in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or by a call to the &man.mount.8;
	utility with the appropriate parameters.</para>

      <para>A typical line in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> is:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/ad0sN  /dos  msdosfs rw  0	0</programlisting>

      <note><para>The <filename>/dos</filename> directory must already
	  exist for this to work.  For details about the format of
	  <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, see &man.fstab.5;.</para></note>

      <para>A typicall call to &man.mount.8; for a &ms-dos; file system
	looks like:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/ad0s1 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>In this example, the &ms-dos; file system is located on the first partition of
	the primary hard disk.  Your situation may be different, check the output from
	the <command>dmesg</command>, and <command>mount</command> commands.  They should
	produce enough information to give an idea of the partition layout.</para>

      <note><para>&os; may number disk slices (that is, &ms-dos; partitions)
	  differently than other operating systems.  In particular, extended
	  &ms-dos; partitions are usually given higher slice numbers than
	  primary &ms-dos; partitions.  The &man.fdisk.8; utility can help
	  determine which slices belong to &os; and which belong to other
	  operating systems.</para></note>

      <para>NTFS partitions can also be mounted in a similar manner
	using the &man.mount.ntfs.8; command.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>My system hangs while probing hardware during boot,
	      or it behaves strangely during install, or the floppy
	      drive is not probed.</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>&os; makes extensive use of the system
	      ACPI service on the i386, amd64 and ia64 platforms to
	      aid in system configuration if it is detected during
	      boot.  Unfortunately, some bugs still exist in both the
	      ACPI driver and within system motherboards and BIOS.
	      The use of ACPI can be disabled by setting
	      the <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled</literal> hint in the
	      third stage boot loader:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</userinput></screen>

	    <para>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it
	      is necessary to
	      add <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</literal> to the
	      file
	      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  More
	      information about the boot loader can be found
	      in <xref linkend="boot-synopsis">.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time
	      after installing &os;, the kernel loads and probes my
	      hardware, but stops with messages like:</para>

	    <screen>changing root device to ad1s1a panic: cannot mount root</screen>

	    <para>What is wrong?  What can I do?</para>

	    <para>What is this
	      <literal>bios_drive:interface(unit,partition)kernel_name</literal>
	      thing that is displayed with the boot help?</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>There is a longstanding problem in the case where
	      the boot disk is not the first disk in the system.  The
	      BIOS uses a different numbering scheme to &os;, and
	      working out which numbers correspond to which is
	      difficult to get right.</para>

	    <para>In the case where the boot disk is not the first
	      disk in the system, &os; can need some help finding it.
	      There are two common situations here, and in both of
	      these cases, you need to tell &os; where the root
	      filesystem is.  You do this by specifying the BIOS disk
	      number, the disk type and the &os; disk number for that
	      type.</para>

	    <para>The first situation is where you have two IDE disks,
	      each configured as the master on their respective IDE
	      busses, and wish to boot &os; from the second disk.  The
	      BIOS sees these as disk 0 and disk 1, while &os; sees
	      them as <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	      <devicename>ad2</devicename>.</para>

	    <para>&os; is on BIOS disk 1, of type
	      <literal>ad</literal> and the &os; disk number is 2, so
	      you would say:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>1:ad(2,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Note that if you have a slave on the primary bus,
	      the above is not necessary (and is effectively
	      wrong).</para>

	    <para>The second situation involves booting from a SCSI
	      disk when you have one or more IDE disks in the system.
	      In this case, the &os; disk number is lower than the
	      BIOS disk number.  If you have two IDE disks as well as
	      the SCSI disk, the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2,
	      type <literal>da</literal> and &os; disk number 0, so
	      you would say:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>2:da(0,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>To tell &os; that you want to boot from BIOS disk 2,
	      which is the first SCSI disk in the system.  If you only
	      had one IDE disk, you would use <literal>1:</literal> instead.</para>

	    <para>Once you have determined the correct values to use,
	      you can put the command exactly as you would have typed
	      it in the <filename>/boot.config</filename> file using a

	  <question>
	    <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time
	      after installing &os;, but the Boot Manager prompt just

	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>The hard disk geometry was set incorrectly in the
	      partition editor when you installed &os;.  Go back into
	      the partition editor and specify the actual geometry of
	      your hard disk.  You must reinstall &os; again from the
	      beginning with the correct geometry.</para>

	    <para>If you are failing entirely in figuring out the
	      correct geometry for your machine, here is a tip: Install
	      a small DOS partition at the beginning of the disk and
	      install &os; after that.  The install program will see
	      the DOS partition and try to infer the correct geometry
	      from it, which usually works.</para>

	    <para>The following tip is no longer recommended, but is
	      left here for reference:</para>

	    <blockquote>
	      <para>If you are setting up a truly dedicated &os;
		server or workstation where you do not care for
		(future) compatibility with DOS, Linux or another
		operating system, you also have got the option to use
		the entire disk (<guimenuitem>A</guimenuitem> in the partition editor),
		selecting the non-standard option where &os; occupies
		the entire disk from the very first to the very last
		sector.  This will leave all geometry considerations
		aside, but is somewhat limiting unless you're never
		going to run anything other than &os; on a
		disk.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>The system finds my &man.ed.4; network card, but I
	      keep getting device timeout errors.</para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>Your card is probably on a different IRQ from what
	      is specified in
	      the <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file.  The
	      &man.ed.4; driver does not use the <quote>soft</quote> configuration by
	      default (values entered using EZSETUP in DOS), but it
	      will use the software configuration if you
	      specify <literal>-1</literal> in the hints for the
	      interface.</para>

	    <para>Either move the jumper on the card to a hard
	      configuration setting (altering the kernel settings if
	      necessary), or specify the IRQ as <literal>-1</literal>
	      by setting the hint <literal>hint.ed.0.irq="-1"</literal>
	      This will tell the kernel to use the soft
	      configuration.</para>

	    <para>Another possibility is that your card is at IRQ 9,
	      which is shared by IRQ 2 and frequently a cause of
	      problems (especially when you have a VGA card using IRQ
	      2!).  You should not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at all
	      possible.</para>

    <para>This section describes how to install FreeBSD in exceptional
       cases.</para>

    <sect2 id="headless-install">
      <title>Installing FreeBSD on a System without a Monitor or
        Keyboard</title>

        <primary>installation</primary>
        <secondary>headless (serial console)</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>serial console</primary></indexterm>
      <para>This type of installation is called a <quote>headless
	install</quote>, because the machine that you are trying to install
	FreeBSD on either does not have a monitor attached to it, or does not
	even have a VGA output.  How is this possible you ask? Using a
        serial console.  A serial console is basically using another
        machine to act as the main display and keyboard for a
        system.  To do this, just follow the steps to create
        an installation USB memstick, explained in <xref
	linkend="install-boot-media"> or download the correct
	installation ISO image see <xref
	linkend="install-cdrom">.</para>


      <para>To modify these media to boot into a serial console, follow
	these steps (If you want to use a CDROM you can skip the first
	step):</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Enabling the Installation USB Stick to Boot into a
	    Serial Console</title>
  	    <indexterm>
	      <primary><command>mount</command></primary>
	    </indexterm>
	    <para>If you were to boot into the USB stick that you just
	      made, FreeBSD would boot into its normal install mode.  We
	      want FreeBSD to boot into a serial console for our
	      install.  To do this, you have to mount the
	      USB disk onto your &os;
	      system using the &man.mount.8; command.</para>

            <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/<replaceable>da0a</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	    <note>
	      <para>Adapt the device node and the mount point to your
		situation.</para>
	    </note>

	    <para>Now that you have the stick mounted, you must set
	      the USB stick to boot into a serial console.  You have
	      to add to the <filename>loader.conf</filename> file of
	      the USB stick file system a line setting the serial
	      console as the system console:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'console="comconsole"' &gt;&gt; <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable>/boot/loader.conf</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now that you have your USB stick configured correctly,
	      you must unmount the disk using the &man.umount.8;
	      command:</para>

            <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>umount <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now you can unplug the USB stick and jump directly
	      to the third step of this procedure.</para>
	  </step>

	<step>
	  <title>Enabling the Installation CD to Boot into a
	    Serial Console</title>
  	    <indexterm>
	      <primary><command>mount</command></primary>
	    </indexterm>
	    <para>If you were to boot into the CD that you just
	      made from the installation ISO image (see <xref
	      linkend="install-cdrom">), &os; would boot into its
	      normal install mode.  We want &os; to boot into a serial
	      console for our install.  To do this, you have to
	      extract, modify and regenerate the ISO image before
	      burning it on a CD-R media.</para>

	    <para>From the &os; system where is saved the installation
	      ISO image, for example
	      <filename>&os;-<replaceable>&rel.current;</replaceable>-RELEASE-<replaceable>i386</replaceable>-disc1.iso</filename>,
	      use the &man.tar.1; utility to extract all the files:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir <replaceable>/path/to/headless-iso</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar -C <replaceable>/path/to/headless-iso</replaceable> -pxvf &os;-<replaceable>&rel.current;</replaceable>-RELEASE-<replaceable>i386</replaceable>-disc1.iso</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now you must set the installation media to boot into a
	      serial console.  You have to add to the
	      <filename>loader.conf</filename> file from the extracted
	      ISO image a line setting the serial console as the
	      system console:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo 'console="comconsole"' &gt;&gt; <replaceable>/path/to/headless-iso</replaceable>/boot/loader.conf</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Then we can create a new ISO image from the modified
	      tree.  The &man.mkisofs.8; tool from the <filename
	      role="package">sysutils/cdrtools</filename> port is
	      used:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkisofs -v -b boot/cdboot -no-emul-boot -r -J -V "<replaceable>Headless_install</replaceable>" \
	    -o <replaceable>Headless-</replaceable>&os;-<replaceable>&rel.current;</replaceable>-RELEASE-<replaceable>i386</replaceable>-disc1.iso <replaceable>/path/to/headless-iso</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now that you have your ISO image configured correctly,
	      you can burn it on a CD-R with your favorite burning
	      application.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Connecting Your Null-modem Cable</title>

  	    <indexterm><primary>null-modem cable</primary></indexterm>
	    <para>You now need to connect a
	      <link linkend="term-cables-null">null-modem cable</link> between
	      the two machines.  Just connect the cable to the serial
	      ports of the 2 machines.  <emphasis>A normal serial cable
	      will not work here</emphasis>, you need a null-modem
	      cable because it has some of the wires inside crossed
	      over.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Booting Up for the Install</title>

	    <para>It is now time to go ahead and start the install.  Plug in
	      the USB memstick on
	      the machine you are doing the headless install
	      on, and power on the machine.  If you are using a
	      prepared CDROM, power on the machine and insert the disk
	      to boot on.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Connecting to Your Headless Machine</title>
	    <indexterm>
	      <primary><command>cu</command></primary>
	    </indexterm>
	    <para>Now you have to connect to that machine with
	      &man.cu.1;:</para> 

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cu -l /dev/cuau0</userinput></screen>

	    <para>On &os;&nbsp;7.<replaceable>X</replaceable> use the following command
	      instead:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cu -l /dev/cuad0</userinput></screen>

	  </step>
      </procedure>

      <para>That's it! You should now be able to control the headless machine
	through your <command>cu</command> session.  It will load the kernel
	and then it will come up
	with a selection of what kind of terminal to use.  Select the
	FreeBSD color console and proceed with your install!</para>

	<para>At a minimum, you will need as many 1.44&nbsp;MB floppies
	  as it takes to hold all the files in the
	  <filename>base</filename> (base distribution) directory.  If
	  you are preparing the floppies from DOS, then they
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> be formatted using the &ms-dos;
	  <command>FORMAT</command> command.  If you are using &windows;,
	  use Explorer to format the disks (right-click on the
	  <devicename>A:</devicename> drive, and select <quote>Format</quote>).</para>

	<para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> trust factory pre-formatted
	  floppies.  Format them again yourself, just to be sure.  Many
	  problems reported by our users in the past have resulted from
	  the use of improperly formatted media, which is why we are
	  making a point of it now.</para>

	<para>If you are creating the floppies on another FreeBSD machine,
	  a format is still not a bad idea, though you do not need to put
	  a DOS filesystem on each floppy.  You can use the
	  <command>bsdlabel</command> and <command>newfs</command>
	  commands to put a UFS filesystem on them instead, as the
	  following sequence of commands (for a 3.5" 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy)
	  illustrates:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdformat -f 1440 fd0.1440</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>bsdlabel -w fd0.1440 floppy3</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -t 2 -u 18 -l 1 -i 65536 /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	<para>Then you can mount and write to them like any other
	  filesystem.</para>

	<para>After you have formatted the floppies, you will need to copy
	  the files to them.  The distribution files are split into chunks
	  conveniently sized so that five of them will fit on a conventional
	  1.44&nbsp;MB floppy.  Go through all your floppies, packing as many
	  files as will fit on each one, until you have all of the
	  distributions you want packed up in this fashion.  Each
	  distribution should go into a subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.:
	  <filename>a:\base\base.aa</filename>,
	  <filename>a:\base\base.ab</filename>, and so on.</para>

	<important>
	  <para>The <filename>base.inf</filename> file also needs to go on the
	    first floppy of the <filename>base</filename> set since it is read
	    by the installation program in order to figure out how many
	    additional pieces to look for when fetching and concatenating the
	    distribution.</para>
	</important>

	<para>Once you come to the Media screen during the install
	  process, select <guimenuitem>Floppy</guimenuitem> and you
	  will be prompted for the rest.</para>

        <title>Installing from an &ms-dos; Partition</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>installation</primary>
	  <secondary>from MS-DOS</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	<para>To prepare for an installation from an &ms-dos; partition,
	  copy the files from the distribution into a directory
          called <filename>freebsd</filename> in the root directory of the
	  partition.  For example, <filename>c:\freebsd</filename>.  The
	  directory structure of the CDROM or FTP site must be partially
	  reproduced within this directory, so we suggest using the DOS
	  <command>xcopy</command> command if you are copying it from a CD.
	  For example, to prepare for a minimal installation of
	  FreeBSD:</para>

	<screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>md c:\freebsd</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>xcopy e:\bin c:\freebsd\bin\ /s</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>xcopy e:\manpages c:\freebsd\manpages\ /s</userinput></screen>

	<para>Assuming that <devicename>C:</devicename> is where you have
	  free space and <devicename>E:</devicename> is where your CDROM
	  is mounted.</para>
	
	<para>If you do not have a CDROM drive, you can download the
	  distribution from <ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">ftp.FreeBSD.org</ulink>.
	  Each distribution is in its own directory; for example, the
	  <emphasis>base</emphasis> distribution can be found in the <ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/base/">&rel.current;/base/</ulink>
	  directory.</para>

	<para>For as many distributions you wish to install from an &ms-dos;
	  partition (and you have the free space for), install each one
	  under <filename>c:\freebsd</filename> &mdash; the
	  <literal>BIN</literal> distribution is the only one required for
	  a minimum installation.</para>

	  <secondary>from QIC/SCSI Tape</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	<para>Installing from tape is probably the easiest method, short
	  of an online FTP install or CDROM install.  The installation
	  program expects the files to be simply tarred onto the tape.
	  After getting all of the distribution files you are interested
	  in, simply tar them onto the tape:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /freebsd/distdir</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar cvf /dev/rwt0 dist1 ... dist2</userinput></screen>

	<para>When you perform the installation, you should make
	  sure that you leave enough room in some temporary directory
	  (which you will be allowed to choose) to accommodate the
	  <emphasis>full</emphasis> contents of the tape you have created.
	  Due to the non-random access nature of tapes, this method of
	  installation requires quite a bit of temporary storage.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>When starting the installation, the tape must be in the
	    drive <emphasis>before</emphasis> booting from the boot
	    floppy.  The installation probe may otherwise fail to find
	    it.</para>

	  <secondary>network</secondary>
	  <tertiary>Ethernet</tertiary>
	</indexterm>
	<para>There are three types of network installations available.
	  Ethernet (a standard Ethernet controller), Serial port (PPP), or
	  Parallel port (PLIP (laplink cable)).</para>

	<para>For the fastest possible network installation, an
	  Ethernet adapter is always a good choice!  FreeBSD supports most
	  common PC Ethernet cards; a table of supported cards (and their
	  required settings) is provided in the Hardware Notes for each
	  release of FreeBSD.  If you are using one of the supported PCMCIA
	  Ethernet cards, also be sure that it is plugged in
	  <emphasis>before</emphasis> the laptop is powered on!  FreeBSD does
	  not, unfortunately, currently support hot insertion of PCMCIA cards
	  during installation.</para>

	<para>You will also need to know your IP address on the network,
	  the netmask value for your address class, and the name of your
	  machine.  If you are installing over a PPP connection and do not
	  have a static IP, fear not, the IP address can be dynamically
	  assigned by your ISP.  Your system administrator can tell you
	  which values to use for your particular network setup.  If you
	  will be referring to other hosts by name rather than IP address,
	  you will also need a name server and possibly the address of a
	  gateway (if you are using PPP, it is your provider's IP address)
	  to use in talking to it.  If you want to install by FTP via a
	  HTTP proxy, you will also need the proxy's address.
	  If you do not know the answers to all or most of these questions,
	  then you should really probably talk to your system administrator
	  or ISP <emphasis>before</emphasis> trying this type of
	  installation.</para>

	<para>If you are using a modem, then PPP is almost certainly
	  your only choice.  Make sure that you have your service
	  provider's information handy as you will need to know it fairly
	  early in the installation process.</para>  

	<para>If you use PAP or CHAP to connect your ISP (in other words, if
	  you can connect to the ISP in &windows; without using a script), then
	  all you will need to do is type in <command>dial</command> at the
	  <application>ppp</application> prompt.  Otherwise, you will need to
	  know how to dial your ISP using the <quote>AT commands</quote>
	  specific to your modem, as the PPP dialer provides only a very
	  simple terminal emulator.  Please refer to the user-ppp <link
	  linkend="userppp">handbook</link> and <ulink
	  url="&url.books.faq;/ppp.html">FAQ</ulink> entries for further information.
	  If you have problems, logging can be directed to the screen using
	  the command <command>set log local ...</command>.</para>

	<para>If a hard-wired connection to another FreeBSD
	  machine is available, you might also consider installing
	  over a <quote>laplink</quote> parallel port cable.  The data rate
	  over the parallel port is much higher than what is typically
	  possible over a serial line (up to 50&nbsp;kbytes/sec), thus resulting
	  in a quicker installation.</para>

	  <title>Before Installing via NFS</title>

	  <indexterm>
	    <primary>installation</primary>
	    <secondary>network</secondary>
	    <tertiary>NFS</tertiary>
	  </indexterm>
	  <para>The NFS installation is fairly straight-forward.  Simply
	    copy the FreeBSD distribution files you want onto an NFS server
	    and then point the NFS media selection at it.</para>

	  <para>If this server supports only <quote>privileged port</quote>
	    (as is generally the default for Sun workstations), you will
	    need to set the option <literal>NFS Secure</literal> in the
	    <guimenu>Options</guimenu> menu before installation can proceed.</para>

	  <para>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which suffers
	    from very slow transfer rates, you may also wish to toggle the
	    <literal>NFS Slow</literal> flag.</para>

	  <para>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must
	    support subdir mounts, for example, if your FreeBSD&nbsp;&rel.current; distribution
	    directory lives on:
	    <filename>ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, then
	    <hostid>ziggy</hostid> will have to allow the direct mounting
	    of <filename>/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, not just
	    <filename>/usr</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>

	  <para>In FreeBSD's <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file, this
	    is controlled by the <option>-alldirs</option> options.  Other NFS
	    servers may have different conventions.  If you are getting
	    <errorname>permission denied</errorname> messages from the
	    server, then it is likely that you do not have this enabled
	    properly.</para>

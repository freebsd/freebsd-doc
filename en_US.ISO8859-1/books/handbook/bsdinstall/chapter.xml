    <indexterm><primary>installation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Beginning with &os;&nbsp;9.0-RELEASE, &os; provides an easy
      to use, text-based installation
      program named <application>bsdinstall</application>.   This
      chapter describes how to install &os; using
      <application>bsdinstall</application>.</para>

    <para>In general, the installation instructions in this chapter
      are written for the &i386; and <acronym>AMD64</acronym>
      architectures.  Where applicable, instructions specific to other
      platforms will be listed.  There may be minor differences
      between the installer and what is shown here, so use this
      chapter as a general guide rather than as a set of literal
      instructions.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Users who prefer to install &os; using a graphical
	installer may be interested in
	<application>pc-sysinstall</application>, the installer used
	by the PC-BSD Project.  It can be used to install either a
	graphical desktop (PC-BSD) or a command line version of &os;.

    <title>Minimum Hardware Requirements</title>

    <para>The hardware requirements to install &os; vary by the
      hardware architecture.  Hardware architectures
      and devices supported by a &os; release are listed on the
      Release Information page of the &os; web site (<link
	xlink:href="&url.base;/releases/index.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html</link>).</para>

    <para>A &os; installation will require a minimum 64&nbsp;MB of
      <acronym>RAM</acronym> and 1.5&nbsp;GB of free hard drive space
      for the most minimal installation.  However, that is a
      <emphasis>minimal</emphasis> install, leaving almost no
      free space.  RAM requirements depend on usage.  Specialized
      FreeBSD systems can run in as little as 128MB RAM while desktop
      systems should have at least 4&nbsp;GB
      of <acronym>RAM</acronym>.</para>

    <para>The processor requirements for each architecture can be
      summarized as follows:</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="bsdinstall-pre">
    <title>Pre-Installation Tasks</title>

    <para>Once it has been determined that the system meets the
      minimum hardware requirements for installing &os;, the
      installation file should be downloaded and the installation
      media prepared.  Before doing this, check that the system is
      ready for an installation by verifying the items in this
      checklist:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<title>Back Up Important Data</title>

	<para>Before installing any operating system,
	  <emphasis>always</emphasis> backup all important data first.
	  Do not store the backup on the system being installed.
	  Instead, save the data to a removable disk such as a
	  <acronym>USB</acronym> drive, another system on the network,
	  or an online backup service.  Test the backup before
	  starting the installation to make sure it contains all of
	  the needed files.  Once the installer formats the system's
	  disk, all data stored on that disk will be lost.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<title>Decide Where to Install &os;</title>

	<para>If &os; will be the only operating system installed,
	  this step can be skipped.  But if &os; will share the disk
	  with another operating system, decide which disk or
	  partition will be used for &os;.</para>

	<para>In the &arch.i386; and &arch.amd64; architectures, disks
	  can be divided into multiple partitions using one of two
	  partitioning schemes.  A traditional <firstterm>Master Boot
	    Record</firstterm> (<acronym>MBR</acronym>) holds a
	  partition table defining up to four <firstterm>primary
	    partitions</firstterm>.  For historical reasons, &os;
	  calls these primary partition
	  <firstterm>slices</firstterm>.  One of these primary
	  partitions can be made into an <firstterm>extended
	    partition</firstterm> containing multiple
	  <firstterm>logical partitions</firstterm>.  The
	  <firstterm>GUID Partition Table</firstterm>
	  (<acronym>GPT</acronym>) is a newer and simpler method of
	  partitioning a disk.  Common <acronym>GPT</acronym>
	  implementations allow up to 128 partitions per disk,
	  eliminating the need for logical partitions.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>Some older operating systems, like &windows;&nbsp;XP,
	    are not compatible with the <acronym>GPT</acronym>
	    partition scheme.  If &os; will be sharing a disk with
	    such an operating system, <acronym>MBR</acronym>
	    partitioning is required.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>The &os; boot loader requires either a primary or
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym> partition.  If all of the primary or
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym> partitions are already in use, one
	  must be freed for &os;.  To create a partition without
	  deleting existing data, use a partition resizing tool to
	  shrink an existing partition and create a new partition
	  using the freed space.</para>

	<para>A variety of free and commercial partition resizing
	  tools are listed at <link
	    xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disk_partitioning_software">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disk_partitioning_software</link>.
	  <application>GParted Live</application> (<link
	    xlink:href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php</link>)
	  is a free live <acronym>CD</acronym> which includes the
	  <application>GParted</application> partition editor.
	  <application>GParted</application> is also included with
	  many other Linux live <acronym>CD</acronym>
	  distributions.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>When used properly, disk shrinking utilities can
	    safely create space for creating a new partition.  Since
	    the possibility of selecting the wrong partition exists,
	    always backup any important data and verify the integrity
	    of the backup before modifying disk partitions.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>Disk partitions containing different operating systems
	  make it possible to install multiple operating systems on
	  one computer.  An alternative is to use virtualization
	  (<xref linkend="virtualization"/>) which allows multiple
	  operating systems to run at the same time without modifying
	  any disk partitions.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<title>Collect Network Information</title>

	<para>Some &os; installation methods require a network
	  connection in order to download the installation files.
	  After any installation, the installer will offer to setup
	  the system's network interfaces.</para>

	<para>If the network has a <acronym>DHCP</acronym> server, it
	  can be used to provide automatic network configuration.  If
	  <acronym>DHCP</acronym> is not available, the following
	  network information for the system must be obtained from the
	  local network administrator or Internet service
	  provider:</para>

	<orderedlist xml:id="bsdinstall-collect-network-information">
	  <title>Required Network Information</title>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><acronym>IP</acronym> address</para>

	      <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </step>

      <step>
	<title>Check for &os; Errata</title>

	<para>Although the &os;&nbsp;Project strives to ensure that
	  each release of &os; is as stable as possible, bugs
	  occasionally creep into the process.  On very rare occasions
	  those bugs affect the installation process.  As these
	  problems are discovered and fixed, they are noted in the
	  &os; Errata (<link
	    xlink:href="&url.base;/releases/&rel.current;R/errata.html">http://www.freebsd.org/releases/&rel.current;R/errata.html</link>)
	  on the &os; web site.  Check the errata before installing to
	  make sure that there are no problems that might affect the
	  installation.</para>

	<para>Information and errata for all the releases can be found
	  on the release information section of the &os; web site
	  (<link
	    xlink:href="&url.base;/releases/index.html">http://www.freebsd.org/releases/index.html</link>).</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <sect2 xml:id="bsdinstall-installation-media">
      <title>Prepare the Installation Media</title>

      <para>The &os; installer is not an application that can be run
	from within another operating system.  Instead, download a
	&os; installation file, burn it to the media associated with
	its file type and size (<acronym>CD</acronym>,
	<acronym>DVD</acronym>, or <acronym>USB</acronym>), and boot
	the system to install from the inserted media.</para>

	Each installation file's name includes the release version of
	&os;, the architecture, and the type of file.  For example, to

    <sect2 xml:id="configtuning-initial">
      <title>Designing the Partition Layout</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><filename>/usr</filename></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>When laying out file systems, remember that hard drives
	transfer data faster from the outer tracks to the inner.
	Thus, smaller and heavier-accessed file systems should be
	closer to the outside of the drive, while larger partitions
	like <filename>/usr</filename> should be placed toward the
	inner parts of the disk.  It is a good idea to create
	partitions in an order similar to: <filename>/</filename>,
	swap, <filename>/var</filename>, and
	<filename>/usr</filename>.</para>

      <para>The size of the <filename>/var</filename> partition
	reflects the intended machine's usage.  This partition is
	used to hold mailboxes, log files, and printer spools.
	Mailboxes and log files can grow to unexpected sizes
	depending on the number of users and how long log files are
	kept.  On average, most users rarely need more than about a
	gigabyte of free disk space in
	<filename>/var</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Sometimes, a lot of disk space is required in
	  <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.  When new software is
	  installed, the packaging tools extract a temporary copy of
	  the packages under <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.  Large
	  software packages, like <application>Firefox</application>,
	  <application>Apache OpenOffice</application> or
	  <application>LibreOffice</application> may be tricky to
	  install if there is not enough disk space under
	  <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The <filename>/usr</filename> partition holds many of the
	files which support the system, including the &os; Ports
	Collection and system source code.  At least 2 gigabytes is
	recommended for this partition.</para>

      <para>When selecting partition sizes, keep the space
	requirements in mind.  Running out of space in one partition

      <para>As a rule of thumb, the swap partition should be about
	double the size of physical memory (<acronym>RAM</acronym>).
	Systems with minimal <acronym>RAM</acronym> may perform
	better with more swap.  Configuring too little swap can lead
	to inefficiencies in the <acronym>VM</acronym> page scanning
	code and might create issues later if more memory is
	added.</para>

      <para>On larger systems with multiple <acronym>SCSI</acronym>
	disks or multiple <acronym>IDE</acronym> disks operating on
	different controllers, it is recommended that swap be
	configured on each drive, up to four drives.  The swap
	partitions should be approximately the same size.  The
	kernel can handle arbitrary sizes but internal data structures
	scale to 4 times the largest swap partition.  Keeping the swap
	partitions near the same size will allow the kernel to
	optimally stripe swap space across disks.  Large swap sizes
	are fine, even if swap is not used much.  It might be easier
	to recover from a runaway program before being forced to
	reboot.</para>

      <para>By properly partitioning a system, fragmentation
	introduced in the smaller write heavy partitions will not
	bleed over into the mostly read partitions.  Keeping the
	write loaded partitions closer to the disk's edge will
	increase <acronym> I/O</acronym> performance in the
	partitions where it occurs the most.  While
	<acronym>I/O</acronym> performance in the larger partitions
	may be needed, shifting them more toward the edge of the disk
	will not lead to a significant performance improvement over
	moving <filename>/var</filename> to the edge.</para>

	<literal>freebsd-zfs</literal>, used for partitions that will
	contain a &os; <acronym>ZFS</acronym> file system (<xref
	  linkend="zfs"/>).  Refer to &man.gpart.8; for
	descriptions of the available <acronym>GPT</acronym> partition
	types.</para>

      <para>Multiple file system partitions can be created and some
	people prefer a traditional layout with separate partitions
	for <filename>/</filename>, <filename>/var</filename>,
	<filename>/tmp</filename>, and <filename>/usr</filename>.  See
	<xref linkend="bsdinstall-part-manual-splitfs"/> for an
	example.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Size</literal> may be entered with common
	abbreviations: <emphasis>K</emphasis> for kilobytes,
	<emphasis>M</emphasis> for megabytes, or
	<emphasis>G</emphasis> for gigabytes.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Proper sector alignment provides the best performance,
	  and making partition sizes even multiples of 4K bytes helps
	  to ensure alignment on drives with either 512-byte or
	  4K-byte sectors.  Generally, using partition sizes that are
	  even multiples of 1M or 1G is the easiest way to make sure
	  every partition starts at an even multiple of 4K.  There is
	  one exception: the <emphasis>freebsd-boot</emphasis>
	  partition should be no larger than 512K due to current boot
	  code limitations.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>A <literal>Mountpoint</literal> is needed if the partition
	will contain a file system.  If only a single
	<acronym>UFS</acronym> partition will be created, the
	mountpoint should be <filename>/</filename>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Label</literal> is a name by which the
	partition will be known.  Drive names or numbers can change if
	the drive is connected to a different controller or port, but
	the partition label does not change.  Referring to labels
	instead of drive names and partition numbers in files like
	<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> makes the system more tolerant
	to hardware changes.  <acronym>GPT</acronym> labels appear in
	<filename>/dev/gpt/</filename> when a disk is attached.  Other
	partitioning schemes have different label capabilities and
	their labels appear in different directories in
	<filename>/dev/</filename>.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Use a unique label on every partition to avoid
	  conflicts from identical labels.  A few letters from the
	  computer's name, use, or location can be added to the label.
	  For instance, use <literal>labroot</literal> or
	  <literal>rootfslab</literal> for the <acronym>UFS</acronym>
	  root partition on the computer named
	  <literal>lab</literal>.</para>

      <title>Root-on-ZFS Automatic Partitioning</title>

      <para>Support for automatic creation of root-on-ZFS
	installations was added in &os; 10.0-RELEASE.  This
	partitioning mode only works with whole disks and will erase
	the contents of the entire disk.  The installer will
	automatically create partitions aligned to 4k boundaries and
	force <acronym>ZFS</acronym> to use 4k sectors.  This is safe
	even with 512 byte sector disks, and has the added benefit of
	ensuring that pools created on 512 byte disks will be able to
	have 4k sector disks added in the future, either as additional
	storage space or as replacements for failed disks.  The
	installer can also optionally employ <acronym>GELI</acronym>
	disk encryption as described in <xref
	  linkend="disks-encrypting-geli"/>.
	If encryption is enabled, a 2&nbsp;GB unencrypted boot pool
	containing the <filename>/boot</filename> directory is
	created.  It holds the kernel and other files necessary to
	boot the system.  A swap partition of a user selectable size
	is also created, and all remaining space is used for the

    <para>This section covers basic installation
      troubleshooting, such as common problems people have
      reported.</para>

    <para>Check the Hardware Notes (<link
	xlink:href="&url.base;/releases/index.html">http://www.freebsd.org/releases/index.html</link>)
      document for the version of &os; to make sure the hardware is
      supported.  If the hardware is supported and lock-ups or other
      problems occur, build a custom kernel using the instructions in
      <xref linkend="kernelconfig"/> to add support for devices which
      are not present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  The
      default kernel assumes that most hardware devices are in their
      factory default configuration in terms of
      <acronym>IRQ</acronym>s, <acronym>I/O</acronym> addresses, and
      <acronym>DMA</acronym> channels.  If the hardware has been
      reconfigured, a custom kernel configuration file can tell &os;
      where to find things.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Some installation problems can be avoided or alleviated by
	updating the firmware on various hardware components, most
	notably the motherboard.  Motherboard firmware is usually
	referred to as the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.  Most motherboard
	and computer manufacturers have a website for upgrades and
	upgrade information.</para>

      <para>Manufacturers generally advise against upgrading the
	motherboard <acronym>BIOS</acronym> unless there is a good
	reason for doing so, like a critical update.  The upgrade
	process <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, leaving the
	<acronym>BIOS</acronym> incomplete and the computer
	inoperative.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If the system hangs while probing hardware during boot, or
      it behaves strangely during install, <acronym>ACPI</acronym> may
      be the culprit.  &os; makes extensive use of the system
      <acronym>ACPI</acronym> service on the &arch.i386;,
      &arch.amd64;, and ia64 platforms to aid in system configuration
      if it is detected during boot.  Unfortunately, some bugs still
      exist in both the <acronym>ACPI</acronym> driver and within
      system motherboards and <acronym>BIOS</acronym> firmware.
      <acronym>ACPI</acronym> can be disabled by setting the
      <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled</literal> hint in the third stage
      boot loader:</para>

    <screen><userinput>set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</userinput></screen>

    <para>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it is
      necessary to add <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</literal> to
      the file <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  More
      information about the boot loader can be found in <xref
	linkend="boot-synopsis"/>.</para>

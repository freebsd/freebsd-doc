    <para>&os; comes with a text-based, easy to use installation
      program.  &os;&nbsp;9.0-RELEASE and later use an installation
      program called <application>bsdinstall</application>, while
      releases prior to &os;&nbsp;9.0-RELEASE using
      <application>sysinstall</application> for installation.  This
      chapter describes the use of
      <application>bsdinstall</application>.  The use of
      <application>sysinstall</application> is covered in <xref

      <para>The minimal configuration to install &os; varies with the
	&os; version and the hardware architecture.</para>

      <para>A summary of this information is given in the following
	sections.  Depending on the method you choose to install &os;,
	you may also need a supported CDROM drive, and in some cases a

	  at least 64&nbsp;MB of RAM.  At least 1.1&nbsp;GB of free
	  hard drive space is needed for the most minimal
	  installation.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>On old computers, increasing RAM and hard drive space

	<para>The second class of processors that can use
	  &os;/&arch.amd64; includes those using the

      <title>Decide Where to Install &os;</title>

      <para>If &os; will be the only operating system installed, and

	this section can be skipped.  But if &os; will share the disk
	with other operating systems, an understanding of disk

      <sect3 id="bsdinstall-where-i386">
	<title>Disk Layouts for &os;/&arch.i386; and
	  &os;/&arch.amd64;</title>

	<para>Hard disks can be divided into multiple sections.  These
	  sections are called
	  <firstterm>partitions</firstterm>.</para>

	<para>There are two ways of dividing a disk into partitions.
	  A traditional <firstterm>Master Boot Record</firstterm>
	  (<acronym role="Master Boot Record">MBR</acronym>) holds a
	  partition table defining up to four <firstterm>primary
	    partitions</firstterm>.  (For historical reasons, &os;
	  calls primary partitions <firstterm>slices</firstterm>.)  A
	  limit of only four partitions is restrictive for large
	  disks, so one of these primary partitions can be made into
	  an <firstterm>extended partition</firstterm>.  Multiple
	  <firstterm>logical partitions</firstterm> may then be
	  created inside the extended partition.  This may sound a
	  little unwieldy, and it is.</para>

	<para>The <firstterm>GUID Partition Table</firstterm>
	  (<acronym role="GUID Partition Table">GPT</acronym>) is a
	  newer and simpler method of partitioning a disk.  <acronym
	    role="GUID Partition Table">GPT</acronym> is far more
	  versatile than the traditional MBR partition table.  Common
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym> implementations allow up to 128
	  partitions per disk, eliminating the need for inconvenient
	  workarounds like logical partitions.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>Some older operating systems like &windows;&nbsp;XP
	    are not compatible with the <acronym>GPT</acronym>
	    partition scheme.  If &os; will be sharing a disk with
	    such an operating system, <acronym role="Master Boot
	      Record">MBR</acronym> partitioning is required.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>&os;'s standard boot loader requires either a primary or
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym> partition.  (See <xref
	    linkend="boot"/> for more information about the &os;
	  booting process.)  If all of the primary or
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym> partitions are already in use, one
	  must be freed for &os;.</para>

	<para>A minimal installation of &os; takes as little as
	  1&nbsp;GB of disk space.  However, that is a
	  <emphasis>very</emphasis> minimal install, leaving almost no
	  free space.  A more realistic minimum is 3&nbsp;GB without a
	  graphical environment, and 5&nbsp;GB or more if a graphical
	  user interface will be used.  Third-party application
	  software requires more space.</para>

	<para>A variety of <ulink
	    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disk_partitioning_software">
	    free and commercial partition resizing tools</ulink> are
	  available.  <ulink
	    url="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">GParted
	  Live</ulink> is a free Live CD which includes the <application>GParted</application>
	  partition editor.  <application>GParted</application> is also included with many other
	  Linux Live CD distributions.</para>

	<warning>
	  <para>Disk partition applications can destroy data.  Make a
	    full backup and verify its integrity before modifying disk
	    partitions.</para>
	</warning>

	<para>Resizing &microsoft;&nbsp;Vista partitions can be
	  difficult.  A Vista installation CDROM can be useful when
	  attempting such an operation.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using an Existing Partition</title>

	  <para>A &windows; computer has a single 40&nbsp;GB disk that
	    has been split into two 20&nbsp;GB partitions.  &windows;
	    calls them <devicename>C:</devicename> and
	    <devicename>D:</devicename>.  The
	    <devicename>C:</devicename> partition contains 10&nbsp;GB
	    of data, and the <devicename>D:</devicename> partition
	    contains 5&nbsp;GB of data.</para>

	  <para>Moving the data from <devicename>D:</devicename> to
	    <devicename>C:</devicename> frees up the second partition
	    to be used for &os;.</para>
	</example>

	<example>
	  <title>Shrinking an Existing Partition</title>

	  <para>A &windows; computer has a single 40&nbsp;GB disk and
	    one large partition using the whole disk.  &windows; shows
	    this 40&nbsp;GB partition as a single
	    <devicename>C:</devicename>.  15&nbsp;GB of space is being
	    used.  The goal is to end up with &windows; in a
	    20&nbsp;GB partition, and have another 20&nbsp;GB
	    partition for &os;.</para>

	  <para>There are two ways to do this:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Back up your &windows; data.  Then reinstall
		&windows;, creating a 20&nbsp;GB partition during the

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Use a partition resizing tool like

	  </orderedlist>
	</example>

	<para>Disk partitions containing different operating systems
	  make it possible to run any one of those operating systems
	  at a time.  An alternative method that allows running
	  multiple operating systems at the same time is covered in
	  <xref linkend="virtualization"/>.</para>

      <title>Check for &os; Errata</title>

      <para>Although the &os;&nbsp;Project strives to ensure that each
	release of &os; is as stable as possible, bugs occasionally
	creep into the process.  On very rare occasions those bugs
	affect the installation process.  As these problems are
	discovered and fixed, they are noted in the <ulink
	  url="&url.base;/releases/&rel.current;R/errata.html">FreeBSD
	Errata</ulink> on the &os; web site.  Check the errata before
	installing to make sure that there are no problems that might
	affect the installation.</para>

      <para>Information and errata for all the releases can be found

    <sect2 id="bsdinstall-installation-media">
      <title>Prepare the Installation Media</title>

      <para>A &os; installation is started by booting the computer
	with a &os; installation CD, DVD, or USB memory stick.  The
	installer is not a program that can be run from within another
	operating system.</para>

      <para>In addition to the standard installation media which
	contains copies of all the &os; installation files, there is a
	<emphasis>bootonly</emphasis> variant.  Bootonly install media
	does not have copies of the installation files, but downloads
	them from the network during an install.  The bootonly install
	CD is consequently much smaller, and reduces bandwidth usage
	during the install by only downloading required files.</para>

      <para>Copies of &os; installation media are available at the

      <para>A standard &os; <acronym>GPT</acronym> installation uses

      <itemizedlist>
	<title>Standard &os; <acronym>GPT</acronym> Partitions</title>

	<listitem>
	  <para><literal>freebsd-boot</literal> - &os; boot

	  <para><literal>freebsd-swap</literal> - &os; swap
	    space.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Another partition type worth noting is
	<literal>freebsd-zfs</literal>, used for partitions that will
	contain a &os; ZFS filesystem.  See
	<xref linkend="filesystems-zfs"/>.  &man.gpart.8; shows more
	of the available <acronym>GPT</acronym> partition
	types.</para>

      <para>Multiple filesystem partitions can be used, and some
	people may prefer a traditional layout with separate
	partitions for the <filename>/</filename>,
	<filename>/var</filename>, <filename>/tmp</filename>, and
	<filename>/usr</filename> filesystems.  See
	<xref linkend="bsdinstall-part-manual-splitfs"/> for an
	example.</para>

      <para>Size may be entered with common abbreviations:
	<emphasis>K</emphasis> for kilobytes, <emphasis>M</emphasis>
	for megabytes, or <emphasis>G</emphasis> for gigabytes.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Proper sector alignment provides the best performance,
	  and making partition sizes even multiples of 4K bytes helps
	  to ensure alignment on drives with either 512-byte or
	  4K-byte sectors.  Generally, using partition sizes that are
	  even multiples of 1M or 1G is the easiest way to make sure
	  every partition starts at an even multiple of 4K.  One
	  exception: at present, the <emphasis>freebsd-boot</emphasis>
	  partition should be no larger than 512K due to boot code
	  limitations.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>A mountpoint is needed if this partition will contain a
	filesystem.  If only a single UFS partition will be created,
	the mountpoint should be <filename>/</filename>.</para>

      <para>A <firstterm>label</firstterm> is also requested.  A label
	is a name by which this partition will be known.  Drive
	names or numbers can change if the drive is connected to
	a different controller or port, but the partition label does
	not change.  Referring to labels instead of drive names
	and partition numbers in files like
	<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> makes the system more tolerant
	of changing hardware.  GPT labels appear in
	<filename>/dev/gpt/</filename> when a disk is attached.
	Other partitioning schemes have different label
	capabilities, and their labels appear in different directories
	in <filename>/dev/</filename>.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>Use a unique label on every filesystem to avoid
	  conflicts from identical labels.  A few letters from the
	  computer's name, use, or location can be added to the label.
	  "labroot" or "rootfs-lab" for the UFS root partition on the
	  lab's computer, for example.</para>

    <para>The following section covers basic installation
      troubleshooting, such as common problems people have
      reported.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>What to Do If Something Goes Wrong</title>

      <para>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is
	impossible for probing to be 100% reliable, however, there are
	a few things you can do if it fails.</para>

      <para>Check the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html">Hardware
	  Notes</ulink> document for your version of &os; to make sure
	your hardware is supported.</para>

      <para>If your hardware is supported and you still experience
	lock-ups or other problems, you will need to build a
	<link linkend="kernelconfig">custom kernel</link>.  This will
	allow you to add in support for devices which are not present
	in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  The kernel on the
	boot disks is configured assuming that most hardware devices
	are in their factory default configuration in terms of IRQs,
	IO addresses, and DMA channels.  If your hardware has been
	reconfigured, you will most likely need to edit the kernel
	configuration and recompile to tell &os; where to find
	things.</para>

      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present
	will cause a later probe for another device that is present to
	fail.  In that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s)
	should be disabled.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Some installation problems can be avoided or alleviated
	  by updating the firmware on various hardware components,
	  most notably the motherboard.  Motherboard firmware is
	  usually referred to as the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>.  Most
	  motherboard and computer manufacturers have a website for
	  upgrades and upgrade information.</para>

	<para>Manufacturers generally advise against upgrading the
	  motherboard <acronym>BIOS</acronym> unless there is a good
	  reason for doing so, like a critical update.  The upgrade
	  process <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, leaving the
	  <acronym>BIOS</acronym> incomplete and the computer
	  inoperative.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>My system hangs while probing hardware during boot,
	      or it behaves strangely during install.</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>&os; makes extensive use of the system
	      ACPI service on the i386, amd64, and ia64 platforms to
	      aid in system configuration if it is detected during
	      boot.  Unfortunately, some bugs still exist in both the
	      ACPI driver and within system motherboards and
	      <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
	      firmware.  ACPI can be disabled by setting
	      the <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled</literal> hint in the
	      third stage boot loader:</para>

	    <screen><userinput>set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</userinput></screen>

	    <para>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it
	      is necessary to
	      add <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</literal> to the
	      file
	      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  More
	      information about the boot loader can be found
	      in <xref linkend="boot-synopsis"/>.</para>

    <title>Using the Live CD</title>

    <para>A live CD of &os; is available on the same CD as the main

    <para>The kernel is the core of the &os; operating system.  It is
      responsible for managing memory, enforcing security controls,
      networking, disk access, and much more.  While more and more of &os;
      becomes dynamically configurable it is still occasionally necessary to
      reconfigure and recompile your kernel.</para>

    <title>Why Build a Custom Kernel?</title>

    <para>Traditionally, &os; has had what is called a
      <quote>monolithic</quote> kernel.  This means that the kernel was one
      large program, supported a fixed list of devices, and if you wanted to
      change the kernel's behavior then you had to compile a new kernel, and
      then reboot your computer with the new kernel.</para>

    <para>Today, &os; is rapidly moving to a model where much of the
      kernel's functionality is contained in modules which can be
      dynamically loaded and unloaded from the kernel as necessary.
      This allows the kernel to adapt to new hardware suddenly
      becoming available (such as PCMCIA cards in a laptop), or for
      new functionality to be brought into the kernel that was not
      necessary when the kernel was originally compiled.  This is
      known as a modular kernel.</para>

    <para>Despite this, it is still necessary to carry out some static kernel
      configuration.  In some cases this is because the functionality is so
      tied to the kernel that it can not be made dynamically loadable.  In
      others it may simply be because no one has yet taken the time to write a
      dynamic loadable kernel module for that functionality.</para>

    <para>Building a custom kernel is one of the most important rites of
      passage nearly every BSD user must endure.  This process, while
      time consuming, will provide many benefits to your &os; system.
      Unlike the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which must support a
      wide range of hardware, a custom kernel only contains support for
      <emphasis>your</emphasis> PC's hardware.  This has a number of
      benefits, such as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Faster boot time.  Since the kernel will only probe the
	hardware you have on your system, the time it takes your system to
	boot can decrease dramatically.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Lower memory usage.  A custom kernel often uses less memory
	  than the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which is important
	  because the kernel must always be present in real
	  memory.  For this reason, a custom kernel is especially useful
	  on a system with a small amount of RAM.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Additional hardware support.  A custom kernel allows you to
	  add in support for devices which are not
	  present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, such as
	  sound cards.</para>
      </listitem>

  <sect1 id="kernelconfig-building">
    <title>Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>building / installing</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>First, let us take a quick tour of the kernel build directory.
      All directories mentioned will be relative to the main
      <filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory, which is also
      accessible through the path name <filename>/sys</filename>.  There are a number of
      subdirectories here representing different parts of the kernel, but
      the most important for our purposes are
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename>, where you
      will edit your custom kernel configuration, and
      <filename>compile</filename>, which is the staging area where your
      kernel will be built.  <replaceable>arch</replaceable> represents
      one of <filename>i386</filename>, <filename>alpha</filename>,
      <filename>amd64</filename>, <filename>ia64</filename>,
      <filename>powerpc</filename>, <filename>sparc64</filename>, or
      <filename>pc98</filename> (an alternative development branch of PC
      hardware, popular in Japan).  Everything inside a particular
      architecture's directory deals with that architecture only; the rest
      of the code is machine independent code common to all platforms to which &os; could
      potentially be ported.  Notice the logical organization of the
      directory structure, with each supported device, file system, and
      option in its own subdirectory.  Versions of &os; prior to 5.X
      support only the <filename>i386</filename>, <filename>alpha</filename>
      and <filename>pc98</filename> architectures.</para>

    <para>This chapter assumes that you are using the i386 architecture
      in the examples.  If this is not the case for your situation,
      make appropriate adjustments to the path names for your system's
      architecture.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If there is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
	<filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory on your system,
	then the kernel source has not been installed.  The easiest
	way to do this is by running
	<command>sysinstall</command> (<command>/stand/sysinstall</command>
	in &os; versions older than 5.2) as
	<username>root</username>, choosing
	<guimenuitem>Configure</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>Distributions</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>src</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>sys</guimenuitem>.  If you have an aversion to
	<application>sysinstall</application> and you have access to
	an <quote>official</quote> &os; CDROM, then you can also
	install the source from the command line:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /cdrom</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /usr/src/sys /sys</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cat /cdrom/src/ssys.[a-d]* | tar -xzvf -</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Next, move to the
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename> directory
      and copy the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file to the
      name you want to give your kernel.  For example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>

    <para>Traditionally, this name is in all capital letters and, if you
      are maintaining multiple &os; machines with different hardware,
      it is a good idea to name it after your machine's hostname.  We will
      call it <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> for the purpose of this
      example.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Storing your kernel configuration file directly under
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> can be a bad idea.  If you are
	experiencing problems it can be tempting to just delete
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> and start again.  After doing this,
	it usually only takes a few seconds for
	you to realize that you have deleted your custom kernel
	configuration file.  Also, do not edit <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	directly, as it may get overwritten the next time you
	<link linkend="cutting-edge">update your source tree</link>, and
	your kernel modifications will be lost.</para>

      <para>You might want to keep your kernel configuration file
	elsewhere, and then create a symbolic link to the file in
	the <filename><replaceable>i386</replaceable></filename>
	directory.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /root/kernels</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput>	
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </tip>

    <para>Now, edit <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> with your favorite text
      editor.  If you are just starting out, the only editor available
      will probably be <application>vi</application>, which is too complex to
      explain here, but is covered well in many books in the <link
      linkend="bibliography">bibliography</link>.  However, &os; does
      offer an easier editor called <application>ee</application> which, if
      you are a beginner, should be your editor of choice.  Feel free to
      change the comment lines at the top to reflect your configuration or
      the changes you have made to differentiate it from
      <filename>GENERIC</filename>.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>SunOS</primary></indexterm>

    <para>If you have built a kernel under &sunos; or some other BSD
      operating system, much of this file will be very familiar to you.
      If you are coming from some other operating system such as DOS, on
      the other hand, the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file
      might seem overwhelming to you, so follow the descriptions in the
      <link linkend="kernelconfig-config">Configuration File</link>
      section slowly and carefully.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you <link
        linkend="cutting-edge">sync your source tree</link> with the
        latest sources of the &os; project,
        be sure to always check the file
        <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> before you perform any update
        steps.  This file describes any important issues or areas
        requiring special attention within the updated source code.
        <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> always matches
        your version of the &os; source, and is therefore more up to date
        with new information than this handbook.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You must now compile the source code for the kernel.  There are two
      procedures you can use to do this, and the one you will use depends on
      why you are rebuilding the kernel and the version of &os; that you are
      running.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>If you have installed <emphasis>only</emphasis> the kernel
	  source code, use procedure 1.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you are running a &os; version prior to 4.0, and you are
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> upgrading to &os;&nbsp;4.0 or higher using
	  the <command>make buildworld</command> procedure, use procedure 1.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you are building a new kernel without updating the source
	  code (perhaps just to add a new option, such as
	  <literal>IPFIREWALL</literal>) you can use either procedure.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you are rebuilding the kernel as part of a
          <command>make buildworld</command> process, use procedure 2.

      (you have not run <application>CVSup</application>,

    <note>
      <para>This method of kernel building requires full source files.  If you
	only installed the kernel source, use the traditional method, as
	described above.</para>
    </note>

    <tip>
      <para>By default, when you build a custom kernel,
	<emphasis>all</emphasis> kernel modules will be rebuilt as well.
	If you want to update a kernel faster or to build only custom
	modules, you should edit <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>
	before starting to build the kernel:</para>

      <programlisting>MODULES_OVERRIDE = linux acpi sound/sound sound/driver/ds1 ntfs</programlisting>

      <para>This variable sets up a list of modules to build instead
	of all of them.  For other variables which you may find useful
	in the process of building kernel, refer to &man.make.conf.5;
	manual page.</para>
    </tip>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><filename class="directory">/boot/kernel.old</filename></primary>

    <para>The new kernel will be copied to the <filename
        class="directory">/boot/kernel</filename> directory as
      <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename> and the old kernel will be moved to
      <filename>/boot/kernel.old/kernel</filename>.  Now, shutdown the system and
      reboot to use your new kernel.  If something goes wrong, there are
      some <link linkend="kernelconfig-trouble">troubleshooting</link>
      instructions at the end of this chapter that you may find useful.  Be sure to read the
      section which explains how to recover in case your new kernel <link
      linkend="kernelconfig-noboot">does not boot</link>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>In &os; 4.X and earlier, kernels are installed
	in <filename>/kernel</filename>, modules in <filename
          class="directory">/modules</filename>, and old kernels
	are backed up in <filename>/kernel.old</filename>.
	Other files relating to the boot process, such as the boot
	&man.loader.8; and configuration are stored in
	<filename>/boot</filename>.  Third party or custom modules
	can be placed in <filename class="directory">/modules</filename>, although
	users should be aware that keeping modules in sync with the
	compiled kernel is very important.  Modules not intended
	to run with the compiled kernel may result in instability
	or incorrectness.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>If you have added any new devices (such as sound cards)
	and you are running &os;&nbsp;4.X or previous versions, you
	may have to add some device nodes to your
	<filename class="directory">/dev</filename> directory before
	you can use them. For more information, take a look at <link

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>configuration file</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The general format of a configuration file is quite simple.
      Each line contains a keyword and one or more arguments.  For
      simplicity, most lines only contain one argument.  Anything
      following a <literal>#</literal> is considered a comment and
      ignored.  The following sections describe each keyword, in
      the order they are listed in <filename>GENERIC</filename>.
      <anchor
      id="kernelconfig-options"> For an exhaustive list of architecture
      dependent options and devices, see the <filename>NOTES</filename>
      file in the same directory as <filename>GENERIC</filename>. For
      architecture independent options, see
      <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename>.</para>

    <note>
      <para><filename>NOTES</filename> does not exist in &os;&nbsp;4.X.
        Instead, see the <filename>LINT</filename> file for detailed
        explanations of options and devices in <filename>GENERIC</filename>.
        <filename>LINT</filename> served two purposes in 4.X: to provide a
        reference for choosing kernel options when building a custom
        kernel, and to provide a kernel configuration with as many
        tweakable options tweaked to non-default values as possible. The
        reason behind this was that such a configuration helped (and still
        does) a lot when testing new code and changes to existing code that
        may cause conflicts with other parts of the kernel. However,
        the kernel configuration framework went through some heavy changes
        in 5.X; one example of this is that the driver configuration options were moved
        to a <literal>hints</literal> file so that they could be changed
        and loaded dynamically at boot time, and <filename>LINT</filename>
        could not contain those hints anymore.  For this and other
        reasons, the <filename>LINT</filename> file was renamed to
        <filename>NOTES</filename> and retained mostly the first reason for
        its existence: documenting the available options for user
        convenience.</para>

      <para>In &os; 5.X and later versions you can still generate a buildable
	<filename>LINT</filename> file by typing:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf &amp;&amp; make LINT</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>configuration file</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The following is an example of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel
      configuration file with various additional comments where needed for
      clarity.  This example should match your copy in
      <filename>/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf/GENERIC</filename>
      fairly closely.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel options</primary>
      <secondary>machine</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <programlisting>machine		i386</programlisting>

    <para>This is the machine architecture.  It must be either
      <literal>alpha</literal>, <literal>amd64</literal>,
      <literal>i386</literal>, <literal>ia64</literal>,
      <literal>pc98</literal>, <literal>powerpc</literal>, or

    <programlisting>cpu          I486_CPU
cpu          I586_CPU
cpu          I686_CPU</programlisting>

    <para>The above option specifies the type of CPU you have in your
      system.  You may have multiple instances of the CPU line (if, for
      example, you are not sure whether you should use
      <literal>I586_CPU</literal> or <literal>I686_CPU</literal>),
      but for a custom kernel it is best to specify only the CPU
      you have.  If you are unsure of your CPU type, you can check the
      <filename>/var/run/dmesg.boot</filename> file to view your boot
      messages.</para>

      <primary>kernel options</primary>

    <para>Support for <literal>I386_CPU</literal> is still provided in the
      source of &os;, but it is disabled by default in both -STABLE and
      -CURRENT.  This means that to install &os; with a 386-class cpu, you now
      have the following options:</para>

    <para>This is the identification of the kernel.  You should change
      this to whatever you named your kernel,
      i.e. <literal>MYKERNEL</literal> if you have followed the
      instructions of the previous examples.  The value you put in the
      <literal>ident</literal> string will print when you boot up the
      kernel, so it is useful to give the new kernel a different name if you
      want to keep it separate from your usual kernel (e.g., you want to
      build an experimental kernel).</para>

    <para>In &os; 5.X and newer versions the &man.device.hints.5; is
      used to configure options of the device drivers.  The default
      location that &man.loader.8; will check at boot time is
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.  Using the
      <literal>hints</literal> option you can compile these hints
      statically into your kernel.  Then there is no need to create a
      <filename>device.hints</filename> file in
      <filename>/boot</filename>.</para>

    <programlisting>#makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>

    <para>The normal build process of &os; does not include
      debugging information when building the kernel and strips most
      symbols after the resulting kernel is linked, to save some space
      at the install location.  If you are going to do tests of kernels
      in the -CURRENT branch or develop changes of your own for the &os;
      kernel, you might want to uncomment this line.  It will enable the
      use of the <option>-g</option> option which enables debugging
      information when passed to &man.gcc.1;.  The same can be
      accomplished by the &man.config.8; <option>-g</option> option, if
      you are using the <quote>traditional</quote> way for building your
      kernels (see <xref linkend="kernelconfig-building">
      for more information).</para>

    <programlisting>options          SCHED_4BSD         # 4BSD scheduler</programlisting>

    <para>The traditional scheduler for &os;.  Depending on your system's
      workload, you may gain performance by using the new ULE scheduler for
      &os; that has been designed specially for SMP, but works just fine on UP
      systems too.  If you wish to try it out, replace <literal>SCHED_4BSD</literal>
      with <literal>SCHED_ULE</literal> in your configuration file.</para>

    <programlisting>options          INET              # InterNETworking</programlisting>

    <para>Networking support.  Leave this in, even if you do not plan to
      be connected to a network.  Most programs require at least loopback
      networking (i.e., making network connections within your PC), so
      this is essentially mandatory.</para>

    <programlisting>options          INET6             # IPv6 communications protocols</programlisting>

    <para>This enables the IPv6 communication protocols.</para>

    <programlisting>options          FFS               # Berkeley Fast Filesystem</programlisting>

    <para>This is the basic hard drive file system.  Leave it in if you
      boot from the hard disk.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SOFTUPDATES       # Enable FFS Soft Updates support</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel, this will
      help speed up write access on the disks.  Even when this
      functionality is provided by the kernel, it must be turned on
      for specific disks.  Review the output from &man.mount.8; to see
      if Soft Updates is enabled for your system disks.  If you do not
      see the <literal>soft-updates</literal> option then you will
      need to activate it using the &man.tunefs.8; (for existing
      file systems) or &man.newfs.8; (for new file systems)
      commands.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_ACL           # Support for access control lists</programlisting>

    <para>This option, present only in &os;&nbsp;5.X, enables kernel support
      for access control lists.  This relies on the use of extended
      attributes and <acronym>UFS2</acronym>, and the feature is described
      in detail in <xref linkend="fs-acl">.  <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are
      enabled by default and should not be
      disabled in the kernel if they have been used previously on a file
      system, as this will remove the access control lists, changing the
      way files are protected in unpredictable ways.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_DIRHASH       # Improve performance on big directories</programlisting>

    <para>This option includes functionality to speed up disk
      operations on large directories, at the expense of using
      additional memory.  You would normally keep this for a large
      server, or interactive workstation, and remove it if you are
      using &os; on a smaller system where memory is at a premium and
      disk access speed is less important, such as a firewall.</para>

    <programlisting>options          MD_ROOT           # MD is a potential root device</programlisting>

      hard drive partition at boot time, you can safely comment this out.
      It will be automatically loaded the first time you mount a DOS

      <filename role="package">emulators/mtools</filename> software
      allows you to access DOS floppies without having to mount and
      unmount them (and does not require <literal>MSDOSFS</literal> at

    <programlisting>options          CD9660            # ISO 9660 Filesystem</programlisting>

    <para>The ISO 9660 file system for CDROMs.  Comment it out if you do
      not have a CDROM drive or only mount data CDs occasionally (since it
      will be dynamically loaded the first time you mount a data CD).
      Audio CDs do not need this file system.</para>

    <programlisting>options          PROCFS            # Process filesystem</programlisting>

    <para>The process file system.  This is a <quote>pretend</quote>
      file system mounted on <filename>/proc</filename> which allows
      programs like &man.ps.1; to give you more information on what
      processes are running.  In &os; 5.X and above, use of <literal>PROCFS</literal>
      is not required under most circumstances, as most
      debugging and monitoring tools have been adapted to run without
      <literal>PROCFS</literal>: unlike in &os; 4.X, new installations of
      &os; 5.X will not mount the process file system by default.
      In addition, 6.X-CURRENT kernels
      making use of <literal>PROCFS</literal> must now also include
      support for <literal>PSEUDOFS</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>options          PSEUDOFS          # Pseudo-filesystem framework</programlisting>

    <programlisting>options          GEOM_GPT          # GUID Partition Tables.</programlisting>

    <para>This option brings the ability to have a large number of
      partitions on a single disk.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_43         # Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP THIS!]</programlisting>

    <para>Compatibility with 4.3BSD.  Leave this in; some programs will
      act strangely if you comment this out.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD4   # Compatible with &os;4</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required on &os;&nbsp;5.X &i386; and Alpha systems
      to support applications compiled on older versions of &os;
      that use older system call interfaces.  It is recommended that
      this option be used on all &i386; and Alpha systems that may
      run older applications; platforms that gained support only in
      5.X, such as ia64 and &sparc64;, do not require this option.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SCSI_DELAY=15000  # Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI</programlisting>

    <para>This causes the kernel to pause for 15 seconds before probing
      each SCSI device in your system.  If you only have IDE hard drives,
      you can ignore this, otherwise you will probably want to lower this
      number, perhaps to 5 seconds, to speed up booting.  Of course, if
      you do this and &os; has trouble recognizing your SCSI devices,
      you will have to raise it again.</para>

    <programlisting>options          KTRACE            # ktrace(1) support</programlisting>

    <para>This enables kernel process tracing, which is useful in
      debugging.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSHM           # SYSV-style shared memory</programlisting>

    <para>This option provides for System&nbsp;V shared memory.  The most
      common use of this is the XSHM extension in X, which many
      graphics-intensive programs will automatically take advantage of for
      extra speed.  If you use X, you will definitely want to include
      this.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVMSG           # SYSV-style message queues</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System&nbsp;V messages.  This option only adds
      a few hundred bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSEM           # SYSV-style semaphores</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System&nbsp;V semaphores.  Less commonly used but only
      adds a few hundred bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The <option>-p</option> option of the &man.ipcs.1; command will
	list any processes using each of these System&nbsp;V facilities.</para>

    <programlisting>options 	     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING # POSIX P1003_1B real-time extensions</programlisting>

    <para>Real-time extensions added in the 1993 &posix;.  Certain
      applications in the Ports Collection use these
      (such as <application>&staroffice;</application>).</para>

    <programlisting>options          KBD_INSTALL_CDEV  # install a CDEV entry in /dev</programlisting>

    <para>This helps debugging by printing easier register definitions for
      reading.</para>

    <programlisting>options          ADAPTIVE_GIANT    # Giant mutex is adaptive.</programlisting>

    <para>Giant is the name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a sleep mutex)
      that protects a large set of kernel resources.  Today, this is an
      unacceptable performance bottleneck which is actively being replaced
      with locks that protect individual resources.  The
      <literal>ADAPTIVE_GIANT</literal> option causes Giant to be included
      in the set of mutexes adaptively spun on.  That is, when a thread
      wants to lock the Giant mutex, but it is already locked by a thread
      on another CPU, the first thread will keep running and wait for the
      lock to be released.  Normally, the thread would instead go back to
      sleep and wait for its next chance to run.  If you are not sure,
      leave this in.</para>

      <para>If you have an internal modem on <devicename>COM4</devicename>

	manual page for &man.sio.4; for more information on the proper
	values to add to your <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.
	Some video cards (notably those based on
	S3 chips) use IO addresses in the form of

	<para>The Physical Address Extension (<acronym>PAE</acronym>)

	  in the 4.X series of &os; beginning with 4.9-RELEASE and
	  in the 5.X series of &os; beginning with 5.1-RELEASE.  Due to
	  the limitations of the Intel memory architecture, no distinction

    <para>This means that you should look for some entries that start with
      <filename>acd0</filename> in the <filename>/dev</filename>
      directory, possibly followed by a letter, such as
      <literal>c</literal>, or preceded by the letter
      <literal>r</literal>, which means a <quote>raw</quote> device.  It
      turns out that those files are not there, so you must change to the
      <filename>/dev</filename> directory and type:</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><command>MAKEDEV</command></primary></indexterm>
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV acd0</userinput></screen>

    <para>When this script finishes, you will find that there are now
      <filename>acd0c</filename> and <filename>racd0c</filename> entries
      in <filename>/dev</filename> so you know that it executed
      correctly.</para>

    <para>For sound cards, the following command creates the appropriate
      entries:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV snd0</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>When creating device nodes for devices such as sound cards, if
	other people have access to your machine, it may be desirable to
	protect the devices from outside access by adding them to the
	<filename>/etc/fbtab</filename> file.  See &man.fbtab.5; for more
	information.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Follow this simple procedure for any other
      non-<filename>GENERIC</filename>  devices which do not have
      entries.</para>

    <note>
      <para>All SCSI controllers use the same set of
	<filename>/dev</filename> entries, so you do not need to create
	these.  Also, network cards and SLIP/PPP pseudo-devices do not
	have entries in <filename>/dev</filename> at all, so you do not
	have to worry about these either.</para>

    <title>If Something Goes Wrong</title>

    <para>There are five categories of trouble that can occur when
      building a custom kernel.  They are:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>config</command> fails:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the &man.config.8; command fails when you
	    give it your kernel description, you have probably made a
	    simple error somewhere.  Fortunately,
	    &man.config.8; will print the line number that it
	    had trouble with, so that you can quickly locate the line
	    containing the error.  For example, if you see:</para>

	  <screen>config: line 17: syntax error</screen>

	  <para>Make sure the
	    keyword is typed correctly by comparing it to the
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel or another
	    reference.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>make</command> fails:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the <command>make</command> command fails, it usually
	    signals an error in your kernel description which is not severe
	    enough for &man.config.8; to catch.  Again, look
	    over your configuration, and if you still cannot resolve the
	    problem, send mail to the &a.questions; with your kernel
	    configuration, and it should be diagnosed quickly.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Installing the new kernel fails:</term>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the kernel compiled fine, but failed to install
	    (the <command>make install</command> or
	    <command>make installkernel</command> command failed),
	    the first thing to check is if your system is running at
	    securelevel 1 or higher (see &man.init.8;).  The kernel
	    installation tries to remove the immutable flag from
	    your kernel and set the immutable flag on the new one.
	    Since securelevel 1 or higher prevents unsetting the immutable
	    flag for any files on the system, the kernel installation needs
	    to be performed at securelevel 0 or lower.</para>

	  <para>The above only applies to &os; 4.X and earlier versions.
	    &os; 5.X, along with later versions, does not set the
	    immutable flag on the kernel and a failure to install a
	    kernel probably indicates a more fundamental problem.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The kernel does not boot:<anchor
	  id="kernelconfig-noboot"></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If your new kernel does not boot, or fails to
	    recognize your devices, do not panic!  Fortunately, &os; has
	    an excellent mechanism for recovering from incompatible
	    kernels.  Simply choose the kernel you want to boot from at
	    the &os; boot loader. You can access this when the system
	    counts down from 10 at the boot menu.  Hit any key except for the
            <keycap>Enter</keycap> key, type <command>unload</command>
            and then type
	    <command>boot /boot/<replaceable>kernel.old</replaceable>/kernel</command>,
            or the filename of any other kernel that will boot properly.
            When reconfiguring a kernel, it is always a good idea to keep
            a kernel that is known to work on hand.</para>

	  <para>After booting with a good kernel you can check over your
	    configuration file and try to build it again.  One helpful
	    resource is the <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> file
	    which records, among other things, all of the kernel messages
	    from every successful boot.  Also, the &man.dmesg.8; command
	    will print the kernel messages from the current boot.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are having trouble building a kernel, make sure
	      to keep a <filename>GENERIC</filename>, or some other kernel
	      that is known to work on hand as a different name that will
	      not get erased on the next build.  You cannot rely on
	      <filename>kernel.old</filename> because when installing a
	      new kernel, <filename>kernel.old</filename> is overwritten
	      with the last installed kernel which may be non-functional.
	      Also, as soon as possible, move the working kernel to the
	      proper <filename class="directory">/boot/kernel</filename>
	      location or commands such
	      as &man.ps.1; may not work properly.  To do this, simply
	      rename the directory containing the good kernel:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/kernel /boot/kernel.bad</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/<replaceable>kernel.good</replaceable> /boot/kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>For versions of &os; prior to 5.X, the proper command to
	      <quote>unlock</quote> the kernel file that
	      <command>make</command> installs (in order to move another
	      kernel back permanently) is:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags noschg /kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>If you find you cannot do this, you are probably running
	      at a &man.securelevel.8; greater than zero.  Edit
	      <literal>kern_securelevel</literal> in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and set it to
	      <literal>-1</literal>, then reboot.  You can change it back
	      to its previous setting when you are happy with your new
	      kernel.</para>

	    <para>And, if you want to <quote>lock</quote> your new kernel
	      into place, or any file for that matter, so that it cannot
	      be moved or tampered with:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags schg /kernel</userinput></screen>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The kernel works, but &man.ps.1; does not work
	  any more:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you have installed a different version of the kernel
	    from the one that the system utilities have been built with,
	    for example, a 5.X kernel on a 4.X system, many system-status
	    commands like &man.ps.1; and &man.vmstat.8; will not work any
	    more.  You should <link linkend="makeworld">recompile and install
	    a world</link> built with the same version of the source tree as
	    your kernel.  This is one reason it is
	    not normally a good idea to use a different version of the
	    kernel from the rest of the operating system.</para>

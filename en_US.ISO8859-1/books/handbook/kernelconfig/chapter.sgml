    <para>The kernel is the core of the &os; operating system.  It is
      responsible for managing memory, enforcing security controls,
      networking, disk access, and much more.  While more and more of &os;
      becomes dynamically configurable it is still occasionally necessary to
      reconfigure and recompile your kernel.</para>

    <title>Why Build a Custom Kernel?</title>

    <para>Traditionally, &os; has had what is called a
      <quote>monolithic</quote> kernel.  This means that the kernel was one
      large program, supported a fixed list of devices, and if you wanted to
      change the kernel's behavior then you had to compile a new kernel, and
      then reboot your computer with the new kernel.</para>

    <para>Today, &os; is rapidly moving to a model where much of the
      kernel's functionality is contained in modules which can be
      dynamically loaded and unloaded from the kernel as necessary.
      This allows the kernel to adapt to new hardware suddenly
      becoming available (such as PCMCIA cards in a laptop), or for
      new functionality to be brought into the kernel that was not
      necessary when the kernel was originally compiled.  This is
      known as a modular kernel.</para>

    <para>Despite this, it is still necessary to carry out some static kernel
      configuration.  In some cases this is because the functionality is so
      tied to the kernel that it can not be made dynamically loadable.  In
      others it may simply be because no one has yet taken the time to write a
      dynamic loadable kernel module for that functionality.</para>

    <para>Building a custom kernel is one of the most important rites of
      passage for advanced BSD users.  This process, while
      time consuming, will provide many benefits to your &os; system.
      Unlike the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which must support a
      wide range of hardware, a custom kernel only contains support for
      <emphasis>your</emphasis> PC's hardware.  This has a number of
      benefits, such as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Faster boot time.  Since the kernel will only probe the
	hardware you have on your system, the time it takes your system to
	boot can decrease dramatically.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Lower memory usage.  A custom kernel often uses less memory
	  than the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by omitting unused
	  features and device drivers.  This is important because the kernel
	  code remains resident in physical memory at all times, preventing
	  that memory from being used by applications.
	  For this reason, a custom kernel is especially useful
	  on a system with a small amount of RAM.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Additional hardware support.  A custom kernel allows you to
	  add in support for devices which are not
	  present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, such as
	  sound cards.</para>

    <title>Finding the System Hardware</title>
    
    <para>Before venturing into kernel configuration, it would be wise
      to get an inventory of the machine's hardware.  In cases where
      &os; is not the primary operating system, the inventory list may
      easily be created by viewing the current operating system
      configuration.  For example, &microsoft;'s
      <application>Device Manager</application> normally contains
      important information about installed devices.  The
      <application>Device Manager</application> is located in the
      control panel.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Some versions of &microsoft.windows; have a
	<application>System</application> icon which will display a
	screen where <application>Device Manager</application> may
	be accessed.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If another operating system does not exist on the machine,
      the administrator must find this information out manually.  One
      method is using the &man.dmesg.8; utility and the &man.man.1;
      commands.  Most device drivers on &os; have a manual page, listing
      supported hardware, and during the boot probe, found hardware
      will be listed.  For example, the following lines indicate that
      the <devicename>psm</devicename> driver found a mouse:</para>

    <programlisting>psm0: &lt;PS/2 Mouse&gt; irq 12 on atkbdc0
psm0: [GIANT-LOCKED]
psm0: [ITHREAD]
psm0: model Generic PS/2 mouse, device ID 0</programlisting>

    <para>This driver will need to be included in the custom kernel
      configuration file or loaded using &man.loader.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>On occasion, the data from <command>dmesg</command> will
      only show system messages instead of the boot probe output.  In
      these situations, the output may be obtained by viewing the
      <filename>/var/run/dmesg.boot</filename> file.</para>

    <para>Another method of finding hardware is by using the
      &man.pciconf.8; utility which provides more verbose output.
      For example:</para>

    <programlisting>ath0@pci0:3:0:0:        class=0x020000 card=0x058a1014 chip=0x1014168c rev=0x01 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Atheros Communications Inc.'
    device     = 'AR5212 Atheros AR5212 802.11abg wireless'
    class      = network
    subclass   = ethernet</programlisting>

    <para>This bit of output, obtained using
      <command>pciconf <option>-lv</option></command> shows that the
      <devicename>ath</devicename> driver located a wireless Ethernet
      device.  Using
      <command>man <replaceable>ath</replaceable></command> will return
      the &man.ath.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>The <option>-k</option> flag, when passed to &man.man.1;
      can also be used to provide useful information.  From the
      above, one can issue:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; man -k <replaceable>Atheros</replaceable></screen>

    <para>To get a list of manual pages which contain that particular
      word:</para>

    <programlisting>ath(4)                   - Atheros IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver
ath_hal(4)               - Atheros Hardware Access Layer (HAL)</programlisting>

    <para>Armed with a hardware inventory list, the process of building
      a custom kernel should appear less daunting.</para>

    <title>Kernel Drivers, Subsystems, and Modules</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>drivers / modules / subsystems</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Before building a custom kernel, consider the reasons for
      doing so.  If there is a need for specific hardware support,
      it may already exist as a module.</para>

    <para>Kernel modules exist in the
      <filename class="directory">/boot/kernel</filename> directory
      and may be dynamically loaded into the running kernel using
      &man.kldload.8;.  Most, if not all kernel drivers have a
      specific module and manual page.  For example, the last section
      noted the <devicename>ath</devicename> wireless Ethernet driver.
      This device has the following information in its manual
      page:</para>

    <programlisting>Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in &man.loader.conf.5:

    if_ath_load="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>As instructed, adding the <literal>if_ath_load="YES"</literal>
      line to the <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file will
      enable loading this module dynamically at boot time.</para>

    <para>In some cases; however, there is no associated module.  This
      is mostly true for certain subsystems and very important drivers,
      for instance, the fast file system (<acronym>FFS</acronym>) is a
      required option in the kernel.  As is network support (INET).
      Unfortunately the only way to tell if a driver is required is to
      check for the module itself.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>It is considerably easy to remove built in support for a
        device or option and have a broken kernel.  For example, if
        the &man.ata.4; driver is pulled from the kernel configuration
        file, a system using <acronym>ATA</acronym> disk drivers may
        not boot without the line added to
        <filename>loader.conf</filename>.  When in doubt, check for
        the module and then just leave support in the kernel.</para>

    <note>
      <para>It is required to have the full &os; source tree installed
	to build the kernel.</para>
    </note>

    <para>First, let us take a quick tour of the kernel build directory.
      All directories mentioned will be relative to the main
      <filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory, which is also
      accessible through the path name <filename>/sys</filename>.  There are a
      number of subdirectories here representing different parts of the
      kernel, but the most important for our purposes are
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename>, where you
      will edit your custom kernel configuration, and
      <filename>compile</filename>, which is the staging area where your
      kernel will be built.  <replaceable>arch</replaceable> represents
      one of <filename>i386</filename>,
      <filename>amd64</filename>, <filename>ia64</filename>,
      <filename>powerpc</filename>, <filename>sparc64</filename>, or
      <filename>pc98</filename> (an alternative development branch of PC
      hardware, popular in Japan).  Everything inside a particular
      architecture's directory deals with that architecture only; the rest
      of the code is machine independent code common to all platforms to which
      &os; could potentially be ported.  Notice the logical organization of the
      directory structure, with each supported device, file system, and
      option in its own subdirectory.</para>

    <para>The examples in this chapter assume that you are using the i386
      architecture.  If your system has a different architecture you need
      to change the path names accordingly.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If the directory <filename>/usr/src/</filename> does not
	exist on your system (or if it is empty), then the sources have
	not been installed.  The easiest way to install the full source
	tree is is to run <command>sysinstall</command> as
	<username>root</username>, and then choosing
	<guimenuitem>Configure</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>Distributions</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>src</guimenuitem>, and finally
	<guimenuitem>All</guimenuitem>.  If it does not exist, you should
	also create a symlink to <filename>/usr/src/sys/</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /usr/src/sys/ /sys/</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Next, change to the
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename> directory
      and copy the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file to the
      name you want to give your kernel.  For example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC <replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Traditionally, this name is in all capital letters and, if you
      are maintaining multiple &os; machines with different hardware,
      it is a good idea to name it after your machine's hostname.  We will
      call it <filename><replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></filename> for the
      purpose of this example.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Storing your kernel configuration file directly under
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> can be a bad idea.  If you are
	experiencing problems it can be tempting to just delete
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> and start again.  After doing this,
	it usually only takes a few seconds for
	you to realize that you have deleted your custom kernel
	configuration file.  Also, do not edit <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	directly, as it may get overwritten the next time you
	<link linkend="updating-upgrading">update your source tree</link>, and
	your kernel modifications will be lost.</para>

      <para>You might want to keep your kernel configuration file
	elsewhere, and then create a symbolic link to the file in
	the <filename><replaceable>i386</replaceable></filename>
	directory.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /root/kernels</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput>	
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </tip>

    <para>Now, edit <filename><replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></filename>
      with your favorite text editor.  If you are just starting out, the only
      editor available will probably be <application>vi</application>, which
      is too complex to explain here, but is covered well in many books in
      the <link linkend="bibliography">bibliography</link>.  However, &os; does
      offer an easier editor called <application>ee</application> which, if
      you are a beginner, should be your editor of choice.  Feel free to
      change the comment lines at the top to reflect your configuration or
      the changes you have made to differentiate it from
      <filename>GENERIC</filename>.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>SunOS</primary></indexterm>

    <para>If you have built a kernel under &sunos; or some other BSD
      operating system, much of this file will be very familiar to you.
      If you are coming from some other operating system such as DOS, on
      the other hand, the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file
      might seem overwhelming to you, so follow the descriptions in the
      <link linkend="kernelconfig-config">Configuration File</link>
      section slowly and carefully.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you <link
        linkend="updating-upgrading">sync your source tree</link> with the
        latest sources of the &os; project,
        be sure to always check the file
        <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> before you perform any update
        steps.  This file describes any important issues or areas
        requiring special attention within the updated source code.
        <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> always matches
        your version of the &os; source, and is therefore more up to date
        with new information than this handbook.</para>

      <programlisting>WITHOUT_MODULES = linux acpi sound ntfs</programlisting>

      <para>This variable sets up a list of top level modules to exclude

    <para>The new kernel will be copied to the <filename

	can be placed in <filename class="directory">/boot/kernel</filename>,
	although users should be aware that keeping modules in sync with the

      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>configuration file</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The general format of a configuration file is quite simple.
      Each line contains a keyword and one or more arguments.  For
      simplicity, most lines only contain one argument.  Anything
      following a <literal>#</literal> is considered a comment and
      ignored.  The following sections describe each keyword, in
      the order they are listed in <filename>GENERIC</filename>.
      <anchor
      id="kernelconfig-options"> For an exhaustive list of architecture
      dependent options and devices, see the <filename>NOTES</filename>
      file in the same directory as the <filename>GENERIC</filename> file. For
      architecture independent options, see
      <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename>.</para>

    <para>An <literal>include</literal> directive is
      available for use in configuration files.  This allows another
      configuration file to be logically included in the current one, making
      it easy to maintain small changes relative to an existing file.  For
      example, if you require a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel with
      only a small number of additional options or drivers, this allows you
      to maintain only a delta with respect to GENERIC:</para>

    <programlisting>include GENERIC
ident MYKERNEL

options         IPFIREWALL
options         DUMMYNET
options         IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT
options         IPDIVERT
</programlisting>

    <para>Many administrators will find that this model offers significant
      benefits over the historic writing of configuration files from scratch:
      the local configuration file will express only local differences from
      a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel and as upgrades are performed,
      new features added to <filename>GENERIC</filename> will be added to the
      local kernel unless specifically prevented using
      <literal>nooptions</literal> or <literal>nodevice</literal>.  The
      remainder of this chapter addresses the contents of a typical
      configuration file and the role various options and devices
      play.</para>

    <note>
      <para>To build a file which contains all available options,
	as normally done for testing purposes, run the following
	command as <username>root</username>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>i386</replaceable>/conf &amp;&amp; make LINT</userinput></screen>

    <para>The following is an example of the <filename>GENERIC</filename>
      kernel configuration file with various additional comments where needed

    <para>The above option specifies the type of CPU you have in your

      but for a custom kernel it is best to specify only the CPU
      you have.  If you are unsure of your CPU type, you can check the

    <para>This is the identification of the kernel.  You should change
      this to whatever you named your kernel,
      i.e. <literal><replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></literal> if you have
      followed the instructions of the previous examples.  The value you put
      in the <literal>ident</literal> string will print when you boot up the
      kernel, so it is useful to give the new kernel a different name if you
      want to keep it separate from your usual kernel (e.g., you want to
      build an experimental kernel).</para>

    <programlisting>#To statically compile in device wiring instead of /boot/device.hints
#hints          "GENERIC.hints"         # Default places to look for devices.</programlisting>

    <para>The &man.device.hints.5; is
      used to configure options of the device drivers.  The default
      location that &man.loader.8; will check at boot time is
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.  Using the
      <literal>hints</literal> option you can compile these hints
      statically into your kernel.  Then there is no need to create a
      <filename>device.hints</filename> file in
      <filename>/boot</filename>.</para>

    <!-- XXX: Add a comment here that explains when compiling hints into
      the kernel is a good idea and why. -->

    <programlisting>makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>

    <para>The normal build process of &os; includes

      the <option>-g</option> option, which enables debugging
      information when passed to &man.gcc.1;.</para>

    <programlisting>options          PREEMPTION         # Enable kernel thread preemption</programlisting>

    <para>Allows threads that are in the kernel to be preempted
      by higher priority threads.  It helps with interactivity and
      allows interrupt threads to run sooner rather than waiting.</para>

    <programlisting>options          INET              # InterNETworking</programlisting>

    <para>Networking support.  Leave this in, even if you do not plan to
      be connected to a network.  Most programs require at least loopback
      networking (i.e., making network connections within your PC), so
      this is essentially mandatory.</para>

      boot from the hard disk.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SOFTUPDATES       # Enable FFS Soft Updates support</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel, this will
      help speed up write access on the disks.  Even when this
      functionality is provided by the kernel, it must be turned on
      for specific disks.  Review the output from &man.mount.8; to see
      if Soft Updates is enabled for your system disks.  If you do not
      see the <literal>soft-updates</literal> option then you will
      need to activate it using the &man.tunefs.8; (for existing
      file systems) or &man.newfs.8; (for new file systems)
      commands.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_ACL           # Support for access control lists</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables kernel support
      for access control lists.  This relies on the use of extended
      attributes and <acronym>UFS2</acronym>, and the feature is described
      in detail in <xref linkend="fs-acl">.  <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are
      enabled by default and should not be
      disabled in the kernel if they have been used previously on a file
      system, as this will remove the access control lists, changing the
      way files are protected in unpredictable ways.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_DIRHASH       # Improve performance on big directories</programlisting>

    <para>This option includes functionality to speed up disk
      operations on large directories, at the expense of using
      additional memory.  You would normally keep this for a large
      server, or interactive workstation, and remove it if you are
      using &os; on a smaller system where memory is at a premium and
      disk access speed is less important, such as a firewall.</para>

    <programlisting>options          MD_ROOT           # MD is a potential root device</programlisting>

    <para>The ISO 9660 file system for CDROMs.  Comment it out if you do
      not have a CDROM drive or only mount data CDs occasionally (since it
      will be dynamically loaded the first time you mount a data CD).
      Audio CDs do not need this file system.</para>

      file system mounted on <filename>/proc</filename> which allows
      programs like &man.ps.1; to give you more information on what

      is not required under most circumstances, as most

      act strangely if you comment this out.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD4   # Compatible with &os;4</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required
      to support applications compiled on older versions of &os;
      that use older system call interfaces.  It is recommended that
      this option be used on all &i386; systems that may
      run older applications; platforms that gained support only in
      5.X, such as ia64 and &sparc64;, do not require this option.</para>

      &os;&nbsp;7.X system call interfaces.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SCSI_DELAY=5000  # Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI</programlisting>

    <para>This causes the kernel to pause for 5 seconds before probing
      each SCSI device in your system.  If you only have IDE hard drives,
      you can ignore this, otherwise you can try to lower this
      number, to speed up booting.  Of course, if
      you do this and &os; has trouble recognizing your SCSI devices,
      you will have to raise it again.</para>

    <programlisting>options          KTRACE            # ktrace(1) support</programlisting>

    <para>This enables kernel process tracing, which is useful in
      debugging.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSHM           # SYSV-style shared memory</programlisting>

    <para>This option provides for System&nbsp;V shared memory.  The most
      common use of this is the XSHM extension in X, which many
      graphics-intensive programs will automatically take advantage of for
      extra speed.  If you use X, you will definitely want to include
      this.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVMSG           # SYSV-style message queues</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System&nbsp;V messages.  This option only adds
      a few hundred bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSEM           # SYSV-style semaphores</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System&nbsp;V semaphores.  Less commonly used but only
      adds a few hundred bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <note>

      (such as <application>&staroffice;</application>).</para>

    <programlisting>options          KBD_INSTALL_CDEV  # install a CDEV entry in /dev</programlisting>

      nodes in <filename>/dev</filename>.</para>

    <programlisting>options          ADAPTIVE_GIANT    # Giant mutex is adaptive.</programlisting>

    <para>Giant is the name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a sleep mutex)
      that protects a large set of kernel resources.  Today, this is an
      unacceptable performance bottleneck which is actively being replaced
      with locks that protect individual resources.  The
      <literal>ADAPTIVE_GIANT</literal> option causes Giant to be included
      in the set of mutexes adaptively spun on.  That is, when a thread
      wants to lock the Giant mutex, but it is already locked by a thread
      on another CPU, the first thread will keep running and wait for the
      lock to be released.  Normally, the thread would instead go back to
      sleep and wait for its next chance to run.  If you are not sure,
      leave this in.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Note that on &os; 8.0-RELEASE and later versions, all mutexes are
	adaptive by default, unless explicitly set to non-adaptive by
	compiling with the <literal>NO_ADAPTIVE_MUTEXES</literal> option.  As
	a result, Giant is adaptive by default now, and the
	<literal>ADAPTIVE_GIANT</literal> option has been removed from the
	kernel configuration.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you have an internal modem on <devicename>COM4</devicename>

	to change the IRQ of the modem to 2 (for obscure technical reasons,
	IRQ2 = IRQ 9) in order to access it
	from &os;.  If you have a multiport serial card, check the
	manual page for &man.sio.4; for more information on the proper
	values to add to your <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.
	Some video cards (notably those based on
	S3 chips) use IO addresses in the form of
	<literal>0x*2e8</literal>, and since many cheap serial cards do
	not fully decode the 16-bit IO address space, they clash with
	these cards making the <devicename>COM4</devicename> port
	practically unavailable.</para>

      <para>Each serial port is required to have a unique IRQ (unless you
        are using one of the multiport cards where shared interrupts are
	supported), so the default IRQs for <devicename>COM3</devicename>

	<para>The Physical Address Extension (<acronym>PAE</acronym>)

	  allows memory configurations of up to 64 gigabytes.
	  &os; provides support for this capability via the

	  in all current release versions of &os;.  Due to
	  the limitations of the Intel memory architecture, no distinction

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the &man.config.8; command fails when you

	    &man.config.8; will print the line number that it
	    had trouble with, so that you can quickly locate the line
	    containing the error.  For example, if you see:</para>

	  <screen>config: line 17: syntax error</screen>

	  <para>If the <command>make</command> command fails, it usually

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The kernel does not boot:<anchor
	  id="kernelconfig-noboot"></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If your new kernel does not boot, or fails to
	    recognize your devices, do not panic!  Fortunately, &os; has
	    an excellent mechanism for recovering from incompatible
	    kernels.  Simply choose the kernel you want to boot from at
	    the &os; boot loader. You can access this when the system
	    boot menu appears.  Select the <quote>Escape to a loader
	    prompt</quote> option, number six.  At the prompt, type
	    <command>unload kernel</command>
            and then type
	    <command>boot /boot/<replaceable>kernel.old</replaceable>/kernel</command>,
            or the filename of any other kernel that will boot properly.
            When reconfiguring a kernel, it is always a good idea to keep
            a kernel that is known to work on hand.</para>

	  <para>After booting with a good kernel you can check over your
	    configuration file and try to build it again.  One helpful
	    resource is the <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> file
	    which records, among other things, all of the kernel messages
	    from every successful boot.  Also, the &man.dmesg.8; command
	    will print the kernel messages from the current boot.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are having trouble building a kernel, make sure
	      to keep a <filename>GENERIC</filename>, or some other kernel
	      that is known to work on hand as a different name that will
	      not get erased on the next build.  You cannot rely on
	      <filename>kernel.old</filename> because when installing a
	      new kernel, <filename>kernel.old</filename> is overwritten
	      with the last installed kernel which may be non-functional.
	      Also, as soon as possible, move the working kernel to the
	      proper <filename class="directory">/boot/kernel</filename>
	      location or commands such
	      as &man.ps.1; may not work properly.  To do this, simply
	      rename the directory containing the good kernel:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/kernel <replaceable>/boot/kernel.bad</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/<replaceable>kernel.good</replaceable> /boot/kernel</userinput></screen>

	<term>The kernel works, but &man.ps.1; does not work
	  any more:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you have installed a different version of the kernel
	    from the one that the system utilities have been built with,
	    for example, a -CURRENT kernel on a -RELEASE, many system-status
	    commands like &man.ps.1; and &man.vmstat.8; will not work any
	    more.  You should <link linkend="makeworld">recompile and install
	    a world</link> built with the same version of the source tree as
	    your kernel.  This is one reason it is
	    not normally a good idea to use a different version of the
	    kernel from the rest of the operating system.</para>

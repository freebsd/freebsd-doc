    <para>The kernel is the core of the &os; operating system.  It
      is responsible for managing memory, enforcing security controls,
      networking, disk access, and much more.  While much of &os; is
      dynamically configurable, it is still occasionally necessary to
      configure and compile a custom kernel.</para>

    <title>Why Build a Custom Kernel?</title>

    <para>Traditionally, &os; used a monolithic kernel.  The kernel
      was one large program, supported a fixed list of devices, and in
      order to change the kernel's behavior, one had to compile and
      then reboot into a new kernel.</para>

    <para>Today, most of the functionality in the &os; kernel is
      contained in modules which can be dynamically loaded and
      unloaded from the kernel as necessary.  This allows the running
      kernel to adapt immediately to new hardware and for new
      functionality to be brought into the kernel.  This is known as
      a modular kernel.</para>

    <para>Occasionally, it is still necessary to perform static kernel
      configuration.  Sometimes the needed functionality is so tied
      to the kernel that it can not be made dynamically loadable.
      Some security environments prevent the loading and unloading of
      kernel modules and require that only needed functionality is
      statically compiled into the kernel.</para>

    <para>Building a custom kernel is often a rite of passage for
      advanced BSD users.  This process, while time consuming, can
      provide benefits to the &os; system.  Unlike the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which must support a wide
      range of hardware, a custom kernel can be stripped down to only
      provide support for that computer's hardware.  This has a number
      of benefits, such as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Faster boot time.  Since the kernel will only probe the
	  hardware on the system, the time it takes the system to boot
	  can decrease.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Lower memory usage.  A custom kernel often uses less
	  memory than the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by
	  omitting unused features and device drivers.  This is
	  important because the kernel code remains resident in
	  physical memory at all times, preventing that memory from
	  being used by applications.  For this reason, a custom
	  kernel is useful on a system with a small amount of
	  RAM.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Additional hardware support.  A custom kernel can add
	  support for devices which are not present in the
	  <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Before building a custom kernel, consider the reason for
      doing so.  If there is a need for specific hardware support,
      it may already exist as a module.</para>

    <para>Kernel modules exist in <filename>/boot/kernel</filename>
      and may be dynamically loaded into the running kernel using
      &man.kldload.8;.  Most kernel drivers have a loadable module and
      manual page.  For example, the &man.ath.4; wireless Ethernet
      driver has the following information in its manual page:</para>

    <screen>Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in &man.loader.conf.5;:

    if_ath_load="YES"</screen>

    <para>Adding <literal>if_ath_load="YES"</literal> to
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> will load this module
      dynamically at boot time.</para>

    <para>In some cases, there is no associated module in
      <filename>/boot/kernel</filename>.  This is mostly true for
      certain subsystems.</para>

    <title>Finding the System Hardware</title>

    <para>Before editing the kernel configuration file, it is
      recommended to perform an inventory of the machine's hardware.
      On a dual-boot system, the inventory can be created from the
      other operating system.  For example, &microsoft;'s
      <application>Device Manager</application> contains information
      about installed devices.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Some versions of &microsoft.windows; have a
	<application>System</application> icon which can be used to
	access <application>Device Manager</application>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If &os; is the only installed operating system, use
      &man.dmesg.8; to determine the hardware that was found and
      listed during the boot probe.  Most device drivers on &os; have
      a manual page which lists the hardware supported by that driver.
      For example, the following lines indicate that the &man.psm.4;
      driver found a mouse:</para>

    <screen>psm0: &lt;PS/2 Mouse&gt; irq 12 on atkbdc0
psm0: [GIANT-LOCKED]
psm0: [ITHREAD]
psm0: model Generic PS/2 mouse, device ID 0</screen>

    <para>Since this hardware exists, this driver should not be
      removed from a custom kernel configuration file.</para>

    <para>If the output of <command>dmesg</command> does not display
      the results of the boot probe output, instead read the contents
      of <filename>/var/run/dmesg.boot</filename>.</para>

    <para>Another tool for finding hardware is &man.pciconf.8;, which
      provides more verbose output.  For example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>pciconf -lv</userinput>
ath0@pci0:3:0:0:        class=0x020000 card=0x058a1014 chip=0x1014168c rev=0x01 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Atheros Communications Inc.'
    device     = 'AR5212 Atheros AR5212 802.11abg wireless'
    class      = network
    subclass   = ethernet</screen>

    <para>This output shows that the <filename>ath</filename> driver
      located a wireless Ethernet device.</para>

    <para>The <option>-k</option> flag of &man.man.1; can be used to
      provide useful information.  For example, it can be
      used to display a list of manual pages which contain a
      particular device brand or name:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>man -k <replaceable>Atheros</replaceable></userinput>
ath(4)                   - Atheros IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver
ath_hal(4)               - Atheros Hardware Access Layer (HAL)</screen>

    <para>Once the hardware inventory list is created, refer to it
      to ensure that drivers for installed hardware are not removed
      as the custom kernel configuration is edited.</para>

    <title>The Configuration File</title>

    <para>In order to create a custom kernel configuration file and
      build a custom kernel, the full &os; source tree must first be
      installed.</para>

    <para>If <filename>/usr/src/</filename> does not exist or it is
      empty, source has not been installed.  Source can be installed
      using <application>Subversion</application> and the instructions
      in <xref linkend="svn"/>.</para>

    <para>Once source is installed, review the contents of
      <filename>/usr/src/sys</filename>.  This directory contains a
      number of subdirectories, including those which represent the
      following supported architectures: <filename>amd64</filename>,
      <filename>i386</filename>,
      <filename>powerpc</filename>, and
      <filename>sparc64</filename>.  Everything inside a particular
      architecture's directory deals with that architecture only and
      the rest of the code is machine independent code common to all
      platforms.  Each supported architecture has a
      <filename>conf</filename> subdirectory which contains the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel configuration file for that
      architecture.</para>

    <para>Do not make edits to <filename>GENERIC</filename>.  Instead,
      copy the file to a different name and make edits to the copy.
      The convention is to use a name with all capital letters.  When
      maintaining multiple &os; machines with different hardware, it
      is a good idea to name it after the machine's hostname.  This
      example creates a copy, named <filename>MYKERNEL</filename>, of
      the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file for the
      <literal>amd64</literal> architecture:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>amd64</replaceable>/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC <replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para><filename><replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></filename> can
      now be customized with any <acronym>ASCII</acronym> text editor.
      The default editor is <application>vi</application>, though an
      easier editor for beginners, called
      <application>ee</application>, is also installed with
      &os;.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>NOTES</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>NOTES</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>configuration file</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The format of the kernel configuration file is simple.
      Each line contains a keyword that represents a device or
      subsystem, an argument, and a brief description.  Any text
      after a <literal>#</literal> is considered a comment and
      ignored.  To remove kernel support for a device or subsystem,
      put a <literal>#</literal> at the beginning of the line
      representing that device or subsystem.  Do not add or remove a
      <literal>#</literal> for any line that you do not
      understand.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>It is easy to remove support for a device or option and
	end up with a broken kernel.  For example, if the &man.ata.4;
	driver is removed from the kernel configuration file, a system
	using <acronym>ATA</acronym> disk drivers may not boot.  When
	in doubt, just leave support in the kernel.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>In addition to the brief descriptions provided in this file,
      additional descriptions are contained in
      <filename>NOTES</filename>, which can be found in the same
      directory as <filename>GENERIC</filename> for that architecture.
      For architecture independent options, refer to
      <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>When finished customizing the kernel configuration file,
	save a backup copy to a location outside of
	<filename>/usr/src</filename>.</para>

      <para>Alternately, keep the kernel configuration file elsewhere
	and create a symbolic link to the file:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /root/kernels</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC /root/kernels/MYKERNEL</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /root/kernels/MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>
    </tip>

    <para>An <literal>include</literal> directive is available for use
      in configuration files.  This allows another configuration file
      to be included in the current one, making it easy to maintain
      small changes relative to an existing file.  If only a small
      number of additional options or drivers are required, this
      allows a delta to be maintained with respect to
      <filename>GENERIC</filename>, as seen in this example:</para>

    <programlisting>include GENERIC
ident MYKERNEL

options         IPFIREWALL
options         DUMMYNET
options         IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT
options         IPDIVERT</programlisting>

    <para>Using this method, the local configuration file expresses
      local differences from a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.
      As upgrades are performed, new features added to
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> will also be added to the local
      kernel unless they are specifically prevented using
      <literal>nooptions</literal> or <literal>nodevice</literal>.  A
      comprehensive list of configuration directives and their
      descriptions may be found in &man.config.5;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>To build a file which contains all available options,
	run the following command as <systemitem
	  class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf &amp;&amp; make LINT</userinput></screen>
    </note>

This is outdated and specific to one architecture.

    <programlisting>ident          GENERIC</programlisting>

    <para>This is the identification of the kernel.  Change
      this to the new kernel name, such as
      <literal><replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></literal>.
      The value in the <literal>ident</literal> string will
      print when the kernel boots.</para>

    <para>Networking support.  This is mandatory as most programs
      require at least loopback networking.</para>

    <programlisting>options          INET6             # IPv6 communications protocols</programlisting>

    <para>This enables the IPv6 communication protocols.</para>

    <programlisting>options          FFS               # Berkeley Fast Filesystem</programlisting>

    <para>This is the basic hard drive file system.  Leave it in if
      the system boots from the hard disk.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SOFTUPDATES       # Enable FFS Soft Updates support</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel which helps
      to speed up write access on the disks.  Even when this
      functionality is provided by the kernel, it must be turned on
      for specific disks.  Review the output of &man.mount.8; to
      determine if Soft Updates is enabled.  If the
      <literal>soft-updates</literal> option is not in the output, it
      can be activated using &man.tunefs.8; for existing file systems
      or &man.newfs.8; for new file systems.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_ACL           # Support for access control lists</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables kernel support for access control lists
      (<acronym>ACL</acronym>s).  This relies on the use of extended
      attributes and <acronym>UFS2</acronym>, and the feature is
      described in detail in <xref linkend="fs-acl"/>.
      <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are enabled by default and should not be
      disabled in the kernel if they have been used previously on a
      file system, as this will remove the ACLs, changing the way
      files are protected in unpredictable ways.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_DIRHASH       # Improve performance on big directories</programlisting>

    <para>This option includes functionality to speed up disk
      operations on large directories, at the expense of using
      additional memory.  Keep this for a large server or interactive
      workstation, and remove it from smaller systems where memory is
      at a premium and disk access speed is less important, such as a
      firewall.</para>

    <programlisting>options          MD_ROOT           # MD is a potential root device</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables support for a memory backed virtual disk

    <para>The ISO 9660 file system for CDROMs.  Comment it out if the
      system does not have a CDROM drive or only mounts data CDs
      occasionally since it will be dynamically loaded the first

    <para>The process file system.  This is a <quote>pretend</quote>
      file system mounted on <filename>/proc</filename> which allows
      some programs to provide more information on what processes are
      running.  Use of <literal>PROCFS</literal> is not required under
      most circumstances, as most debugging and monitoring tools have

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD4   # Compatible with &os;4</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required to support applications compiled on
      older versions of &os; that use older system call interfaces.
      It is recommended that this option be used on all &i386; systems
      that may run older applications.  Platforms that gained support
      after &os;&nbsp;4.X, such as &sparc64;, do not require
      this option.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD5   # Compatible with &os;5</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required to support applications compiled on

      interfaces.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD6   # Compatible with &os;6</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required to support applications compiled on

      &os;&nbsp;7.X system call interfaces.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SCSI_DELAY=5000  # Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI</programlisting>

    <para>This causes the kernel to pause for 5 seconds before probing
      each <acronym>SCSI</acronym> device in the system.  If
      <acronym>SCSI</acronym> drives are not recognized, increase the
      number.  If the system does not have any <acronym>SCSI</acronym>
      drives, this value can be ignored or decreased to speed up
      booting.</para>

    <programlisting>options          KTRACE            # ktrace(1) support</programlisting>

    <para>This enables kernel process tracing, which is useful in
      debugging.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSHM           # SYSV-style shared memory</programlisting>

    <para>This option provides for System&nbsp;V shared memory.  The
      most common use of this is the XSHM extension in X, which many
      graphics-intensive programs will automatically take advantage of

	    (<acronym>PAE</acronym>)</primary>
	  <secondary>large memory</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Large memory configuration machines require access to
	more than the 4 gigabyte limit on User+Kernel Virtual
	Address (<acronym>KVA</acronym>) space.  Due to this
	limitation, Intel added support for 36-bit physical address
	space access in the &pentium; Pro and later line of
	CPUs.</para>

      <para>The Physical Address Extension (<acronym>PAE</acronym>)
	capability of the &intel; &pentium; Pro and later CPUs allows
	memory configurations of up to 64 gigabytes.  &os; provides
	support for this capability via the <option>PAE</option>
	kernel configuration option, available in all current release
	versions of &os;.  Due to the limitations of the Intel memory
	architecture, no distinction is made for memory above or below
	4 gigabytes.  Memory allocated above 4 gigabytes is simply
	added to the pool of available memory.</para>

      <para>To enable <acronym>PAE</acronym> support in the kernel,
	add the following line to the kernel configuration
	file:</para>

      <programlisting>options		    PAE</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>The <acronym>PAE</acronym> support in &os; is only
	    available for &intel; IA-32 processors.  It should also be
	    noted that the <acronym>PAE</acronym> support in &os; has
	    not received wide testing, and should be considered beta
	    quality compared to other stable features of &os;.</para>
	</note>

	<para><acronym>PAE</acronym> support in &os; has a few
	  limitations:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A process is not able to access more than 4
	      gigabytes of virtual memory space.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Device drivers that do not use the &man.bus.dma.9;
	      interface will cause data corruption in a
	      <acronym>PAE</acronym> enabled kernel and are not
	      recommended for use.  For this reason, a
	      <filename>PAE</filename> kernel configuration file is
	      provided in &os; which excludes all drivers not known to
	      work in a <acronym>PAE</acronym> enabled kernel.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Some system tunables determine memory resource usage
	      by the amount of available physical memory.  Such
	      tunables can unnecessarily over-allocate due to the
	      large memory nature of a <acronym>PAE</acronym> system.
	      One such example is the
	      <varname>kern.maxvnodes</varname> sysctl, which controls
	      the maximum number of vnodes allowed in the kernel.  It
	      is advised to adjust this and other such tunables to a
	      reasonable value.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>It might be necessary to increase the kernel virtual
	      address (<acronym>KVA</acronym>) space or to reduce the
	      amount of specific kernel resource that is heavily used
	      in order to avoid <acronym>KVA</acronym> exhaustion.
	      The <option>KVA_PAGES</option> kernel option can be used
	      for increasing the <acronym>KVA</acronym> space.</para>

    <title>Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</title>

    <para>Once the edits to the custom configuration file have been
      saved, the source code for the kernel can be compiled using the
      following steps:</para>

    <procedure>
      <title>Building a Kernel</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>kernel</primary>
	<secondary>building / installing</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <step>
	<para>Change to this directory:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Compile the new kernel by specifying the name of the
	  custom kernel configuration file:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildkernel KERNCONF=<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Install the new kernel associated with the specified
	  kernel configuration file.  This command will copy the new
	  kernel to <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename> and save
	  the old kernel to
	  <filename>/boot/kernel.old/kernel</filename>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make installkernel KERNCONF=<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Shutdown the system and reboot into the new kernel.
	  If something goes wrong, refer to <xref
	    linkend="kernelconfig-noboot"/>.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>By default, when a custom kernel is compiled, all kernel
      modules are rebuilt.  To update a kernel faster or to build
      only custom modules, edit <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>
      before starting to build the kernel.</para>

    <para>For example, this variable specifies the list of modules to
      build instead of using the default of building all
      modules:</para>

    <programlisting>MODULES_OVERRIDE = linux acpi</programlisting>

    <para>Alternately, this variable lists which modules to exclude
      from the build process:</para>

    <programlisting>WITHOUT_MODULES = linux acpi sound</programlisting>

    <para>Additional variables are available.  Refer to
      &man.make.conf.5; for details.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="kernelconfig-trouble">
    <title>If Something Goes Wrong</title>

    <para>There are four categories of trouble that can occur when
      building a custom kernel:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>config</command> fails</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If <command>config</command> fails, it will print the
	    line number that is incorrect.  As an example, for the
	    following message, make sure that line 17 is typed
	    correctly by comparing it to <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	    or <filename>NOTES</filename>:</para>

	  <screen>config: line 17: syntax error</screen>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>make</command> fails</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If <command>make</command> fails, it is usually due to
	    an error in the kernel configuration file which is not
	    severe enough for <command>config</command> to catch.
	    Review the configuration, and if the problem is not
	    apparent, send an email to the &a.questions; which
	    contains the kernel configuration file.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry xml:id="kernelconfig-noboot">
	<term>The kernel does not boot</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the new kernel does not boot or fails to recognize
	    devices, do not panic!  Fortunately, &os; has an excellent
	    mechanism for recovering from incompatible kernels.
	    Simply choose the kernel to boot from at the &os; boot
	    loader.  This can be accessed when the system boot menu
	    appears by selecting the <quote>Escape to a loader
	      prompt</quote> option.  At the prompt, type
	    <command>boot
	      <replaceable>kernel.old</replaceable></command>, or the
	    name of any other kernel that is known to boot
	    properly.</para>

	  <para>After booting with a good kernel, check over the
	    configuration file and try to build it again.  One helpful
	    resource is <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> which
	    records the kernel messages from every successful boot.
	    Also, &man.dmesg.8; will print the kernel messages from
	    the current boot.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>When troubleshooting a kernel, make sure to keep
	      a copy of <filename>GENERIC</filename>, or some other
	      kernel that is known to work, as a different name that
	      will not get erased on the next build.  This is
	      important because every time a new kernel is installed,
	      <filename>kernel.old</filename> is overwritten with the
	      last installed kernel, which may or may not be bootable.
	      As soon as possible, move the working kernel by renaming
	      the directory containing the good kernel:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/kernel <replaceable>/boot/kernel.bad</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mv /boot/<replaceable>kernel.good</replaceable> /boot/kernel</userinput></screen>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The kernel works, but &man.ps.1; does not</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the kernel version differs from the one that the
	    system utilities have been built with, for example, a
	    kernel built from -CURRENT sources is installed on a
	    -RELEASE system, many system status commands like
	    &man.ps.1; and &man.vmstat.8; will not work.  To fix this,
	    <link linkend="makeworld">recompile and install a
	      world</link> built with the same version of the source
	    tree as the kernel.  It is never a good idea to use a
	    different version of the kernel than the rest of the
	    operating system.</para>

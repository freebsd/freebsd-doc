    <para><quote>Electronic Mail</quote>, better known as email, is
      one of the most widely used forms of communication today.  This
      chapter provides a basic introduction to running a mail server
      on &os;, as well as an introduction to sending and receiving
      email using &os;.  For more complete coverage of this subject,

    <para>There are five major parts involved in an email exchange:
      the Mail User Agent (<acronym>MUA</acronym>), the Mail Transfer
      Agent (<acronym>MTA</acronym>), a mail host, a remote or local
      mailbox, and <acronym>DNS</acronym>.  This section provides an
      overview of these components.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Mail User Agent (<acronym>MUA</acronym>)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The Mail User Agent (<acronym>MUA</acronym>) is an
	    application which is used to compose, send, and receive
	    emails.  This application can be a command line program,
	    such as the built-in <command>mail</command> utility or a
	    third-party application from the Ports Collection, such as
	    <application>mutt</application>,
	    <application>alpine</application>, or
	    <application>elm</application>.  Dozens of graphical
	    programs are also available in the Ports Collection,
	    including <application>Claws Mail</application>,
	    <application>Evolution</application>, and
	    <application>Thunderbird</application>.  Some
	    organizations provide a web mail program which can be
	    accessed through a web browser.  More information about
	    installing and using a <acronym>MUA</acronym> on &os; can
	    be found in <xref linkend="mail-agents"/>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Mail Transfer Agent (<acronym>MTA</acronym>)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The Mail Transfer Agent (<acronym>MTA</acronym>) is
	    responsible for receiving incoming mail and delivering
	    outgoing mail.  &os; ships with
	    <application>Sendmail</application> as the default
	    <acronym>MTA</acronym>, but it also supports numerous
	    other mail server daemons, including
	    <application>Exim</application>,
	    <application>Postfix</application>, and
	    <application>qmail</application>.
	    <application>Sendmail</application> configuration is
	    described in <xref linkend="sendmail"/>.  If another
	    <acronym>MTA</acronym> is installed using the Ports
	    Collection, refer to its post-installation message for
	    &os;-specific configuration details and the application's
	    website for more general configuration
	    instructions.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Mail Host and Mailboxes</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The mail host is a server that is responsible for
	    delivering and receiving mail for a host or a network.
	    The mail host collects all mail sent to the domain and
	    stores it either in the default <filename>mbox</filename>
	    or the alternative Maildir format, depending on the
	    configuration.  Once mail has been stored, it may either
	    be read locally using a <acronym>MUA</acronym> or remotely
	    accessed and collected using protocols such as
	    <acronym>POP</acronym> or <acronym>IMAP</acronym>.  If
	    mail is read locally, a <acronym>POP</acronym> or
	    <acronym>IMAP</acronym> server does not need to be
	    installed.</para>

	  <para>To access mailboxes remotely, a <acronym>POP</acronym>
	    or <acronym>IMAP</acronym> server is required as these
	    protocols allow users to connect to their mailboxes from
	    remote locations.  <acronym>IMAP</acronym> offers several
	    advantages over <acronym>POP</acronym>.  These include the
	    ability to store a copy of messages on a remote server
	    after they are downloaded and concurrent updates.
	    <acronym>IMAP</acronym> can be useful over low-speed links
	    as it allows users to fetch the structure of messages
	    without downloading them.  It can also perform tasks such
	    as searching on the server in order to minimize data
	    transfer between clients and servers.</para>

	  <para>Several <acronym>POP</acronym> and
	    <acronym>IMAP</acronym> servers are available in the Ports
	    Collection.  These include
	    <package>mail/qpopper</package>,
	    <package>mail/imap-uw</package>,
	    <package>mail/courier-imap</package>, and
	    <package>mail/dovecot2</package>.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>It should be noted that both <acronym>POP</acronym>
	      and <acronym>IMAP</acronym> transmit information,
	      including username and password credentials, in
	      clear-text.  To secure the transmission of information
	      across these protocols, consider tunneling sessions over
	      &man.ssh.1; (<xref linkend="security-ssh-tunneling"/>)
	      or using <acronym>SSL</acronym> (<xref
		linkend="openssl"/>).</para>
	  </warning>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>) and
	    its daemon <command>named</command> play a large role in
	    the delivery of email.  In order to deliver mail from one
	    site to another, the <acronym>MTA</acronym> will look up
	    the remote site in <acronym>DNS</acronym> to determine
	    which host will receive mail for the destination.  This
	    process also occurs when mail is sent from a remote host
	    to the <acronym>MTA</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>In addition to mapping hostnames to
	    <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses, <acronym>DNS</acronym> is
	    responsible for storing information specific to mail
	    delivery, known as Mail eXchanger
	    <acronym>MX</acronym> records.  The <acronym>MX</acronym>
	    record specifies which hosts will receive mail for a
	    particular domain.</para>

	  <para>To view the <acronym>MX</acronym> records for a
	    domain, specify the type of record.   Refer to
	    &man.host.1;, for more details about this command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>host -t mx FreeBSD.org</userinput>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This database file contains a list of virtual

	  <programlisting>root: localuser
ftp-bugs: joe,eric,paul
bit.bucket:  /dev/null
procmail: "|/usr/local/bin/procmail"</programlisting>

	  <para>The mailbox name on the left side of the colon is
	    expanded to the target(s) on the right.  The first entry
	    expands the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
	    mailbox  to the <systemitem
	      class="username">localuser</systemitem> mailbox, which
	    is then looked up in the
	    <filename>/etc/mail/aliases</filename> database.  If no
	    match is found, the message is delivered to <systemitem
	      class="username">localuser</systemitem>.  The second
	    entry shows a mail list.  Mail to <systemitem
	      class="username">ftp-bugs</systemitem> is expanded to
	    the three local mailboxes <systemitem
	      class="username">joe</systemitem>, <systemitem

	  <para>This is the master configuration file for

	    overall behavior of <application>Sendmail</application>,
	    including everything from rewriting email addresses to
	    printing rejection messages to remote mail servers.
	    Accordingly, this configuration file is quite complex.
	    Fortunately, this file rarely needs to be changed for
	    standard mail servers.</para>

	  <para>The master <application>Sendmail</application>
	    configuration file can be built from &man.m4.1; macros
	    that define the features and behavior of

	    <filename>/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README</filename>
	    for some of the details.</para>

	  <para>This database file maps mail addresses for virtual

	    be local, remote, aliases defined in
	    <filename>/etc/mail/aliases</filename>, or files.  This
	    allows multiple virtual domains to be hosted on one
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>&os; provides a sample configuration file in
	    <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable.sample</filename> to
	    further demonstrate its format.  The following example
	    demonstrates how to create custom entries using that
	    format:</para>

	  <programlisting>root@example.com                root
postmaster@example.com          postmaster@noc.example.net
@example.com                    joe</programlisting>

	  <para>This file is processed in a first match order.   When
	    an email address matches the address on the left, it is
	    mapped to the local mailbox listed on the right.  The
	    format of the first entry in this example maps a specific
	    email address to a local mailbox, whereas the format of
	    the second entry maps a specific email address to a remote
	    mailbox.  Finally, any email address from
	    <literal>example.com</literal> which has not matched any
	    of the previous entries will match the last mapping and be
	    sent to the local mailbox <literal>joe</literal>.  When
	    creating custom entries, use this format and add them to
	    <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable</filename>.  Whenever
	    this file is edited, update its database and restart
	    <application>Sendmail</application>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>makemap hash /etc/mail/virtusertable &lt; /etc/mail/virtusertable</userinput>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In a default &os; installation,
	    <application>Sendmail</application> is configured to only
	    send mail from the host it is running on.  For example, if
	    a <acronym>POP</acronym> server is available, users will
	    be able to check mail from remote locations but they will
	    not be able to send outgoing emails from outside
	    locations.  Typically, a few moments after the attempt, an
	    email will be sent from <literal>MAILER-DAEMON</literal>
	    with a <errorname>5.7 Relaying Denied</errorname>
	    message.</para>

	  <para>The most straightforward solution is to add the
	    <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s <acronym>FQDN</acronym> to
	    <filename>/etc/mail/relay-domains</filename>.  If multiple
	    addresses are needed, add them one per
	    line:</para>

	  <programlisting>your.isp.example.com
other.isp.example.net
users-isp.example.org
www.example.org</programlisting>

	<para>After creating or editing this file, restart
	    <application>Sendmail</application> with
	    <command>service sendmail restart</command>.</para>

	  <para>Now any mail sent through the system by any host in
	    this list, provided the user has an account on the system,
	    will succeed.  This allows users to send mail from the

    <para>&os; comes with <application>Sendmail</application> already
      installed as the <acronym>MTA</acronym> which is in charge of
      outgoing and incoming mail.  However, the system administrator
      can change the system's <acronym>MTA</acronym>.  A wide choice
      of alternative <acronym>MTA</acronym>s is available from the
      <literal>mail</literal> category of the &os; Ports
      Collection.</para>

    <para>Once a new <acronym>MTA</acronym> is installed, configure
      and test the new software before replacing
      <application>Sendmail</application>.  Refer to the documentation
      of the new <acronym>MTA</acronym> for information on how to
      configure the software.</para>

    <para>Once the new <acronym>MTA</acronym> is working, use the
      instructions in this section to disable
      <application>Sendmail</application> and configure &os; to use
      the replacement <acronym>MTA</acronym>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mail-disable-sendmail">
      <title>Disable <application>Sendmail</application></title>

      <warning>
	<para>If <application>Sendmail</application>'s outgoing mail
	  service is disabled, it is important that it is replaced
	  with an alternative mail delivery system.  Otherwise, system
	  functions such as &man.periodic.8; will be unable to deliver
	  their results by email.  Many parts of the system expect a
	  functional <acronym>MTA</acronym>.  If applications continue
	  to use <application>Sendmail</application>'s binaries to try
	  to send email after they are disabled, mail could go into an
	  inactive <application>Sendmail</application> queue and
	  never be delivered.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>In order to completely disable
	<application>Sendmail</application>, add or edit the following
	lines in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"</programlisting>

      <para>To only disable <application>Sendmail</application>'s
	incoming mail service, use only this entry in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>sendmail_enable="NO"</programlisting>

      <para>More information on <application>Sendmail</application>'s
	startup options is available in &man.rc.sendmail.8;.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Replace the Default <acronym>MTA</acronym></title>

      <para>When a new <acronym>MTA</acronym> is installed using the
	Ports Collection, its startup script is also installed and
	startup instructions are mentioned in its package message.
	Before starting the new <acronym>MTA</acronym>, stop the
	running <application>Sendmail</application> processes.  This
	example stops all of these services, then starts the
	<application>Postfix</application> service:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service sendmail stop</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>service postfix start</userinput></screen>

      <para>To start the replacement <acronym>MTA</acronym> at system
	boot, add its configuration line to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This entry enables the
	Postfix <acronym>MTA</acronym>:</para>

      <programlisting>postfix_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Some extra configuration is needed as
	<application>Sendmail</application> is so ubiquitous that some
	software assumes it is already installed and configured.
	Check <filename>/etc/periodic.conf</filename> and make sure
	that these values are set to <literal>NO</literal>.  If this
	file does not exist, create it with these entries:</para>

      <programlisting>daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"</programlisting>

      <para>Some alternative <acronym>MTA</acronym>s provide their own
	compatible implementations of the
	<application>Sendmail</application> command-line interface in
	order to facilitate using them as drop-in replacements for
	<application>Sendmail</application>.  However, some
	<acronym>MUA</acronym>s may try to execute standard
	<application>Sendmail</application> binaries instead of the
	new <acronym>MTA</acronym>'s binaries.  &os; uses
	<filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename> to map the expected
	<application>Sendmail</application> binaries to the location
	of the new binaries.  More information about this mapping can
	be found in &man.mailwrapper.8;.</para>

      <para>The default <filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename>
	looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting># $FreeBSD$
#
# Execute the "real" sendmail program, named /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
#
sendmail        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
send-mail       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq           /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases      /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
hoststat        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
purgestat       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail</programlisting>

      <para>When any of the commands listed on the left are run, the
	system actually executes the associated command shown on the
	right.  This system makes it easy to change what binaries are
	executed when these default binaries are invoked.</para>

      <para>Some <acronym>MTA</acronym>s, when installed using the
	Ports Collection, will prompt to update this file for the new
	binaries.  For example, <application>Postfix</application>
	will update the file like this:</para>

      <programlisting>#
# Execute the Postfix sendmail program, named /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
#
sendmail        /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
send-mail       /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq           /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
newaliases      /usr/local/sbin/sendmail</programlisting>

      <para>If the installation of the <acronym>MTA</acronym> does
	not automatically update
	<filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename>, edit this file in
	a text editor so that it points to the new binaries.  This
	example points to the binaries installed by
	<package>mail/ssmtp</package>:</para>

      <programlisting>sendmail        /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
send-mail       /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
mailq           /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases      /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
hoststat        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
purgestat       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail</programlisting>

      <para>Once everything is configured, it is recommended to reboot
	the system.  Rebooting provides the opportunity to ensure that
	the system is correctly configured to start the new
	<acronym>MTA</acronym> automatically on boot.</para>

	<question>
	  <para>Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my
	    site?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The host may actually be in a different domain.  For
	    example, in order for a host in <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">foo.bar.edu</systemitem> to reach a
	    host called <systemitem>mumble</systemitem> in the
	    <systemitem class="fqdomainname">bar.edu</systemitem>
	    domain, refer to it by the Fully-Qualified Domain Name
	    <acronym>FQDN</acronym>, <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">mumble.bar.edu</systemitem>,
	    instead of just <systemitem>mumble</systemitem>.</para>

	  <para>This is because the version of
	    <application>BIND</application><indexterm>
	    <primary>BIND</primary></indexterm> which ships with &os;
	    no longer provides default abbreviations for non-FQDNs
	    other than the local domain.  An unqualified host such as
	    <systemitem>mumble</systemitem> must either be found as
	    <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">mumble.foo.bar.edu</systemitem>, or
	    it will be searched for in the root domain.</para>

	  <para>In older versions of <application>BIND</application>,
	    the search continued across <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">mumble.bar.edu</systemitem>, and
	    <systemitem class="fqdomainname">mumble.edu</systemitem>.
	    RFC 1535 details why this is considered bad practice or
	    even a security hole.</para>

	  <para>As a good workaround, place the line:</para>

	  <programlisting>search foo.bar.edu bar.edu</programlisting>

	  <para>instead of the previous:</para>

	  <programlisting>domain foo.bar.edu</programlisting>

	  <para>into <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  However,
	    make sure that the search order does not go beyond the
	    <quote>boundary between local and public
	      administration</quote>, as RFC 1535 calls it.</para>
	</answer>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>How can I run a mail server on a dial-up PPP
	  host?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Connect to a &os; mail gateway on the LAN.  The PPP
	  connection is non-dedicated.</para>

	<para>One way to do this is to get a full-time Internet server
	  to provide secondary <acronym>MX</acronym><indexterm>
	  <primary>MX record</primary></indexterm> services for the
	  domain.  In this example, the domain is <systemitem
	    class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem> and the ISP
	  has configured <systemitem
	    class="fqdomainname">example.net</systemitem> to provide
	  secondary <acronym>MX</acronym> services to the
	  domain:</para>

	<programlisting>example.com.          MX        10      example.com.
                      MX        20      example.net.</programlisting>

	<para>Only one host should be specified as the final
	  recipient.  For <application>Sendmail</application>, add
	  <literal>Cw example.com</literal> in
	  <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename> on <systemitem
	    class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem>.</para>

	<para>When the sending <acronym>MTA</acronym> attempts
	  to deliver mail, it will try to connect to the system,
	  <systemitem class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem>,
	  over the PPP link.  This will time out if the destination is
	  offline.  The <acronym>MTA</acronym> will automatically
	  deliver it to the secondary <acronym>MX</acronym> site at
	  the Internet Service Provider (<acronym>ISP</acronym>),
	  <systemitem class="fqdomainname">example.net</systemitem>.
	  The secondary <acronym>MX</acronym> site will periodically
	  try to connect to the primary <acronym>MX</acronym> host,
	  <systemitem
	    class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem>.</para>

	<para>Use something like this as a login script:</para>

	<programlisting>#!/bin/sh
# Put me in /usr/local/bin/pppmyisp
( sleep 60 ; /usr/sbin/sendmail -q ) &amp;
/usr/sbin/ppp -direct pppmyisp</programlisting>

	<para>When creating a separate login script for users, instead
	  use <command>sendmail -qRexample.com</command> in the script
	  above.  This will force all mail in the queue for
	  <systemitem class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem> to
	  be processed immediately.</para>

	<para>A further refinement of the situation can be seen from
	  this example from the &a.isp;:</para>

	<programlisting>&gt; we provide the secondary MX for a customer. The customer connects to
&gt; our services several times a day automatically to get the mails to
&gt; his primary MX (We do not call his site when a mail for his domains
&gt; arrived). Our sendmail sends the mailqueue every 30 minutes. At the
&gt; moment he has to stay 30 minutes online to be sure that all mail is
&gt; gone to the primary MX.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a command that would initiate sendmail to send all the mails
&gt; now? The user has not root-privileges on our machine of course.

In the <quote>privacy flags</quote> section of sendmail.cf, there is a
definition Opgoaway,restrictqrun

Remove restrictqrun to allow non-root users to start the queue processing.
You might also like to rearrange the MXs. We are the 1st MX for our
customers like this, and we have defined:

# If we are the best MX for a host, try directly instead of generating
# local config error.
OwTrue

That way a remote site will deliver straight to you, without trying
the customer connection.  You then send to your customer.  Only works for
<quote>hosts</quote>, so you need to get your customer to name their mail
machine <quote>customer.com</quote> as well as
<quote>hostname.customer.com</quote> in the DNS.  Just put an A record in
the DNS for <quote>customer.com</quote>.</programlisting>

      <indexterm><primary>SMTP</primary></indexterm>
      <para>In order to have mail delivered directly to a host, it

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hostname</userinput>
example.FreeBSD.org
&prompt.root; <userinput>host example.FreeBSD.org</userinput>

      <para>In this example, mail sent directly to <email
	  role="nolink">yourlogin@example.FreeBSD.org</email> should
	work without problems, assuming
	<application>Sendmail</application> is running correctly on

	  class="fqdomainname">example.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>.</para>

      <para>For this example:</para>

      <para>The above information is handled by the
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> server.  The <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	record that carries mail routing information is the

      <para><systemitem>freefall</systemitem> had many

	directly, if available.  If it is not accessible for some
	reason, the next lower-numbered host will accept messages
	temporarily, and pass it along when a lower-numbered host

    <title>Using Mail with a Dialup Connection</title>

    <para>When using a static IP address, one should not need to
      adjust the default configuration.  Set the hostname to the
      assigned Internet name and <application>Sendmail</application>
      will do the rest.</para>

    <para>When using a dynamically assigned IP address and a dialup
      PPP connection to the Internet, one usually has a mailbox on the
      <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s mail server.  In this example, the
      <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s domain is <systemitem
	class="fqdomainname">example.net</systemitem>, the user name
      is <systemitem class="username">user</systemitem>, the hostname
      is <systemitem class="fqdomainname">bsd.home</systemitem>, and
      the <acronym>ISP</acronym> has allowed <systemitem
	class="fqdomainname">relay.example.net</systemitem> as a mail
      relay.</para>

    <para>In order to retrieve mail from the <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s
      mailbox, install a retrieval agent from the Ports Collection.
      <package>mail/fetchmail</package> is a good choice as it
      supports many different protocols.  Usually, the
      <acronym>ISP</acronym> will provide <acronym>POP</acronym>.
      When using user <acronym>PPP</acronym>, email can be
      automatically fetched when an Internet connection is established
      with the following entry in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>MYADDR:
!bg su user -c fetchmail</programlisting>

    <para>When using <application>Sendmail</application> to deliver
      mail to non-local accounts, configure
      <application>Sendmail</application> to process the mail queue as
      soon as the Internet connection is established.  To do this, add
      this line after the above <command>fetchmail</command> entry in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>  !bg su user -c "sendmail -q"</programlisting>

    <para>In this example, there is an account for
      <systemitem class="username">user</systemitem> on <systemitem
	class="fqdomainname">bsd.home</systemitem>.  In the home
      directory of <systemitem class="username">user</systemitem> on
      <systemitem class="fqdomainname">bsd.home</systemitem>, create a
      <filename>.fetchmailrc</filename> which contains this
      line:</para>

    <programlisting>poll example.net protocol pop3 fetchall pass MySecret</programlisting>

    <para>This file should not be readable by anyone except
      <systemitem class="username">user</systemitem> as it contains
      the password <literal>MySecret</literal>.</para>

    <para>In order to send mail with the correct
      <literal>from:</literal> header, configure
      <application>Sendmail</application> to use
      <email>user@example.net</email> rather than <email
	role="nolink">user@bsd.home</email> and to send all mail via
      <systemitem class="fqdomainname">relay.example.net</systemitem>,
      allowing quicker mail transmission.</para>

    <para>The following <filename>.mc</filename> should
      suffice:</para>

    <programlisting>VERSIONID(`bsd.home.mc version 1.0')
OSTYPE(bsd4.4)dnl
FEATURE(nouucp)dnl
MAILER(local)dnl
MAILER(smtp)dnl

    <para>Configuring <acronym>SMTP</acronym> authentication on the
      <acronym>MTA</acronym> provides a number of benefits.
      <acronym>SMTP</acronym> authentication adds a layer
      of security to <application>Sendmail</application>, and provides
      mobile users who switch hosts the ability to use the same
      <acronym>MTA</acronym> without the need to reconfigure their
      mail client's settings each time.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Install <package>security/cyrus-sasl2</package>
	  from the Ports Collection.  This port supports a number of
	  compile-time options.  For the SMTP authentication method
	  demonstrated in this example, make sure that
	  <option>LOGIN</option> is not disabled.</para>
      </step>


      <step>
	<para>After installing
	  <package>security/cyrus-sasl2</package>, edit
	  <filename>/usr/local/lib/sasl2/Sendmail.conf</filename>,
	  or create it if it does not exist, and add the following
	  line:</para>

	<programlisting>pwcheck_method: saslauthd</programlisting>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Next, install
	  <package>security/cyrus-sasl2-saslauthd</package> and add
	  the following line to
	  <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>saslauthd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

	<para>Finally, start the saslauthd daemon:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service saslauthd start</userinput></screen>

	<para>This daemon serves as a broker for
	  <application>Sendmail</application> to authenticate against
	  the &os; &man.passwd.5; database.  This saves the trouble of
	  creating a new set of usernames and passwords for each user
	  that needs to use <acronym>SMTP</acronym> authentication,
	  and keeps the login and mail password the same.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Next, edit <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> and add
	  the following lines:</para>

	<programlisting>SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/sasl -DSASL
SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl2</programlisting>

	<para>These lines provide <application>Sendmail</application>
	  the proper configuration options for linking to
	  <package>cyrus-sasl2</package> at compile time.  Make sure
	  that <package>cyrus-sasl2</package> has been installed
	  before recompiling
	  <application>Sendmail</application>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Recompile <application>Sendmail</application> by
	  executing the following commands:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/lib/libsmutil</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make cleandir &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/lib/libsm</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make cleandir &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make</userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>make cleandir &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</userinput></screen>

	<para>This compile should not have any problems if
	  <filename>/usr/src</filename> has not changed extensively
	  and the shared libraries it needs are available.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>After <application>Sendmail</application> has been
	  compiled and reinstalled, edit
	  <filename>/etc/mail/freebsd.mc</filename> or the local
	  <filename>.mc</filename>.  Many administrators choose
	  to use the output from &man.hostname.1; as the name of
	  <filename>.mc</filename> for uniqueness.  Add these
	  lines:</para>

	<programlisting>dnl set SASL options
TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl
define(`confAUTH_MECHANISMS', `GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl</programlisting>

	<para>These options configure the different methods available
	  to <application>Sendmail</application> for authenticating
	  users.  To use a method other than
	  <application>pwcheck</application>, refer to the
	  <application>Sendmail</application> documentation.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Finally, run &man.make.1; while in
	  <filename>/etc/mail</filename>.  That will run the new
	  <filename>.mc</filename> and create a
	  <filename>.cf</filename> named either
	  <filename>freebsd.cf</filename> or the name used for the
	  local <filename>.mc</filename>.  Then, run <command>make
	    install restart</command>, which will copy the file to
	  <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>, and properly restart
	  <application>Sendmail</application>.  For more information
	  about this process, refer to
	  <filename>/etc/mail/Makefile</filename>.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>To test the configuration, use a <acronym>MUA</acronym> to
      send a test message.  For further investigation, set the
      <option>LogLevel</option> of <application>Sendmail</application>
      to <literal>13</literal> and watch

    <para>A <acronym>MUA</acronym> is an application that is used to
      send and receive email.  As email <quote>evolves</quote> and
      becomes more complex, <acronym>MUA</acronym>s are becoming
      increasingly powerful and provide users increased functionality
      and flexibility.  The <literal>mail</literal> category of the
      &os; Ports Collection contains numerous <acronym>MUA</acronym>s.
      These include graphical email clients such as
      <application>Evolution</application> or
      <application>Balsa</application> and console based clients such
      as <application>mutt</application> or
      <application>alpine</application>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mail-command">
      <title><command>mail</command></title>

      <para>&man.mail.1; is the default
	<acronym>MUA</acronym> installed with &os;.  It is a console
	based <acronym>MUA</acronym> that offers the basic
	functionality required to send and receive text-based email.
	It provides limited attachment support and can only access
	local mailboxes.</para>

      <para>Although <command>mail</command> does not natively support
	interaction with <acronym>POP</acronym> or
	<acronym>IMAP</acronym> servers, these mailboxes may be
	downloaded to a local <filename>mbox</filename> using an
	application such as
	<application>fetchmail</application>.</para>

      <para>In order to send and receive email, run
	<command>mail</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mail</userinput></screen>

      <para>The contents of the user's mailbox in
	<filename>/var/mail</filename> are automatically read by
	<command>mail</command>.  Should the mailbox be empty, the
	utility exits with a message indicating that no mail could
	be found.  If mail exists, the application interface starts,
	and a list of messages will be displayed.  Messages are
	automatically numbered, as can be seen in the following
	example:</para>

      <screen>Mail version 8.1 6/6/93.  Type ? for help.
"/var/mail/marcs": 3 messages 3 new
&gt;N  1 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/510   "test"
 N  2 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/509   "user account"
 N  3 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/509   "sample"</screen>

      <para>Messages can now be read by typing <keycap>t</keycap>
	followed by the message number.  This example reads the first
	email:</para>

      <screen>&amp; <userinput>t 1</userinput>
Message 1:
From root@localhost  Mon Mar  8 14:05:52 2004
X-Original-To: marcs@localhost
Delivered-To: marcs@localhost
To: marcs@localhost
Subject: test
Date: Mon,  8 Mar 2004 14:05:52 +0200 (SAST)
From: root@localhost (Charlie Root)

This is a test message, please reply if you receive it.</screen>

      <para>As seen in this example, the message will be displayed
	with full headers.  To display the list of messages again,
	press <keycap>h</keycap>.</para>

      <para>If the email requires a reply, press either
	<keycap>R</keycap> or <keycap>r</keycap>
	<command>mail</command> keys.  <keycap>R</keycap> instructs
	<command>mail</command> to reply only to the sender of the
	email, while <keycap>r</keycap> replies to all other
	recipients of the message.  These commands can be suffixed
	with the mail number of the message to reply to.  After typing
	the response, the end of the message should be marked by a
	single <keycap>.</keycap> on its own line.  An example can be
	seen below:</para>

      <screen>&amp; <userinput>R 1</userinput>
To: root@localhost
Subject: Re: test

<userinput>Thank you, I did get your email.
.</userinput>
EOT</screen>

      <para>In order to send a new email, press <keycap>m</keycap>,
	followed by the recipient email address.  Multiple recipients
	may be specified by separating each address with the
	<keycap>,</keycap> delimiter.  The subject of the message may
	then be entered, followed by the message contents.  The end of
	the message should be specified by putting a single
	<keycap>.</keycap> on its own line.</para>

      <screen>&amp; <userinput>mail root@localhost</userinput>
Subject: <userinput>I mastered mail

Now I can send and receive email using mail ... :)
.</userinput>
EOT</screen>

      <para>While using <command>mail</command>, press
	<keycap>?</keycap> to display help at any time.  Refer to
	&man.mail.1; for more help on how to use
	<command>mail</command>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>&man.mail.1; was not designed to handle attachments and
	  thus deals with them poorly.  Newer <acronym>MUA</acronym>s
	  handle attachments in a more intelligent way.  Users who

    <para>This section explains some of the basic features of
      <application>fetchmail</application>.  This utility requires a
      <filename>.fetchmailrc</filename> configuration in the user's
      home directory in order to run correctly.  This file includes
      server information as well as login credentials.  Due to the
      sensitive nature of the contents of this file, it is advisable
      to make it readable only by the user, with the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod 600 .fetchmailrc</userinput></screen>

    <para>The following <filename>.fetchmailrc</filename> serves as an
      example for downloading a single user mailbox using
      <acronym>POP</acronym>.  It tells
      <application>fetchmail</application> to connect to <systemitem
	 class="fqdomainname">example.com</systemitem> using a
      username of <systemitem class="username">joesoap</systemitem>
      and a password of <literal>XXX</literal>.  This example assumes
      that the user <systemitem class="username">joesoap</systemitem>
      exists on the local system.</para>

    <programlisting>poll example.com protocol pop3 username "joesoap" password "XXX"</programlisting>

    <para>The next example connects to multiple <acronym>POP</acronym>
      and <acronym>IMAP</acronym> servers and redirects to different
      local usernames where applicable:</para>

    <programlisting>poll example.com proto pop3:
user "joesoap", with password "XXX", is "jsoap" here;
user "andrea", with password "XXXX";
poll example2.net proto imap:
user "john", with password "XXXXX", is "myth" here;</programlisting>

    <para><application>fetchmail</application> can be run in daemon
      mode by running it with <option>-d</option>, followed by the
      interval (in seconds) that <application>fetchmail</application>
      should poll servers listed in <filename>.fetchmailrc</filename>.
      The following example configures
      <application>fetchmail</application> to poll every 600
      seconds:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>fetchmail -d 600</userinput></screen>

    <para><application>procmail</application> is a powerful
      application used to filter incoming mail.  It allows users to
      define <quote>rules</quote> which can be matched to incoming
      mails to perform specific functions or to reroute mail to
      alternative mailboxes or email addresses.
      <application>procmail</application> can be installed using the
      <package>mail/procmail</package> port.  Once installed, it can
      be directly integrated into most <acronym>MTA</acronym>s.
      Consult the <acronym>MTA</acronym> documentation for more
      information.  Alternatively, <application>procmail</application>
      can be integrated by adding the following line to a
      <filename>.forward</filename> in the home directory of the
      user:</para>

    <programlisting>"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail || exit 75"</programlisting>

    <para>The following section displays some basic
      <application>procmail</application> rules, as well as brief
      descriptions of what they do.  Rules must be inserted into a
      <filename>.procmailrc</filename>, which must reside in the
      user's home directory.</para>

    <para>The majority of these rules can be found in
      &man.procmailex.5;.</para>

    <para>To forward all mail from <email>user@example.com</email> to

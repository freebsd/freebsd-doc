    <para><quote>Electronic Mail</quote>, better known as email, is one of the
      most widely used forms of communication today.  This chapter provides
      a basic introduction to running a mail server on FreeBSD.
      However, it is not a complete reference and in fact many
      important considerations are omitted.  For more complete
      coverage of the subject, the reader is referred to the many
      excellent books listed in <xref linkend="bibliography">.</para>

      <para>The server daemon usually has two functions&mdash;it looks
        after receiving incoming mail and delivers outgoing mail.  It does
	not allow you to connect to it via POP or IMAP to read your mail.
	You need an additional <link linkend="mail-receive">daemon</link>
	for that.</para>

      <para>Be aware that some older versions of
        <application>sendmail</application> have some serious security
	problems, however as long as you run a current version of it you
	should not have any problems.  As always, it is a good idea to

      <title>Email and DNS</title>

      <para>The Domain Name System (DNS) and its daemon
        <command>named</command> play a large role in the delivery of
	email.  In order to deliver mail from your site to another, the
	server daemon will look up the site in the DNS to determine the
	host that will receive mail for the destination.</para>

      <para>It works the same way when you have mail sent to you.  The DNS
        contains the database mapping hostname to an IP address, and a
	hostname to mailhost.  The IP address is specified in an A record.
	The MX (Mail eXchanger) record specifies the mailhost that will
	receive mail for you.  If you do not have an MX record for your
	hostname, the mail will be delivered directly to your host.</para>

	In order to pick the stored mail up, you will need to connect to

    <para>&man.sendmail.8; is the default Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) in

      mail from Mail User Agents (MUA) and deliver it to the
      appropriate mailer as defined by its configuration file.

    <para>The access database defines what host(s) or IP addresses
      have access to the local mail server and what kind of access
      they have.  Hosts can be listed as <option>OK</option>,
      <option>REJECT</option>, <option>RELAY</option> or simply passed
      to <application>sendmail</application>'s error handling routine with a given mailer error.
      Hosts that are listed as <option>OK</option>, which is the
      default, are allowed to send mail to this host as long as the
      mail's final destination is the local machine.  Hosts that are
      listed as <option>REJECT</option> are rejected for all mail
      connections.  Hosts that have the <option>RELAY</option> option
      for their hostname are allowed to send mail for any destination
      through this mail server.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Configuring the <application>sendmail</application>
  	  Access Database</title>

    <programlisting>cyberspammer.com                550 We don't accept mail from spammers
FREE.STEALTH.MAILER@            550 We don't accept mail from spammers
another.source.of.spam          REJECT
okay.cyberspammer.com           OK
128.32                          RELAY</programlisting>
      </example>

   <para>In this example we have five entries.  Mail senders that
     match the left hand side of the table are affected by the action
     on the right side of the table.  The first two examples give an
     error code to <application>sendmail</application>'s error
     handling routine.  The message is printed to the remote host when
     a mail matches the left hand side of the table.  The next entry
     rejects mail from a specific host on the Internet,
     <hostid>another.source.of.spam</hostid>.  The next entry accepts
     mail connections from a host
     <hostid role="fqdn">okay.cyberspammer.com</hostid>, which is more exact than
     the <hostid role="domainname">cyberspammer.com</hostid> line above.  More specific
     matches override less exact matches.  The last entry allows
     relaying of electronic mail from hosts with an IP address that
     begins with <hostid>128.32</hostid>.  These hosts would be able
     to send mail through this mail server that are destined for other
     mail servers.</para>

   <para>When this file is updated, you need to run
     <command>make</command> in <filename>/etc/mail/</filename> to
     update the database.</para>

   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title><filename>/etc/mail/aliases</filename></title>

    <para>The aliases database contains a list of virtual mailboxes
      that are expanded to other user(s), files, programs or other
      aliases.  Here are a few examples that can be used in
      <filename>/etc/mail/aliases</filename>:</para>

      <example>
	<title>Mail Aliases</title>
    <programlisting>root: localuser
ftp-bugs: joe,eric,paul
bit.bucket:  /dev/null
procmail: "|/usr/local/bin/procmail"</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The file format is simple; the mailbox name on the left
	side of	the colon is expanded to the target(s) on the right.
	The
	first example simply expands the mailbox <username>root</username>
	to the mailbox <username>localuser</username>, which is then
	looked up again in the aliases database.  If no match is found,
	then the message is delivered to the local user
	<username>localuser</username>.  The next example shows a mail
	list.  Mail to the mailbox <username>ftp-bugs</username> is
	expanded to the three local mailboxes <username>joe</username>,
	<username>eric</username>, and <username>paul</username>.  Note
	that a remote mailbox could be specified as <literal>user@example.com</literal>.  The
	next example shows writing mail to a file, in this case
	<filename>/dev/null</filename>.  The last example shows sending
	mail to a program, in this case the mail message is written to the
	standard input of <filename>/usr/local/bin/procmail</filename>
	through a &unix; pipe.</para>

   <para>When this file is updated, you need to run
   <command>make</command> in <filename>/etc/mail/</filename> to
   update the database.</para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title><filename>/etc/mail/local-host-names</filename></title>

    <para>This is a list of hostnames &man.sendmail.8; is to accept as
      the local host name.  Place any domains or hosts that
      <application>sendmail</application> is to be receiving mail for.
      For example, if this mail server was to accept mail for the
      domain <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid> and the host
      <hostid role="fqdn">mail.example.com</hostid>, its
      <filename>local-host-names</filename> might look something like
      this:</para>

    <programlisting>example.com
mail.example.com</programlisting>

    <para>When this file is updated, &man.sendmail.8; needs to be
    restarted to read the changes.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title><filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename></title>

    <para><application>sendmail</application>'s master configuration
      file, <filename>sendmail.cf</filename> controls the overall
      behavior of <application>sendmail</application>, including everything
      from rewriting e-mail addresses to printing rejection messages to
      remote mail servers.  Naturally, with such a diverse role, this
      configuration file is quite complex and its details are a bit
      out of the scope of this section.  Fortunately, this file rarely
      needs to be changed for standard mail servers.</para>

    <para>The master <application>sendmail</application> configuration
      file can be built from &man.m4.1; macros that define the features
      and behavior of <application>sendmail</application>.  Please see
      <filename>/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README</filename> for
      some of the details.</para>

    <para>When changes to this file are made,
      <application>sendmail</application> needs to be restarted for
      the changes to take effect.</para>

  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title><filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable</filename></title>

    <para>The <filename>virtusertable</filename> maps mail addresses for
      virtual domains and
      mailboxes to real mailboxes.  These mailboxes can be local,
      remote, aliases defined in
      <filename>/etc/mail/aliases</filename> or files.</para>

    <example>
	<title>Example Virtual Domain Mail Map</title>

    <programlisting>root@example.com                root
postmaster@example.com          postmaster@noc.example.net
@example.com                    joe</programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>In the above example, we have a mapping for a domain
      <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid>.  This file is processed in a
      first match order down the file.  The first item maps
      <literal>root@example.com</literal> to the local mailbox <username>root</username>.  The next entry maps
      <literal>postmaster@example.com</literal> to the mailbox <username>postmaster</username> on the host
      <hostid role="fqdn">noc.example.net</hostid>.  Finally, if nothing from <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid> has
      matched so far, it will match the last mapping, which matches
      every other mail message addressed to someone at
      <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid>.
      This will be mapped to the local mailbox <username>joe</username>.</para>

    <title>Changing Your Mail Transfer Agent</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>email</primary>
      <secondary>change mta</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>As already mentioned, FreeBSD comes with
      <application>sendmail</application> already installed as your
      MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).  Therefore by default it is
      in charge of your outgoing and incoming mail.</para>

    <para>However, for a variety of reasons, some system
      administrators want to change their system's MTA.  These
      reasons range from simply wanting to try out another MTA to
      needing a specific feature or package which relies on another
      mailer.  Fortunately, whatever the reason, FreeBSD makes it
      easy to make the change.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Install a New MTA</title>

      <para>You have a wide choice of MTAs available.  A good
	starting point is the
	<link linkend="ports">FreeBSD Ports Collection</link> where
	you will be able to find many.  Of course you are free to use
	any MTA you want from any location, as long as you can make
	it run under FreeBSD.</para>

      <para>Start by installing your new MTA.  Once it is installed
	it gives you a chance to decide if it really fulfills your
	needs, and also gives you the opportunity to configure your
	new software before getting it to take over from
	<application>sendmail</application>.  When doing this, you
	should be sure that installing the new software will not attempt
	to overwrite system binaries such as
	<filename>/usr/bin/sendmail</filename>.  Otherwise, your new
	mail software has essentially been put into service before
	you have configured it.</para>

      <para>Please refer to your chosen MTA's documentation for
	information on how to configure the software you have
	chosen.</para>

      <title>Disable <application>sendmail</application></title>

      <para>The procedure used to start
	<application>sendmail</application> changed significantly
	between 4.5-RELEASE and 4.6-RELEASE.  Therefore, the procedure
	used to disable it is subtly different.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>FreeBSD 4.5-STABLE before 2002/4/4 and Earlier
	  (Including 4.5-RELEASE and Earlier)</title>

	<para>Enter:</para>

	  <programlisting>sendmail_enable="NO"</programlisting>

	  <para>into <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This will disable
	  <application>sendmail</application>'s incoming mail service,
	  but if <filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename> (see below)
	  is not changed, <application>sendmail</application> will
	  still be used to send e-mail.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>FreeBSD 4.5-STABLE after 2002/4/4
	  (Including 4.6-RELEASE and Later)</title>

	<para>In order to completely disable
	  <application>sendmail</application> you must use</para>

	  <programlisting>sendmail_enable="NONE"</programlisting>

	  <para>in <filename>/etc/rc.conf.</filename></para>

	<warning>
	  <para>If you disable <application>sendmail</application>'s
	    outgoing mail service in this way, it is important that you
	    replace it with a fully working alternative mail delivery
	    system.  If you choose not to, system functions such as

      <title>Replacing <application>sendmail</application> as
       the System's Default Mailer</title>

      <para>The program <application>sendmail</application> is so ubiquitous
	as standard software on &unix; systems that some software
	just assumes it is already installed and configured.
	For this reason, many alternative MTA's provide their own compatible
	implementations of the <application>sendmail</application>
	command-line interface; this facilitates using them as
	<quote>drop-in</quote> replacements for <application>sendmail</application>.</para>

      <para>Therefore, if you are using an alternative mailer,
	you will need to make sure that software trying to execute
	standard <application>sendmail</application> binaries such as
	<filename>/usr/bin/sendmail</filename> actually executes
	your chosen mailer instead.  Fortunately, FreeBSD provides
	a system called &man.mailwrapper.8; that does this job for
	you.</para>

      <para>When <application>sendmail</application> is operating as installed, you will
	find something like the following
	in <filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename>:</para>

<programlisting>sendmail	 /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
send-mail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq		/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
hoststat	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
purgestat	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail</programlisting>

      <para>This means that when any of these common commands
	(such as <filename>sendmail</filename> itself) are run,
	the system actually invokes a copy of mailwrapper named <filename>sendmail</filename>, which
	checks <filename>mailer.conf</filename> and
	executes <filename>/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail</filename>
	instead.  This system makes it easy to change what binaries
	are actually executed when these default <filename>sendmail</filename> functions
	are invoked.</para>

      <para>Therefore if you wanted
	<filename>/usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat</filename>
	to be run instead of <application>sendmail</application>, you could change
	<filename>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</filename> to read:</para>

<programlisting>sendmail	 /usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat
send-mail	/usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat
mailq		/usr/local/supermailer/bin/mailq-compat
newaliases	/usr/local/supermailer/bin/newaliases-compat
hoststat	/usr/local/supermailer/bin/hoststat-compat
purgestat	/usr/local/supermailer/bin/purgestat-compat</programlisting>

	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title>Finishing</title>

	<para>Once you have everything configured the way you want it, you should
	  either kill the <application>sendmail</application> processes that
	  you no longer need and start the processes belonging to your new
	  software, or simply reboot.  Rebooting will also
	  give you the opportunity to ensure that you have correctly
	  configured your system to start your new MTA automatically on boot.</para>

	<para>Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	<para>You will probably find that the host is actually in a
	  different domain; for example, if you are in
	  <hostid role="fqdn">foo.bar.edu</hostid> and you wish to reach
	  a host called <hostid>mumble</hostid> in the <hostid
	  role="domainname">bar.edu</hostid> domain, you will have to
	  refer to it by the fully-qualified domain name, <hostid
	  role="fqdn">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>, instead of just
	  <hostid>mumble</hostid>.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>BIND</primary></indexterm>
	<para>Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers.
	  However the current version of <application>BIND</application>
	  that ships with FreeBSD no longer provides default abbreviations
	  for non-fully qualified domain names other than the domain you
	  are in. So an unqualified host <hostid>mumble</hostid> must
	  either be found as <hostid
	  role="fqdn">mumble.foo.bar.edu</hostid>, or it will be searched
	  for in the root domain.</para>

        <para>This is different from the previous behavior, where the
	  search continued across <hostid
	  role="domainname">mumble.bar.edu</hostid>, and <hostid
	  role="domainname">mumble.edu</hostid>. Have a look at RFC 1535
	  for why this was considered bad practice, or even a security
	  hole.</para>

        <para>As a good workaround, you can place the line:

          <programlisting>search foo.bar.edu bar.edu</programlisting>

          instead of the previous:

          <programlisting>domain foo.bar.edu</programlisting>

          into your <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  However, make
	  sure that the search order does not go beyond the

	  as RFC 1535 calls it.</para>

	<para>This is answered in the

553 relay.domain.net config error: mail loops back to myself
554 &lt;user@domain.net&gt;... Local configuration error

How can I solve this problem?

You have asked mail to the domain (e.g., domain.net) to be
forwarded to a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net)
by using an MX record, but the relay machine does not recognize
itself as domain.net. Add domain.net to /etc/mail/local-host-names
(if you are using FEATURE(use_cw_file)) or add <quote>Cw domain.net</quote>
to /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.</programlisting>

	<para>You want to connect a FreeBSD box on a LAN to the

	  The PPP connection is non-dedicated.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>UUCP</primary></indexterm>

	<para>There are at least two ways to do this.  One way is to use
	  UUCP.</para>

	<para>Another way is to get a full-time Internet server to provide secondary MX
	  services for your domain.  For example, if your company's domain is
	  <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid> and your Internet service provider has
	  set <hostid role="domainname">example.net</hostid> up to provide secondary MX services
	  to your domain:</para>

	<programlisting>example.com.          MX        10      example.com.
                      MX        20      example.net.</programlisting>

	<para>Only one host should be specified as the final recipient
	  (add <literal>Cw example.com</literal> in
	  <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename> on <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid>).</para>

	<para>When the sending <command>sendmail</command> is trying to
	  deliver the mail it will try to connect to you (<hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid>) over the modem
	  link.  It will most likely time out because you are not online.
	  The program <application>sendmail</application> will automatically deliver it to the
	  secondary MX site, i.e. your Internet provider (<hostid role="domainname">example.net</hostid>).  The secondary MX
	  site will then periodically try to connect to
	  your host and deliver the mail to the primary MX host (<hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid>).</para>

	<para>You might want to use something like this as a login
	  script:</para>

	<programlisting>#!/bin/sh
# Put me in /usr/local/bin/pppmyisp
( sleep 60 ; /usr/sbin/sendmail -q ) &amp;
/usr/sbin/ppp -direct pppmyisp</programlisting>

	<para>If you are going to create a separate login script for a
	  user you could use <command>sendmail -qRexample.com</command>
	  instead in the script above. This will force all mail in your
	  queue for <hostid role="domainname">example.com</hostid> to be processed immediately.</para>

	<para>A further refinement of the situation is as follows:</para>

	<para>Message stolen from the &a.isp;.</para>

	<programlisting>&gt; we provide the secondary MX for a customer. The customer connects to
&gt; our services several times a day automatically to get the mails to
&gt; his primary MX (We do not call his site when a mail for his domains
&gt; arrived). Our sendmail sends the mailqueue every 30 minutes. At the
&gt; moment he has to stay 30 minutes online to be sure that all mail is
&gt; gone to the primary MX.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a command that would initiate sendmail to send all the mails
&gt; now? The user has not root-privileges on our machine of course.

In the <quote>privacy flags</quote> section of sendmail.cf, there is a
definition Opgoaway,restrictqrun

Remove restrictqrun to allow non-root users to start the queue processing.
You might also like to rearrange the MXs. We are the 1st MX for our
customers like this, and we have defined:

# If we are the best MX for a host, try directly instead of generating
# local config error.
OwTrue

That way a remote site will deliver straight to you, without trying
the customer connection.  You then send to your customer.  Only works for
<quote>hosts</quote>, so you need to get your customer to name their mail
machine <quote>customer.com</quote> as well as
<quote>hostname.customer.com</quote> in the DNS.  Just put an A record in
the DNS for <quote>customer.com</quote>.</programlisting>

        <question>
	  <para>Why do I keep getting <errorname>Relaying
	    Denied</errorname> errors when sending mail from other
	    hosts?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>In default FreeBSD installations,
 	    <application>sendmail</application> is configured to only
 	    send mail from the host it is running on.  For example, if
 	    a POP3 server is installed, then users will be able to
 	    check mail from school, work, or other remote locations
 	    but they still will not be able to send outgoing emails
 	    from outside locations.  Typically, a few moments after
 	    the attempt, an email will be sent from
 	    <application>MAILER-DAEMON</application> with a
 	    <errorname>5.7 Relaying Denied</errorname> error
 	    message.</para>

	  <para>There are several ways to get around this.  The most
 	    straightforward solution is to put your ISP's address in
 	    a relay-domains file at
 	    <filename>/etc/mail/relay-domains</filename>.  A quick way
 	    to do this would be:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo "your.isp.example.com" &gt; /etc/mail/relay-domains</userinput></screen>

	  <para>After creating or editing this file you must restart
  	    <application>sendmail</application>.  This works great if
  	    you are a server administrator and do not wish to send mail
  	    locally, or would like to use a point and click
  	    client/system on another machine or even another ISP.  It
  	    is also very useful if you only have one or two email
  	    accounts set up.  If there is a large number of addresses
  	    to add, you can simply open this file in your favorite
  	    text editor and then add the domains, one per line:</para>

	  <programlisting>your.isp.example.com
other.isp.example.net
users-isp.example.org
www.example.org</programlisting>

	  <para>Now any mail sent through your system, by any host in
	    this list (provided the user has an account on your
	    system), will succeed.  This is a very nice way to allow
	    users to send mail from your system remotely without
	    allowing people to send SPAM through your system.</para>

	delivered to the MTA (e.g., <application>sendmail</application>) on your own FreeBSD host, there are two methods:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Run your own name server and have your own domain.  For

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <indexterm><primary>SMTP</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Regardless of which of the above you choose, in order to have
        mail delivered directly to your host, it must have a permanent
        static IP address (not a dynamic address, as with most PPP dial-up configurations).  If you are behind a
        firewall, it must pass SMTP traffic on to you.  If you want to
        receive mail directly at your host, you need to be sure of either of two
        things:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <indexterm><primary>MX record</primary></indexterm>
        <listitem>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Either of the above will allow you to receive mail directly at
        your host.</para>

      <para>Try this:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>hostname</userinput>
example.FreeBSD.org
&prompt.root; <userinput>host example.FreeBSD.org</userinput>
example.FreeBSD.org has address 204.216.27.XX</screen>

      <para>If that is what you see, mail directly to
        <email>yourlogin@example.FreeBSD.org</email> should work without
        problems (assuming <application>sendmail</application> is
        running correctly on <hostid role="fqdn">example.FreeBSD.org</hostid>).</para>

      <para>If instead you see something like this:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>host example.FreeBSD.org</userinput>
example.FreeBSD.org has address 204.216.27.XX
example.FreeBSD.org mail is handled (pri=10) by hub.FreeBSD.org</screen>

      <para>All mail sent to your host (<hostid
        role="fqdn">example.FreeBSD.org</hostid>) will end up being
	collected on <hostid>hub</hostid> under the same username instead
	of being sent directly to your host.</para>

      <para>The above information is handled by your DNS server.  The DNS
        record that carries mail routing information is the
        <emphasis>M</emphasis>ail e<emphasis>X</emphasis>change entry.  If
        no MX record exists, mail will be delivered directly to the host by
        way of its IP address.</para>

      <para>The MX entry for <hostid
        role="fqdn">freefall.FreeBSD.org</hostid> at one time looked like

      <programlisting>freefall		MX	30	mail.crl.net
freefall		MX	40	agora.rdrop.com
freefall		MX	10	freefall.FreeBSD.org
freefall		MX	20	who.cdrom.com</programlisting>

      <para>As you can see, <hostid>freefall</hostid> had many MX entries.
        The lowest MX number is the host that receives mail directly if
        available; if it is not accessible for some reason, the others
        (sometimes called <quote>backup MXes</quote>) accept messages
        temporarily, and pass it along when a lower-numbered host becomes
        available, eventually to the lowest-numbered host.</para>

      <para>Alternate MX sites should have separate Internet connections

      <application>sendmail</application> configuration set has been broken out into a separate source
      distribution tarball. Assuming you have your FreeBSD source code
      CDROM mounted, do:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /cdrom/src</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cat scontrib.?? | tar xzf - -C /usr/src/contrib/sendmail</userinput></screen>

    <para>This extracts to only a few hundred kilobytes.  The file
      <filename>README</filename> in the <filename>cf</filename>
      directory can serve as a basic introduction to &man.m4.1;
      configuration.</para>

    <para>The best way to support UUCP delivery is to use the
      <literal>mailertable</literal> feature.  This creates a database
      that <application>sendmail</application> can use to make routing decisions.</para>

    <para>First, you have to create your <filename>.mc</filename>
      file.  The directory
      <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</filename> contains a
      few examples.  Assuming you have named your file
      <filename>foo.mc</filename>, all you need to do in order to
      convert it into a valid <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>
      is:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make foo.cf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp foo.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf</userinput></screen>

    <para>A typical <filename>.mc</filename> file might look
        like:</para>

    <programlisting>VERSIONID(`<replaceable>Your version number</replaceable>') OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

FEATURE(accept_unresolvable_domains)
FEATURE(nocanonify)
FEATURE(mailertable, `hash -o /etc/mail/mailertable')

define(`UUCP_RELAY', <replaceable>your.uucp.relay</replaceable>)
define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)
define(`confDONT_PROBE_INTERFACES')

MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
MAILER(uucp)

Cw    <replaceable>your.alias.host.name</replaceable>
Cw    <replaceable>youruucpnodename.UUCP</replaceable></programlisting>

    <para>The lines containing
      <literal>accept_unresolvable_domains</literal>,
      <literal>nocanonify</literal>, and
      <literal>confDONT_PROBE_INTERFACES</literal> features will
      prevent any usage of the DNS during mail delivery.  The
      <literal>UUCP_RELAY</literal> clause is needed to support UUCP
      delivery.  Simply put an Internet hostname there that is able to
      handle .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely, you will
      enter the mail relay of your ISP there.</para>

    <para>Once you have this, you need an
      <filename>/etc/mail/mailertable</filename> file.  If you have
      only one link to the outside that is used for all your mails,
      the following file will suffice:</para>

    <programlisting>#
# makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable.db &lt; /etc/mail/mailertable
.                             uucp-dom:<replaceable>your.uucp.relay</replaceable></programlisting>

    <para>A more complex example might look like this:</para>

    <programlisting>#
# makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable.db &lt; /etc/mail/mailertable
#
horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
.interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
.heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1
horus.UUCP                    uucp-dom:horus
if-bus.UUCP                   uucp-dom:if-bus
.                             uucp-dom:</programlisting>


    <para>The first three lines handle special cases where
      domain-addressed mail should not be sent out to the default
      route, but instead to some UUCP neighbor in order to
      <quote>shortcut</quote> the delivery path. The next line handles
      mail to the local Ethernet domain that can be delivered using
      SMTP. Finally, the UUCP neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP
      pseudo-domain notation, to allow for a
      <literal><replaceable>uucp-neighbor
      </replaceable>!<replaceable>recipient</replaceable></literal>
      override of the default rules. The last line is always a single
      dot, matching everything else, with UUCP delivery to a UUCP
      neighbor that serves as your universal mail gateway to the
      world. All of the node names behind the
      <literal>uucp-dom:</literal> keyword must be valid UUCP
      neighbors, as you can verify using the command
      <literal>uuname</literal>.</para>

    <para>As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a
      DBM database file before use.  The command line to accomplish
      this is best placed as a comment at the top of the <filename>mailertable</filename> file.
      You always have to execute this command each time you change
      your <filename>mailertable</filename> file.</para>

    <para>Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular
      mail routing would work, remember the <option>-bt</option>
      option to <application>sendmail</application>. It starts <application>sendmail</application> in <emphasis>address test
      mode</emphasis>; simply enter <literal>3,0</literal>, followed
      by the address you wish to test for the mail routing.  The last
      line tells you the used internal mail agent, the destination
      host this agent will be called with, and the (possibly
      translated) address. Leave this mode by typing <keycombo
      action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>sendmail -bt</userinput>
ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;
<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <userinput>3,0 foo@example.com</userinput>
canonify           input: foo @ example . com

    <title>Setting up to send only</title>

    <para>There are many instances where you may only want to send
      mail through a relay.  Some examples are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Your computer is a desktop machine, but you want
	  to use programs such as &man.send-pr.1;.  To do so, you should use
	  your ISP's mail relay.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The computer is a server that does not handle mail
	  locally, but needs to pass off all mail to a relay for
	  processing.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Just about any <acronym>MTA</acronym> is capable of filling
      this particular niche.  Unfortunately, it can be very difficult
      to properly configure a full-featured <acronym>MTA</acronym>
      just to handle offloading mail.  Programs such as
      <application>sendmail</application> and
      <application>postfix</application> are largely overkill for
      this use.</para>

    <para>Additionally, if you are using a typical Internet access
      service, your agreement may forbid you from running a
      <quote>mail server</quote>.</para>

    <para>The easiest way to fulfill those needs is to install the
      <filename role="package">mail/ssmtp</filename> port.  Execute
      the following commands as <username>root</username>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/mail/ssmtp</userinput></screen>
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install replace clean</userinput></screen>

    <para>Once installed,
      <filename role="package">mail/ssmtp</filename> can be configured
      with a four-line file located at
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>root=yourrealemail@example.com
mailhub=mail.example.com
rewriteDomain=example.com
hostname=_HOSTNAME_</programlisting>

    <para>Make sure you use your real email address for
      <username>root</username>.  Enter your ISP's outgoing mail relay
      in place of <hostid role="fqdn">mail.example.com</hostid> (some ISPs call
      this the <quote>outgoing mail server</quote> or
      <quote>SMTP server</quote>).</para>

    <para>Make sure you disable <application>sendmail</application> by
      setting <literal>sendmail_enable="NONE"</literal>
      in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para><filename role="package">mail/ssmtp</filename> has some
      other options available.  See the example configuration file in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/ssmtp</filename> or the manual page of
      <application>ssmtp</application> for some examples and more
      information.</para>

    <para>Setting up <application>ssmtp</application> in this manner
      will allow any software on your computer that needs to send
      mail to function properly, while not violating your ISP's usage
      policy or allowing your computer to be hijacked for spamming.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="SMTP-dialup">
    <title>Using Mail with a Dialup Connection</title>

    <para>If you have a static IP address, you should not need to
      adjust anything from the defaults.  Set your host name to your
      assigned Internet name and <application>sendmail</application> will do the rest.</para>

    <para>If you have a dynamically assigned IP number and use a
      dialup PPP connection to the Internet, you will probably have a
      mailbox on your ISPs mail server. Let's assume your ISP's domain
      is <hostid role="domainname">example.net</hostid>, and that your
      user name is <username>user</username>, you have called your
      machine <hostid role="fqdn">bsd.home</hostid>, and your ISP has
      told you that you may use <hostid
      role="fqdn">relay.example.net</hostid> as a mail relay.</para>

    <para>In order to retrieve mail from your mailbox, you must
      install a retrieval agent. The <application>fetchmail</application> utility
      is a good choice as it supports many different protocols.
      This program is available as a package or from the ports
      collection (<filename role="package">mail/fetchmail</filename>).
      Usually, your ISP will provide POP3. If you are using user PPP,
      you can automatically fetch your mail when an Internet
      connection is established with the following entry in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>MYADDR:
!bg su user -c fetchmail</programlisting>

    <para>If you are using <application>sendmail</application> (as
      shown below) to deliver mail to non-local accounts, you probably
      want to have <application>sendmail</application> process your
      mailqueue as soon as your Internet connection is established.
      To do this, put this command after the
      <command>fetchmail</command> command in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>  !bg su user -c "sendmail -q"</programlisting>

    <para>Assume that you have an account for
      <username>user</username> on <hostid
      role="fqdn">bsd.home</hostid>. In the home directory of
      <username>user</username> on <hostid
      role="fqdn">bsd.home</hostid>, create a
      <filename>.fetchmailrc</filename> file:</para>

    <programlisting>poll example.net protocol pop3 fetchall pass MySecret</programlisting>

    <para>This file should not be readable by anyone except
      <username>user</username> as it contains the password
      <literal>MySecret</literal>.</para>

    <para>In order to send mail with the correct
      <literal>from:</literal> header, you must tell
      <application>sendmail</application> to use
      <literal>user@example.net</literal> rather than
      <literal>user@bsd.home</literal>. You may also wish to tell
      <application>sendmail</application> to send all mail via <hostid
      role="fqdn">relay.example.net</hostid>, allowing quicker mail
      transmission.</para>

    <para>The following <filename>.mc</filename> file should
      suffice:</para>

    <programlisting>VERSIONID(`bsd.home.mc version 1.0')
OSTYPE(bsd4.4)dnl

    <para>Refer to the previous section for details of how to turn
      this <filename>.mc</filename> file into a
      <filename>sendmail.cf</filename> file.  Also, do not forget to
      restart <application>sendmail</application> after updating
      <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>.</para>

  <sect1 id="SMTP-Auth">
    <title>SMTP Authentication</title>

    <para>Having <acronym>SMTP</acronym> Authentication in place on
      your mail server has a number of benefits.
      <acronym>SMTP</acronym> Authentication can add another layer
      of security to <application>sendmail</application>, and has the benefit of giving mobile
      users who switch hosts the ability to use the same mail server
      without the need to reconfigure their mail client settings
      each time.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Install <filename role="package">security/cyrus-sasl</filename>
	  from the ports. You can find this port in
	  <filename role="package">security/cyrus-sasl</filename>.
	  <filename role="package">security/cyrus-sasl</filename> has
	  a number of compile time options to choose from and, for
	  the method we will be using here, make sure to select the
	  <option>pwcheck</option> option.</para>
      </step>


      <step>
	<para>After installing <filename role="package">security/cyrus-sasl</filename>,
	  edit <filename>/usr/local/lib/sasl/Sendmail.conf</filename>
	  (or create it if it does not exist) and add the following
	  line:</para>

	<programlisting>pwcheck_method: passwd</programlisting>

	<para>This method will enable <application>sendmail</application>
	  to authenticate against your FreeBSD <filename>passwd</filename>
	  database.  This saves the trouble of creating a new set of usernames
	  and passwords for each user that needs to use
	  <acronym>SMTP</acronym> authentication, and keeps the login
	  and mail password the same.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Now edit <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> and add the
	  following lines:</para>

	<programlisting>SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/sasl1 -DSASL
SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl</programlisting>

	<para>These lines will give <application>sendmail</application>
	the proper configuration options for linking
	to <filename role="package">cyrus-sasl</filename> at compile time.
	Make sure that <filename role="package">cyrus-sasl</filename>
	has been installed before recompiling
	<application>sendmail</application>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Recompile <application>sendmail</application> by executing the following commands:</para>

&prompt.root; <userinput>make obj</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput></screen>

	<para>The compile of <application>sendmail</application> should not have any problems
	  if <filename>/usr/src</filename> has not been changed extensively
	  and the shared libraries it needs are available.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>After <application>sendmail</application> has been compiled
	  and reinstalled, edit your <filename>/etc/mail/freebsd.mc</filename>
	  file (or whichever file you use as your <filename>.mc</filename> file. Many administrators
	  choose to use the output from &man.hostname.1; as the <filename>.mc</filename> file for
	  uniqueness).  Add these lines to it:</para>

	<programlisting>dnl set SASL options
TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl
define(`confAUTH_MECHANISMS', `GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl
define(`confDEF_AUTH_INFO', `/etc/mail/auth-info')dnl</programlisting>

	<para>These options configure the different methods available to

	If you would like to use a method other than
	<application>pwcheck</application>, please see the
	included documentation.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Finally, run &man.make.1; while in <filename>/etc/mail</filename>.
	  That will run your new <filename>.mc</filename> file and create a <filename>.cf</filename> file named
	  <filename>freebsd.cf</filename> (or whatever name you have used
	  for your <filename>.mc</filename> file).  Then use the
	  command <command>make install restart</command>, which will

	  For more information about this process, you should refer

      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>If all has gone correctly, you should be able to enter your login

      <filename>/var/log/maillog</filename> for any errors.</para>

    <para>You may wish to add the following lines to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
      so this service will be available after every system boot:</para>

    <programlisting>sasl_pwcheck_enable="YES"
sasl_pwcheck_program="/usr/local/sbin/pwcheck"</programlisting>

    <para>This will ensure the initialization of <acronym>SMTP_AUTH</acronym> upon system

    <title>Obtaining a Kernel Crash Dump</title>

    <para>When running a development kernel (e.g., &os.current;), such as a
      kernel under extreme conditions (e.g., very high load averages,
      tens of thousands of connections, exceedingly high number of
      concurrent users, hundreds of &man.jail.8;s, etc.), or using a
      new feature or device driver on &os.stable; (e.g.,
      <acronym>PAE</acronym>), sometimes a kernel will panic.  In the
      event that it does, this chapter will demonstrate how to extract
      useful information out of a crash.</para>

    <para>A system reboot is inevitable once a kernel panics.  Once a
      system is rebooted, the contents of a system's physical memory
      (<acronym>RAM</acronym>) is lost, as well as any bits that are
      on the swap device before the panic.  To preserve the bits in
      physical memory, the kernel makes use of the swap device as a
      temporary place to store the bits that are in RAM across a
      reboot after a crash.  In doing this, when &os; boots after a
      crash, a kernel image can now be extracted and debugging can
      take place.</para>

    <note><para>A swap device that has been configured as a dump
      device still acts as a swap device.  Dumps to non-swap devices
      (such as tapes or CDRWs, for example) are not supported at this time.  A
      <quote>swap device</quote> is synonymous with a <quote>swap
      partition.</quote></para></note>

    <para>Several types of kernel crash dumps are available:</para>
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Full memory dumps</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Hold the complete contents of physical
	      memory.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Minidumps</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Hold only memory pages in use by the kernel
	      (&os;&nbsp;6.2 and higher).</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Textdumps</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Hold captured, scripted, or interactive debugger
	      output (&os;&nbsp;7.1 and higher).</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>Minidumps are the default dump type as of &os;&nbsp;7.0,
	and in most cases will capture all necessary information
	present in a full memory dump, as most problems can be
	isolated only using kernel state.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="config-dumpdev">
      <title>Configuring the Dump Device</title>

      <para>Before the kernel will dump the contents of its physical
	memory to a dump device, a dump device must be configured.  A
	dump device is specified by using the &man.dumpon.8; command
	to tell the kernel where to save kernel crash dumps.  The
	&man.dumpon.8; program must be called after the swap partition
	has been configured with &man.swapon.8;.  This is normally
	handled by setting the <varname>dumpdev</varname> variable in
	&man.rc.conf.5; to the path of the swap device (the
	recommended way to extract a kernel dump) or
	<literal>AUTO</literal> to use the first configured swap
	device.  The default for <varname>dumpdev</varname> is
	<literal>AUTO</literal> in HEAD, and changed to
	<literal>NO</literal> on RELENG_* branches (except for RELENG_7,
	which was left set to <literal>AUTO</literal>).
	On &os;&nbsp;9.0-RELEASE and later versions,
	<application>bsdinstall</application> will ask whether crash dumps
	should be enabled on the target system during the install process.</para>

      <tip><para>Check <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or
	&man.swapinfo.8; for a list of swap devices.</para></tip>

      <important><para>Make sure the <varname>dumpdir</varname>
        specified in &man.rc.conf.5; exists before a kernel
        crash!</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/crash</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 700 /var/crash</userinput></screen>

        <para>Also, remember that the contents of
	  <filename>/var/crash</filename> is sensitive and very likely
	  contains confidential information such as passwords.</para>
      </important>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="extract-dump">
      <title>Extracting a Kernel Dump</title>

        <para>Once a dump has been written to a dump device, the dump
	  must be extracted before the swap device is mounted.
	  To extract a dump
	  from a dump device, use the &man.savecore.8; program.  If
	  <varname>dumpdev</varname> has been set in &man.rc.conf.5;,
	  &man.savecore.8; will be called automatically on the first
	  multi-user boot after the crash and before the swap device
	  is mounted.  The location of the extracted core is placed in
	  the &man.rc.conf.5; value <varname>dumpdir</varname>, by
	  default <filename>/var/crash</filename> and will be named
	  <filename>vmcore.0</filename>.</para>

        <para>In the event that there is already a file called
          <filename>vmcore.0</filename> in
          <filename>/var/crash</filename> (or whatever
          <varname>dumpdir</varname> is set to), the kernel will
          increment the trailing number for every crash to avoid
          overwriting an existing <filename>vmcore</filename> (e.g.,
          <filename>vmcore.1</filename>).  &man.savecore.8; will always
	  create a symbolic link to named <filename>vmcore.last</filename>
	  in <filename>/var/crash</filename> after a dump is saved.
	  This symbolic link can be used to locate the name of the most
	  recent dump.</para>

	<para>The &man.crashinfo.8; utility generates a text file
	  containing a summary of information from a full memory dump
	  or minidump.  If <varname>dumpdev</varname> has been set in
	  &man.rc.conf.5;, &man.crashinfo.8; will be invoked
	  automatically after &man.savecore.8;.  The output is saved
	  to a file in <varname>dumpdir</varname> named
	  <filename>core.txt.<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>If you are testing a new kernel but need to boot a different one in
      order to get your system up and running again, boot it only into single
      user mode using the <option>-s</option> flag at the boot prompt, and
      then perform the following steps:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fsck -p</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -a -t ufs</userinput>       # make sure /var/crash is writable
&prompt.root; <userinput>savecore /var/crash /dev/ad0s1b</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>                  # exit to multi-user</screen>

    <para>This instructs &man.savecore.8; to extract a kernel dump
      from <filename>/dev/ad0s1b</filename> and place the contents in
      <filename>/var/crash</filename>.  Do not forget to make sure the
      destination directory <filename>/var/crash</filename> has enough
      space for the dump.  Also, do not forget to specify the correct path to your swap
      device as it is likely different than
      <filename>/dev/ad0s1b</filename>!</para></tip>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Testing Kernel Dump Configuration</title>
   
      <para>The kernel includes a &man.sysctl.8; node that requests a
       kernel panic.  This can be used to verify that your system is
       properly configured to save kernel crash dumps.  You may wish
       to remount existing file systems as read-only in single user
       mode before triggering the crash to avoid data loss.</para>

       <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>shutdown now</userinput>
...
Enter full pathname of shell or RETURN for /bin/sh:
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -a -u -r</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl debug.kdb.panic=1</userinput>
debug.kdb.panic:panic: kdb_sysctl_panic
...</screen>

      <para>After rebooting, your system should save a dump in
        <filename>/var/crash</filename> along with a matching summary
        from &man.crashinfo.8;.</para>

    <title>Debugging a Kernel Crash Dump with <command>kgdb</command></title>

    <note>
      <para>This section covers &man.kgdb.1;.  The latest version is
        included in the <package>devel/gdb</package>.  An older version
        is also present in &os;&nbsp;11 and earlier.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To enter into the debugger and begin getting information
      from the dump, start kgdb:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kgdb -n <replaceable>N</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the suffix of the

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kgdb -n last</userinput></screen>

    <para>Normally, &man.kgdb.1; should be able to locate the kernel
     running at the time the dump was generated.  If it is not able to
     locate the correct kernel, pass the pathname of the kernel and
     dump as two arguments to kgdb:</para>

    <para>You can debug the crash dump using the kernel sources just like
      you can for any other program.</para>

    <para>This dump is from a 5.2-BETA kernel and the crash
      comes from deep within the kernel.  The output below has been
      modified to include line numbers on the left.  This first trace
      inspects the instruction pointer and obtains a back trace.  The
      address that is used on line 41 for the <command>list</command>
      command is the instruction pointer and can be found on line
      17.  Most developers will request having at least this
      information sent to them if you are unable to debug the problem
      yourself.  If, however, you do solve the problem, make sure that
      your patch winds its way into the source tree via a problem
      report, mailing lists, or by being able to commit it!</para>

    <title>On-Line Kernel Debugging Using DDB</title>

    <para>While <command>kgdb</command> as an off-line debugger provides a very
      high level of user interface, there are some things it cannot do.  The
      most important ones being breakpointing and single-stepping kernel
      code.</para>

    <para>If you need to do low-level debugging on your kernel, there is an
      on-line debugger available called DDB.  It allows setting of
      breakpoints, single-stepping kernel functions, examining and changing
      kernel variables, etc.  However, it cannot access kernel source files,
      and only has access to the global and static symbols, not to the full
      debug information like <command>kgdb</command> does.</para>

    <para>To configure your kernel to include DDB, add the options

      <programlisting>options KDB</programlisting>
      <programlisting>options DDB</programlisting>

      to your config file, and rebuild.  (See <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">The FreeBSD Handbook</link> for details on
      configuring the FreeBSD kernel).</para>

    <para>Once your DDB kernel is running, there are several ways to enter
      DDB.  The first, and earliest way is to use the boot flag
      <option>-d</option>.  The kernel will start up
      in debug mode and enter DDB prior to any device probing.  Hence you can
      even debug the device probe/attach functions.  To use this, exit
      the loader's boot menu and enter <command>boot -d</command> at
      the loader prompt.</para>

    <para>The second scenario is to drop to the debugger once the
      system has booted.  There are two simple ways to accomplish
      this.  If you would like to break to the debugger from the
      command prompt, simply type the command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl debug.kdb.enter=1</userinput></screen>

    <para>Alternatively, if you are at the system console, you may use
      a hot-key on the keyboard.  The default break-to-debugger
      sequence is <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>ESC</keycap></keycombo>.  For
      syscons, this sequence can be remapped and some of the
      distributed maps out there do this, so check to make sure you
      know the right sequence to use.  There is an option available
      for serial consoles that allows the use of a serial line BREAK on the
      console line to enter DDB (<literal>options BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>
      in the kernel config file).  It is not the default since there are a lot
      of serial adapters around that gratuitously generate a BREAK
      condition, for example when pulling the cable.</para>

    <para>The third way is that any panic condition will branch to DDB if the
      kernel is configured to use it.  For this reason, it is not wise to
      configure a kernel with DDB for a machine running unattended.</para>

    <para>To obtain the unattended functionality, add:</para>

    <programlisting>options	KDB_UNATTENDED</programlisting>

    <para>to the kernel configuration file and rebuild/reinstall.</para>

    <para>The DDB commands roughly resemble some <command>gdb</command>
      commands.  The first thing you probably need to do is to set a
      breakpoint:</para>

    <screen><userinput>break function-name address</userinput></screen>

    <para>Numbers are taken hexadecimal by default, but to make them distinct
      from symbol names; hexadecimal numbers starting with the letters
      <literal>a-f</literal> need to be preceded with <literal>0x</literal>
      (this is optional for other numbers).  Simple expressions are allowed,
      for example: <literal>function-name + 0x103</literal>.</para>

    <para>To exit the debugger and continue execution,
      type:</para>

    <screen><userinput>continue</userinput></screen>

    <para>To get a stack trace of the current thread, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>trace</userinput></screen>

    <para>To get a stack trace of an arbitrary thread, specify a
      process ID or thread ID as a second argument to
      <command>trace</command>.</para>

    <para>If you want to remove a breakpoint, use</para>

    <screen><userinput>del</userinput>
<userinput>del address-expression</userinput></screen>

    <para>The first form will be accepted immediately after a breakpoint hit,
      and deletes the current breakpoint.  The second form can remove any
      breakpoint, but you need to specify the exact address; this can be
      obtained from:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show b</userinput></screen>

    <para>or:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show break</userinput></screen>

    <para>To single-step the kernel, try:</para>

    <screen><userinput>s</userinput></screen>

    <para>This will step into functions, but you can make DDB trace them until
      the matching return statement is reached by:</para>

    <screen><userinput>n</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>This is different from <command>gdb</command>'s
	<command>next</command> statement; it is like <command>gdb</command>'s
	<command>finish</command>.  Pressing <keycap>n</keycap> more than once
        will cause a continue.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To examine data from memory, use (for example):

      <screen><userinput>x/wx 0xf0133fe0,40</userinput>
<userinput>x/hd db_symtab_space</userinput>
<userinput>x/bc termbuf,10</userinput>
<userinput>x/s stringbuf</userinput></screen>

      for word/halfword/byte access, and hexadecimal/decimal/character/ string
      display.  The number after the comma is the object count.  To display
      the next 0x10 items, simply use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>x ,10</userinput></screen>

    <para>Similarly, use

      <screen><userinput>x/ia foofunc,10</userinput></screen>

      to disassemble the first 0x10 instructions of
      <function>foofunc</function>, and display them along with their offset
      from the beginning of <function>foofunc</function>.</para>

    <para>To modify memory, use the write command:</para>

    <screen><userinput>w/b termbuf 0xa 0xb 0</userinput>
<userinput>w/w 0xf0010030 0 0</userinput></screen>

    <para>The command modifier
      (<literal>b</literal>/<literal>h</literal>/<literal>w</literal>)
      specifies the size of the data to be written, the first following
      expression is the address to write to and the remainder is interpreted
      as data to write to successive memory locations.</para>

    <para>If you need to know the current registers, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show reg</userinput></screen>

    <para>Alternatively, you can display a single register value by e.g.

      <screen><userinput>p $eax</userinput></screen>

      and modify it by:</para>

    <screen><userinput>set $eax new-value</userinput></screen>

    <para>Should you need to call some kernel functions from DDB, simply
      say:</para>

    <screen><userinput>call func(arg1, arg2, ...)</userinput></screen>

    <para>The return value will be printed.</para>

    <para>For a &man.ps.1; style summary of all running processes, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>ps</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now you have examined why your kernel failed, and you wish to
      reboot.  Remember that, depending on the severity of previous
      malfunctioning, not all parts of the kernel might still be working as
      expected.  Perform one of the following actions to shut down and reboot
      your system:</para>

    <screen><userinput>panic</userinput></screen>

    <para>This will cause your kernel to dump core and reboot, so you can
      later analyze the core on a higher level with &man.kgdb.1;.</para>

    <screen><userinput>call boot(0)</userinput></screen>

    <para>Might be a good way to cleanly shut down the running system,
      <function>sync()</function> all disks, and finally, in some cases,
      reboot.  As long as
      the disk and filesystem interfaces of the kernel are not damaged, this
      could be a good way for an almost clean shutdown.</para>

    <screen><userinput>reset</userinput></screen>

    <para>This is the final way out of disaster and almost the same as hitting the
      Big Red Button.</para>

    <para>If you need a short command summary, simply type:</para>

    <screen><userinput>help</userinput></screen>

    <para>It is highly recommended to have a printed copy of the
	&man.ddb.4; manual page ready for a debugging
      session.  Remember that it is hard to read the on-line manual while
      single-stepping the kernel.</para>

    <title>On-Line Kernel Debugging Using Remote GDB</title>

    <para>This feature has been supported since FreeBSD 2.2, and it is
      actually a very neat one.</para>

    <para>GDB has already supported <emphasis>remote debugging</emphasis> for
      a long time.  This is done using a very simple protocol along a serial
      line.  Unlike the other methods described above, you will need two
      machines for doing this.  One is the host providing the debugging
      environment, including all the sources, and a copy of the kernel binary
      with all the symbols in it, and the other one is the target machine that
      simply runs a similar copy of the very same kernel (but stripped of the
      debugging information).</para>

    <para>You should configure the kernel in question with <command>config
	-g</command> if building the <quote>traditional</quote> way.  If
      building the <quote>new</quote> way, make sure that
      <literal>makeoptions DEBUG=-g</literal> is in the configuration.
      In both cases, include <option>DDB</option> in the configuration, and
      compile it as usual.  This gives a large binary, due to the
      debugging information.  Copy this kernel to the target machine, strip
      the debugging symbols off with <command>strip -x</command>, and boot it
      using the <option>-d</option> boot option.  Connect the serial line
      of the target machine that has "flags 080" set on its uart device
      to any serial line of the debugging host.  See &man.uart.4; for
      information on how to set the flags on an uart device.
      Now, on the debugging machine, go to the compile directory of the target
      kernel, and start <command>gdb</command>:</para>

    <title>Kernel debugging with Dcons</title>

    <para>&man.dcons.4; is a very simple console driver that is
      not directly connected with any physical devices.  It just reads
      and writes characters from and to a buffer in a kernel or
      loader.  Due to its simple nature, it is very useful for kernel
      debugging, especially with a &firewire; device.  Currently, &os;

    <title>Glossary of Kernel Options for Debugging</title>

    <para>This section provides a brief glossary of compile-time kernel
      options used for debugging:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB</literal>: compiles in the kernel
	  debugger framework.  Required for <literal>options DDB</literal>
	  and <literal>options GDB</literal>.  Little or no performance
	  overhead.  By default, the debugger will be entered on panic
	  instead of an automatic reboot.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB_UNATTENDED</literal>: change the default
	  value of the <literal>debug.debugger_on_panic</literal> sysctl to
	  0, which controls whether the debugger is entered on panic.  When
	  <literal>options KDB</literal> is not compiled into the kernel, the
	  behavior is to automatically reboot on panic; when it is compiled
	  into the kernel, the default behavior is to drop into the debugger
	  unless <literal>options KDB_UNATTENDED</literal> is compiled in.
	  If you want to leave the kernel debugger compiled into the kernel
	  but want the system to come back up unless you're on-hand to use
	  the debugger for diagnostics, use this option.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB_TRACE</literal>: change the default value
	  of the <literal>debug.trace_on_panic</literal> sysctl to 1, which
	  controls whether the debugger automatically prints a stack trace
	  on panic.  Especially if running with <literal>options
	  KDB_UNATTENDED</literal>, this can be helpful to gather basic
	  debugging information on the serial or firewire console while
	  still rebooting to recover.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DDB</literal>: compile in support for the
	  console debugger, DDB.  This interactive debugger runs on whatever
	  the active low-level console of the system is, which includes the
	  video console, serial console, or firewire console.  It provides
	  basic integrated debugging facilities, such as stack tracing,
	  process and thread listing, dumping of lock state, VM state, file
	  system state, and kernel memory management.  DDB does not require
	  software running on a second machine or being able to generate a
	  core dump or full debugging kernel symbols, and provides detailed
	  diagnostics of the kernel at run-time.  Many bugs can be fully
	  diagnosed using only DDB output.  This option depends on
	  <literal>options KDB</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options GDB</literal>: compile in support for the
	  remote debugger, GDB, which can operate over serial cable or
	  firewire.  When the debugger is entered, GDB may be attached to
	  inspect structure contents, generate stack traces, etc.  Some
	  kernel state is more awkward to access than in DDB, which is able
	  to generate useful summaries of kernel state automatically, such
	  as automatically walking lock debugging or kernel memory
	  management structures, and a second machine running the debugger
	  is required.  On the other hand, GDB combines information from
	  the kernel source and full debugging symbols, and is aware of full
	  data structure definitions, local variables, and is scriptable.
	  This option is not required to run GDB on a kernel core dump.
	  This option depends on <literal>options KDB</literal>.
	  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>, <literal>options
	  ALT_BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>: allow a break signal or
	  alternative signal on the console to enter the debugger.  If the
	  system hangs without a panic, this is a useful way to reach the
	  debugger.  Due to the current kernel locking, a break signal
	  generated on a serial console is significantly more reliable at
	  getting into the debugger, and is generally recommended.  This
	  option has little or no performance impact.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>options INVARIANTS</literal>: compile into the kernel
	  a large number of run-time assertion checks and tests, which
	  constantly test the integrity of kernel data structures and the
	  invariants of kernel algorithms.  These tests can be expensive, so
	  are not compiled in by default, but help provide useful "fail stop"
	  behavior, in which certain classes of undesired behavior enter the
	  debugger before kernel data corruption occurs, making them easier
	  to debug.  Tests include memory scrubbing and use-after-free
	  testing, which is one of the more significant sources of overhead.
	  This option depends on <literal>options INVARIANT_SUPPORT</literal>.
	  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options INVARIANT_SUPPORT</literal>: many of the tests
	  present in <literal>options INVARIANTS</literal> require modified
	  data structures or additional kernel symbols to be defined.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS</literal>: this option enables run-time
	  lock order tracking and verification, and is an invaluable tool for
	  deadlock diagnosis.  WITNESS maintains a graph of acquired lock
	  orders by lock type, and checks the graph at each acquire for
	  cycles (implicit or explicit).  If a cycle is detected, a warning
	  and stack trace are generated to the console, indicating that a
	  potential deadlock might have occurred.  WITNESS is required in
	  order to use the <command>show locks</command>, <command>show
	  witness</command> and <command>show alllocks</command> DDB
	  commands.  This debug option has significant performance overhead,
	  which may be somewhat mitigated through the use of <literal>options
	  WITNESS_SKIPSPIN</literal>.  Detailed documentation may be found in
	  &man.witness.4;.</para>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS_SKIPSPIN</literal>: disable run-time
	  checking of spinlock lock order with WITNESS.  As spin locks are
	  acquired most frequently in the scheduler, and scheduler events
	  occur often, this option can significantly speed up systems
	  running with WITNESS.  This option depends on <literal>options
	  WITNESS</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS_KDB</literal>: change the default
	  value of the <literal>debug.witness.kdb</literal> sysctl to 1,
	  which causes WITNESS to enter the debugger when a lock order
	  violation is detected, rather than simply printing a warning.  This
	  option depends on <literal>options WITNESS</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options SOCKBUF_DEBUG</literal>: perform extensive
	  run-time consistency checking on socket buffers, which can be
	  useful for debugging both socket bugs and race conditions in
	  protocols and device drivers that interact with sockets.  This
	  option significantly impacts network performance, and may change
	  the timing in device driver races.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DEBUG_VFS_LOCKS</literal>: track lock
	  acquisition points for lockmgr/vnode locks, expanding the amount
	  of information displayed by <command>show lockedvnods</command>
	  in DDB.  This option has a measurable performance impact.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DEBUG_MEMGUARD</literal>: a replacement for
	  the &man.malloc.9; kernel memory allocator that uses the VM system
	  to detect reads or writes from allocated memory after free.
	  Details may be found in &man.memguard.9;.  This option has a
	  significant performance impact, but can be very helpful in
	  debugging kernel memory corruption bugs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DIAGNOSTIC</literal>: enable additional, more
	  expensive diagnostic tests along the lines of <literal>options
	  INVARIANTS</literal>.</para>

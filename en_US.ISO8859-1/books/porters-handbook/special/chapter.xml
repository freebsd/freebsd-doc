  <title>Special Considerations</title>

  <para>This section explains the most common things to consider when
    creating a port.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="staging">
    <title>Staging</title>

    <para><filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> expects ports to work
      with a <quote>stage directory</quote>.  This means that a port
      must not install files directly to the regular destination
      directories (that is, under <varname>PREFIX</varname>, for
      example) but instead into a separate directory from which the
      package is then built.  In many cases, this does not require
      root privileges, making it possible to build packages as an
      unprivileged user.  With staging, the port is built and
      installed into the stage directory,
      <varname>STAGEDIR</varname>.  A package is created from the
      stage directory and then installed on the system.  Automake
      tools refer to this concept as <varname>DESTDIR</varname>, but
      in &os;, <varname>DESTDIR</varname> has a different meaning
      (see <xref linkend="porting-prefix"/>).</para>

    <note>
      <para>No port <emphasis>really</emphasis> needs to be root.  It
	can mostly be avoided by using <link
	  linkend="uses-uidfix"><literal>USES=uidfix</literal></link>.
	If the port still runs commands like &man.chown.8;,
	&man.chgrp.1;, or forces owner or group with &man.install.1;
	then use <link
	  linkend="uses-fakeroot"><literal>USES=fakeroot</literal></link>
	to fake those calls.  Some patching of the port's
	<filename>Makefiles</filename> will be needed.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Meta ports, or ports that do not install files themselves
      but only depend on other ports, must avoid needlessly
      extracting the &man.mtree.8; to the stage directory.  This is
      the basic directory layout of the package, and these empty
      directories will be seen as orphans.  To prevent
      &man.mtree.8; extraction, add this line:</para>

    <programlisting>NO_MTREE=	yes</programlisting>

    <tip>
      <para>Metaports should use <link
	  linkend="uses-metaport"><literal>USES=metaport</literal></link>.
	It sets up defaults for ports that do not fetch, build, or
	install anything.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>Staging is enabled by prepending
      <varname>STAGEDIR</varname> to paths used in the
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget>,
      <buildtarget>do-install</buildtarget>, and
      <buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> targets (see the
      examples through the book).  Typically, this includes
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>, <varname>ETCDIR</varname>,
      <varname>DATADIR</varname>, <varname>EXAMPLESDIR</varname>,
      <varname>MANPREFIX</varname>, <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>, and
      so on.  Directories should be created as part of the
      <buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target.  Avoid using
      absolute paths whenever possible.</para>

    <para>When creating a symlink, <varname>STAGEDIR</varname>
      is prepended to the target path only.  For
      example:</para>

    <programlisting>${LN} -sf <replaceable>libfoo.so.42</replaceable> ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/<replaceable>libfoo.so</replaceable></programlisting>

    <para>The source path
      <filename>${PREFIX}/lib/<replaceable>libfoo.so.42</replaceable></filename>
      looks fine but could, in fact, be incorrect.  Absolute paths can
      point to a wrong location, like when a remote file system has
      been mounted with <acronym>NFS</acronym> under a non-root mount
      point.  Relative paths are less fragile, and often much
      shorter.</para>

    <para>Ports that install kernel modules must prepend
      <varname>STAGEDIR</varname> to their destination, by default
      <filename>/boot/modules</filename>.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="bundled-libs">
    <title>Bundled Libraries</title>

    <para>This section explains why bundled dependencies are
      considered bad and what to do about them.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="bundled-libs-why-bad">
      <title>Why Bundled Libraries Are Bad</title>

      <para>Some software requires the porter to locate third-party
	libraries and add the required dependencies to the port.
	Other software bundles all necessary libraries into the
	distribution file.  The second approach seems easier at
	first, but there are some serious drawbacks:</para>

      <para>This list is loosely based on the <link
	  xlink:href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:No_Bundled_Libraries">Fedora</link>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Security</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If vulnerabilities are found in the upstream library
	      and fixed there, they might not be fixed in the library
	      bundled with the port.  One reason could be that the
	      author is not aware of the problem.  This means that the
	      porter must fix them, or upgrade to a non-vulnerable
	      version, and send a patch to the author.  This all takes
	      time, which results in software being vulnerable longer
	      than necessary.  This in turn makes it harder to
	      coordinate a fix without unnecessarily leaking
	      information about the vulnerability.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Bugs</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>This problem is similar to the problem with security
	      in the last paragraph, but generally less severe.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Forking</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>It is easier for the author to fork the upstream
	      library once it is bundled.  While convenient on first
	      sight, it means that the code diverges from upstream
	      making it harder to address security or other problems
	      with the software.  A reason for this is that patching
	      becomes harder.</para>

	    <para>Another problem of forking is that because code
	      diverges from upstream, bugs get solved over and over
	      again instead of just once at a central location.  This
	      defeats the idea of open source software in the first
	      place.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Symbol collision</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>When a library is installed on the system, it might
	      collide with the bundled version.  This can cause
	      immediate errors at compile or link time.  It can also
	      cause errors when running the program which might be
	      harder to track down.  The latter problem could be
	      caused because the versions of the two libraries are
	      incompatible.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Licensing</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>When bundling projects from different sources,
	      license issues can arise more easily, especially when
	      licenses are incompatible.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Waste of resources</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Bundled libraries waste resources on several levels.
	      It takes longer to build the actual application,
	      especially if these libraries are already present on the
	      system.  At run-time, they can take up unnecessary
	      memory when the system-wide library is already loaded by
	      one program and the bundled library is loaded by another
	      program.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Waste of effort</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>When a library needs patches for &os;, these patches
	      have to be duplicated again in the bundled library.
	      This wastes developer time because the patches might not
	      apply cleanly.  It can also be hard to notice that these
	      patches are required in the first place.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="bundled-libs-practices">
      <title>What to do About Bundled Libraries</title>

      <para>Whenever possible, use the unbundled version of the
	library by adding a <varname>LIB_DEPENDS</varname> to the
	port.  If such a port does not exist yet, consider creating
	it.</para>

      <para>Only use bundled libraries if the upstream has a
	good track record on security and using unbundled versions
	leads to overly complex patches.</para>

      <note>
	<para>In some very special cases, for example emulators, like
	  <application>Wine</application>, a port has to bundle
	  libraries, because they are in a different architecture, or
	  they have been modified to fit the software's use.  In that
	  case, those libraries should not be exposed to other ports
	  for linking.  Add <literal>BUNDLE_LIBS=yes</literal> to the
	  port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  This will tell
	  &man.pkg.8; to not compute provided libraries.  Always ask
	  the &a.portmgr; before adding this to a port.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-shlibs">
    <title>Shared Libraries</title>

    <para>If the port installs one or more shared libraries, define
      a <varname>USE_LDCONFIG</varname> make variable, which will
      instruct a <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to run
      <literal>&dollar;{LDCONFIG} -m</literal> on the directory
      where the new library is installed (usually
      <filename>PREFIX/lib</filename>) during
      <buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target to register it
      into the shared library cache.  This variable, when defined,
      will also facilitate addition of an appropriate
      <literal>@exec /sbin/ldconfig -m</literal> and
      <literal>@unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R</literal> pair into
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, so that a user who
      installed the package can start using the shared library
      immediately and de-installation will not cause the system to
      still believe the library is there.</para>

    <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	yes</programlisting>

    <para>The default directory can be overridden by
      setting <varname>USE_LDCONFIG</varname> to a list of
      directories into which shared libraries are to be installed.
      For example, if the port installs shared libraries into
      <filename>PREFIX/lib/foo</filename> and
      <filename>PREFIX/lib/bar</filename>
      use this in
      <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	${PREFIX}/lib/foo ${PREFIX}/lib/bar</programlisting>

    <para>Please double-check, often this is not necessary at all or
      can be avoided through <literal>-rpath</literal> or setting
      <envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar> during linking (see
      <package role="port">lang/moscow_ml</package> for an
      example), or through a shell-wrapper which sets
      <varname>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</varname> before invoking the binary,
      like <package role="port">www/seamonkey</package>
      does.</para>

    <para>When installing 32-bit libraries on 64-bit system, use
      <varname>USE_LDCONFIG32</varname> instead.</para>

    <para>If the software uses <link
	linkend="using-autotools">autotools</link>, and specifically
      <command>libtool</command>, add <link
	linkend="uses-libtool"><literal>USES=libtool</literal></link>.</para>

    <para>When the major library version number increments in the
      update to the new port version, all other ports that link to
      the affected library must have their
      <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> incremented, to force
      recompilation with the new library version.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-restrictions">
    <title>Ports with Distribution Restrictions or Legal
      Concerns</title>

    <para>Licenses vary, and some of them place restrictions on how
      the application can be packaged, whether it can be sold for
      profit, and so on.</para>

    <important>
      <para>It is the responsibility of a porter to read the
	licensing terms of the software and make sure that the
	&os; project will not be held accountable for violating
	them by redistributing the source or compiled binaries
	either via FTP/HTTP or CD-ROM.  If in doubt, please contact
	the &a.ports;.</para>
    </important>

    <para>In situations like this, the variables described in the
      next sections can be set.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-no_package">
      <title><varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname></title>

      <para>This variable indicates that we may not generate a
	binary package of the application.  For instance, the
	license may disallow binary redistribution, or it may
	prohibit distribution of packages created from patched
	sources.</para>

      <para>However, the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname> may be
	freely mirrored on FTP/HTTP.  They may also be distributed
	on a CD-ROM (or similar media) unless
	<varname>NO_CDROM</varname> is set as well.</para>

      <para>If the
	binary package is not generally useful, and the application
	must always be compiled from the source code, use
	<varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>.  For
	example, if the application has configuration information
	that is site specific hard coded into it at compile time,
	set <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>.</para>

      <para>Set <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname> to a string
	describing the reason why the package cannot be
	generated.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-no_cdrom">
      <title><varname>NO_CDROM</varname></title>

      <para>This variable alone indicates that, although we are
	allowed to generate binary packages, we may put neither
	those packages nor the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname>
	onto a CD-ROM (or similar media) for resale.  However, the
	binary packages and the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname>
	will still be available via FTP/HTTP.</para>

      <para> If this variable is set along with
	<varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>, then only the port's
	<varname>DISTFILES</varname> will be available, and only via
	FTP/HTTP.</para>

      <para>Set <varname>NO_CDROM</varname> to a string
	describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed
	on CD-ROM.  For instance, use this if the port's
	license is for <quote>non-commercial</quote> use
	only.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-nofetchfiles">
      <title><varname>NOFETCHFILES</varname></title>

      <para>Files defined in <varname>NOFETCHFILES</varname>
	are not fetchable from any of
	<varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  An example of such a file
	is when the file is supplied on CD-ROM by the vendor.</para>

      <para>Tools which check for the availability of these files
	on <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> have to ignore these
	files and not report about them.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-restricted">
      <title><varname>RESTRICTED</varname></title>

      <para>Set this variable alone if the application's license
	permits neither mirroring the application's
	<varname>DISTFILES</varname> nor distributing the binary
	package in any way.</para>

      <para>Do not set <varname>NO_CDROM</varname> or
	<varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname> along with
	<varname>RESTRICTED</varname>, since the latter variable
	implies the former ones.</para>

      <para>Set <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> to a string
	describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed.
	Typically, this indicates that the port contains proprietary
	software and that the user will need to manually download
	the <varname>DISTFILES</varname>, possibly after registering
	for the software or agreeing to accept the terms of an
	<acronym>EULA</acronym>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-restricted_files">
      <title><varname>RESTRICTED_FILES</varname></title>

      <para>When <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> or
	<varname>NO_CDROM</varname> is set, this variable defaults
	to <literal>${DISTFILES} ${PATCHFILES}</literal>, otherwise
	it is empty.  If only some of the distribution files are
	restricted, then set this variable to list them.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-legal_text">
      <title><varname>LEGAL_TEXT</varname></title>

      <para>If the port has legal concerns not addressed by the
	above variables, set <varname>LEGAL_TEXT</varname>
	to a string explaining the concern.  For
	example, if special permission was obtained for &os; to
	redistribute the binary, this variable must indicate
	so.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-legal">
      <title><filename>/usr/ports/LEGAL</filename> and
	<varname>LEGAL</varname></title>

      <para>A port which sets any of the above variables must also
	be added to <filename>/usr/ports/LEGAL</filename>.  The
	first column is a glob which matches the restricted
	distfiles.  The second column is the port's origin.  The
	third column is the output of
	<command>make -VLEGAL</command>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="porting-restrictions-examples">
      <title>Examples</title>

      <para>The preferred way to state "the distfiles for this port
	must be fetched manually" is as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>.if !exists(${DISTDIR}/${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX})
IGNORE=	may not be redistributed because of licensing reasons. Please visit <replaceable>some-website</replaceable> to accept their license and download ${DISTFILES} into ${DISTDIR}
.endif</programlisting>

      <title>Building Ports in Parallel</title>

      <para>The &os; ports framework supports parallel building
	using multiple <command>make</command> sub-processes, which
	allows <acronym>SMP</acronym> systems to utilize all of
	their available <acronym>CPU</acronym> power, allowing port
	builds to be faster and more effective.</para>

      <para>This is achieved by passing <varname>-jX</varname> flag
	to &man.make.1; running on vendor code.  This is the default
	build behavior of ports.  Unfortunately, not all ports
	handle parallel building well and it may be required to
	explicitly disable this feature by adding the
	<literal>MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE=yes</literal> variable.  It is
	used when a port is known to be broken with
	<varname>-jX</varname>.</para>

      <para>Several differing <literal>make</literal>

      <para><varname>MAKE_CMD</varname> can be used to reference the

	(for the legacy &os; version) are available.
	Only use <varname>MAKE_CMD</varname> within the

	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> will be replaced by
	<quote><literal>@comment&nbsp;</literal></quote> if NLS is
	disabled, or by a null string if NLS is enabled.
	Consequently, the lines prefixed by
	<literal>%%NLS%%</literal> will become mere comments in the
	final packing list if NLS is off; otherwise the prefix will
	be just left out.  Then insert
	<literal>%%NLS%%</literal> before each path to a message
	catalog file in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  For

      <para>Adding this variable to the port allows the use of

      <para><varname>USE_GNOME</varname> components automatically

    <sect2 xml:id="java-building-with-ant">
      <title>Building with Ant</title>

      <para>When the port is to be built using Apache Ant, it has to
	define <varname>USE_ANT</varname>.  Ant is thus considered to
	be the sub-make command.  When no
	<buildtarget>do-build</buildtarget> target is defined by the
	port, a default one will be set that runs Ant according to
	<varname>MAKE_ENV</varname>, <varname>MAKE_ARGS</varname> and
	<varname>ALL_TARGET</varname>.  This is similar to the
	<literal>USES= gmake</literal> mechanism, which is documented
	in <xref linkend="building"/>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="java-best-practices">
      <title>Best Practices</title>

      <para>When porting a Java library, the port has to install
	the JAR file(s) in <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>, and
	everything else under
	<filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> (except for
	the documentation, see below).  To reduce the packing file
	size, reference the JAR file(s) directly in the
	<filename>Makefile</filename>.  Use this statement (where
	<filename><replaceable>myport</replaceable>.jar</filename> is
	the name of the JAR file installed as part of the
	port):</para>

      <programlisting>PLIST_FILES+=	${JAVAJARDIR}/<replaceable>myport</replaceable>.jar</programlisting>

      <para>When porting a Java application, the port usually
	installs everything under a single directory (including its
	JAR dependencies).  The use of
	<filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> is strongly
	encouraged in this regard.  It is up the porter to decide
	whether the port installs the additional JAR
	dependencies under this directory or uses the
	already installed ones (from
	<filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>).</para>

      <para>When porting a &java; application that requires an
	application server such as
	<package role="port">www/tomcat7</package> to run the
	service, it is quite common for a vendor to distribute a
	<filename>.war</filename>.  A <filename>.war</filename>
	is a Web application ARchive and is extracted when
	called by the application.  Avoid adding a
	<filename>.war</filename>
	to <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.
	It is not considered best practice.  An application server
	will expand <application>war</application> archive, but not
	clean it up properly if the port is removed.  A more
	desirable way of working with this file is to extract the
	archive, then install the files, and lastly add these files
	to <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <programlisting>TOMCATDIR=	${LOCALBASE}/apache-tomcat-7.0
WEBAPPDIR=	myapplication

post-extract:
	@${MKDIR} ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}
	@${TAR} xf ${WRKDIR}/myapplication.war -C ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}

do-install:
	cd ${WRKDIR} &amp;&amp; \
	${INSTALL} -d -o ${WWWOWN} -g ${WWWGRP} ${TOMCATDIR}/webapps/${PORTDIRNAME}
	@cd ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME} &amp;&amp; ${COPYTREE_SHARE} \* ${WEBAPPDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}</programlisting>

      <para>Regardless of the type of port (library or
	application), the additional documentation is installed in the
	<link linkend="install-documentation">same location</link> as
	for any other port.  The JavaDoc tool is known to produce a
	different set of files depending on the version of the
	<acronym>JDK</acronym> that is used.  For ports that do not
	enforce the use of a particular <acronym>JDK</acronym>, it is
	therefore a complex task to specify the packing list
	(<filename>pkg-plist</filename>).  This is one reason why
	porters are strongly encouraged to use
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname>.  Moreover, even if the set of
	files that will be generated by <command>javadoc</command> can
	be predicted, the size of the resulting
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> advocates for the use of
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname>.</para>

      <para>The default value for <varname>DATADIR</varname> is
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}</filename>.  It is a
	good idea to override <varname>DATADIR</varname> to
	<filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> for Java
	ports.  Indeed, <varname>DATADIR</varname> is automatically
	added to <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname> (documented in
	<xref linkend="plist-sub"/>) so use
	<literal>%%DATADIR%%</literal> directly in
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>As for the choice of building Java ports from source or
	directly installing them from a binary distribution, there
	is no defined policy at the time of writing.  However,
	people from the
	<link xlink:href="http://www.freebsd.org/java/">&os; Java
	  Project</link> encourage porters to have their ports
	built from source whenever it is a trivial task.</para>

      <para>All the features that have been presented in this
	section are implemented in <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.
	If the port needs more sophisticated
	Java support, please first have a look at the <link
	  xlink:href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.java.mk?view=log">bsd.java.mk
	  <application>Subversion</application> log</link> as it
	usually takes some time to document the latest features.
	Then, if the needed support that is lacking would be
	beneficial to many other Java ports, feel free to discuss it
	on the &a.java;.</para>

      <para>Although there is a <literal>java</literal> category for
	PRs, it refers to the <acronym>JDK</acronym> porting effort
	from the &os; Java project.  Therefore, submit the Java port
	in the <literal>ports</literal> category as for any other
	port, unless the issue is related to either a
	<acronym>JDK</acronym> implementation or
	<filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.</para>

      <para>Similarly, there is a defined policy regarding the
	<varname>CATEGORIES</varname> of a Java port, which is
	detailed in <xref linkend="makefile-categories"/>.</para>

    <para>Some Python applications claim to have
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname> support (which would be required
      for staging) but it is broken (Mailman up to 2.1.16, for
      instance).  This can be worked around by recompiling the
      scripts.  This can be done, for example, in the
      <buildtarget>post-build</buildtarget> target.  Assuming the
      Python scripts are supposed to reside in
      <varname>PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR</varname> after installation,
      this solution can be applied:</para>

   -d ${PREFIX} -f ${PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR:S;${PREFIX}/;;})</programlisting>

    <para>This recompiles the sources with a path relative to the
      stage directory, and prepends the value of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname> to the file name recorded in the
      byte-compiled output file by <literal>-d</literal>.
      <literal>-f</literal> is required to force recompilation, and
      the <literal>:S;${PREFIX}/;;</literal> strips prefixes from
      the value of <varname>PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR</varname>
      to make it relative to

      <para>There are many versions of the

	In the ports tree this problem has been solved by installing
	each version under a different name using version number

      <para>The obvious disadvantage of this is that each
	application has to be modified to find the expected version.
	Fortunately, most of the applications call the
	<command>wx-config</command> script to determine the
	necessary compiler and linker flags.  The script is named
	differently for every available version.  Majority of
	applications respect an environment variable, or accept a

    <para><filename>rc.d</filename> scripts are used to start

    <programlisting>USE_RC_SUBR=	<replaceable>doormand</replaceable></programlisting>

    <para>Multiple scripts may be listed and will be installed.
      Scripts must be placed in the <filename>files</filename>
      subdirectory and a <literal>.in</literal> suffix must be added
      to their filename.  Standard <varname>SUB_LIST</varname>
      expansions will be ran against this file.  Use of the

run_rc_command "$1"</programlisting>

    <para>Unless there is a very good reason to start the service
      earlier, or it runs as a particular user (other than root), all
      ports scripts must use:</para>

    <programlisting>REQUIRE: LOGIN</programlisting>

    <para>If the startup script launches a daemon that must be
      shutdown, the following will trigger a stop of the service on

    <para>If the script is not starting a persistent service this is
      not necessary.</para>

    <para>For optional configuration elements the &quot;=&quot;
      style of default variable assignment is preferable to the
      &quot;:=&quot; style here, since the former sets a default
      value only if the variable is unset, and the latter sets one
      if the variable is unset <emphasis>or</emphasis> null.  A user
      might very well include something like:</para>

    <programlisting><replaceable>doormand</replaceable>_flags=""</programlisting>

    <para>in their <filename>rc.conf.local</filename>, and a
      variable substitution using &quot;:=&quot; would
      inappropriately override the user's intention.  The
      <literal>_enable</literal> variable is not optional,
      and must use the &quot;:&quot; for the default.</para>

      <para>Before contributing a port with an

      <para>The <package role="port">devel/rclint</package>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>If this is a new file, does it have a
	    <filename>.sh</filename> extension?  If so, that must be
	    changed to just
	    <filename><replaceable>file</replaceable>.in</filename>
	    since <filename>rc.d</filename> files may not end with
	    that extension.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Does the file have a
	    <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal> tag?</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Do the name of the file (minus
	    <filename>.in</filename>), the
	    <literal>PROVIDE</literal> line, and
	    <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	    all match?  The file name matching
	    <literal>PROVIDE</literal> makes debugging easier,
	    especially for &man.rcorder.8; issues.  Matching the
	    file name and
	    <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	    makes it easier to figure out which variables are
	    relevant in <filename>rc.conf[.local]</filename>.  It is
	    also a policy
	    for all new scripts, including those in the base
	    system.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Is the <literal>REQUIRE</literal> line set to
	    <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  This is mandatory for scripts
	    that run as a non-root user.  If it runs as root, is
	    there a good reason for it to run prior to
	    <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  If not, it must run after
	    so that local scrips can be loosely grouped to a point in
	    &man.rcorder.8; after most everything in the base is
	    already running.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Does the script start a persistent service?  If so,
	    it must have <literal>KEYWORD:
	      shutdown</literal>.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Make sure there is no
	    <literal>KEYWORD: &os;</literal> present.  This has
	    not been necessary nor desirable for years.  It is also
	    an indication that the new script was copy/pasted from
	    an old script, so extra caution must be given to the
	    review.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>If the script uses an interpreted language like
	    <command>perl</command>, <command>python</command>, or
	    <command>ruby</command>, make certain that
	    <varname>command_interpreter</varname> is set
	    appropriately, for example, for
	    <application>Perl</application>, by adding
	    <literal>PERL=${PERL}</literal> to

	  <para>Have all occurrences of
	    <filename>/usr/local</filename> been replaced with
	    <literal>%%PREFIX%%</literal>?</para>

	<step>
	  <para>Do the default variable assignments come after
	    <function>load_rc_config</function>?</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Are there default assignments to empty strings?
	    They should be removed, but double-check that the option
	    is documented in the comments at the top of the
	    file.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Are things that are set in variables actually used
	    in the script?</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Are options listed in the default
	    <replaceable>name</replaceable><varname>_flags</varname>
	    things that are actually mandatory?  If so, they must
	    be in <varname>command_args</varname>.  The
	    <option>-d</option> option is a red flag (pardon the
	    pun) here, since it is usually the option to
	    &ldquo;daemonize&rdquo; the process, and therefore is
	    actually mandatory.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para><varname><replaceable>name</replaceable>_flags</varname>
	    must never be included in
	    <varname>command_args</varname> (and vice versa,
	    although that error is less common).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Does the script execute any code unconditionally?
	    This is frowned on.  Usually these things must be
	    dealt with through a
	    <function>start_precmd</function>.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>All boolean tests must use the
	    <function>checkyesno</function> function.  No
	    hand-rolled tests for <literal>[Yy][Ee][Ss]</literal>,
	    etc.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>If there is a loop (for example, waiting for
	    something to start) does it have a counter to terminate
	    the loop?  We do not want the boot to be stuck forever
	    if there is an error.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Does the script create files or directories that
	    need specific permissions, for example, a
	    <filename>pid</filename> that needs to be owned by
	    the user that runs the process?  Rather than the
	    traditional &man.touch.1;/&man.chown.8;/&man.chmod.1;
	    routine, consider using &man.install.1; with the proper
	    command line arguments to do the whole procedure with

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The FreeBSD ports collection is the way almost everyone
      installs applications ("ports") on FreeBSD.  Like everything
      else about FreeBSD, it is primarily a volunteer effort.
      It is important to keep this in mind when reading this
      document.</para>

    <para>In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer
      to maintain an existing port if it is unmaintained&mdash;you
      do not need any special commit privileges to do so.</para>

  </chapter>

  <chapter id="own-port">
    <title>Making a New Port Yourself</title>

    <para>So, you are interested in making your own port or
      upgrading an existing one?  Great!</para>

    <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
      FreeBSD.  If you want to upgrade an existing port, you should
      read this and then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading">.</para>

    <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed, you should
      refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which
      all port Makefiles include.  Even if you do not hack Makefiles
      daily, it is well commented, and you will still gain much
      knowledge from it.  Additionally, you may send specific
      questions to the &a.ports;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Only a fraction of the variables
	(<makevar><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></makevar>) that can
	be overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not
	all) are documented at the start of
	<filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>; the others
	probably ought to be.  Note that this file uses a non-standard
	tab setting: <application>Emacs</application> and
	<application>Vim</application> should recognize the setting on
	loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and &man.ex.1; can be set
	to use the correct value by typing <command>:set
	  tabstop=4</command> once the file has been loaded.</para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Looking for something easy to start with? Take a look at the
      <ulink url="http://wiki.freebsd.org/WantedPorts">list of
	requested ports</ulink> and see if you can work on one (or
      more).</para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="quick-porting">
    <title>Quick Porting</title>

    <para>This section tells you how to quickly create a new port.  In
      many cases, it is not sufficient, so you will have to read
      further on into the document.</para>

    <para>First, get the original tarball and put it into
      <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>, which defaults to
      <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The following assumes that the software compiled
	out-of-the-box, i.e., there was absolutely no change required
	for the port to work on your FreeBSD box.  If you needed to
	change something, you will have to refer to the next section
	too.</para>
    </note>

    <sect1 id="porting-makefile">
      <title>Writing the <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

      <para>The minimal <filename>Makefile</filename> would look
	something like this:</para>

      <programlisting># &dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;

PORTNAME=	oneko
PORTVERSION=	1.1b
CATEGORIES=	games
MASTER_SITES=	ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/X11R5/contrib/

COMMENT=	Cat chasing a mouse all over the screen

MAN1=		oneko.1
MANCOMPRESSED=	yes
USE_IMAKE=	yes

.include &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>In some cases, the <filename>Makefile</filename> of an
	  existing port may contain additional lines in the header,
	  such as the name and email of the person that originally
	  created the port.  This additional information has been
	  declared obsolete, and is being phased out.</para>
      </note>

      <para>See if you can figure it out.  Do not worry about the
	contents of the <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal>
	line, it will be filled in automatically by SVN when the port
	is imported to our main ports tree.  You can find a more
	detailed example in the <link
	  linkend="porting-samplem">sample Makefile</link>
	section.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="porting-desc">
      <title>Writing the Description Files</title>

      <para>There are two description files that are required for
	any port, whether they actually package or not.  They are
	<filename>pkg-descr</filename> and
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  Their
	<filename>pkg-</filename> prefix distinguishes them from
	other files.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><filename>pkg-descr</filename></title>

	<para>This is a longer description of the port.  One to a few
	  paragraphs concisely explaining what the port does is
	  sufficient.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a manual or an
	    in-depth description on how to use or compile the port!
	    <emphasis>Please be careful if you are copying from the
	    <filename>README</filename> or manpage</emphasis>; too
	    often they are not a concise description of the port or
	    are in an awkward format (e.g., manpages have justified
	    spacing).  If the ported software has an official WWW
	    homepage, you should list it here.  Prefix
	    <emphasis>one</emphasis> of the websites with
	    <literal>WWW:</literal> so that automated tools will work
	    correctly.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The following example shows how your
	  <filename>pkg-descr</filename> should look:</para>

	<programlisting>This is a port of oneko, in which a cat chases a poor mouse all over
the screen.
 :
(etc.)

WWW: http://www.oneko.org/</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><filename>pkg-plist</filename></title>

	<para>This file lists all the files installed by the port.  It
	  is also called the <quote>packing list</quote> because the
	  package is generated by packing the files listed here.  The
	  pathnames are relative to the installation prefix (usually
	  <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  If you are using the
	  <makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar> variables
	  (as you should be), do not list any manpages here.  If the
	  port creates directories during installation, make sure to
	  add <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines to remove them when the
	  package is deleted.</para>

	<para>Here is a small example:</para>

	<programlisting>bin/oneko
lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	<para>Refer to the &man.pkg.create.1; manual page for details
	  on the packing list.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>It is recommended that you keep all the filenames in
	    this file sorted alphabetically.  It will make verifying
	    the changes when you upgrade the port much easier.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>Creating a packing list manually can be a very tedious
	    task.  If the port installs a large numbers of files,
	    <link linkend="plist-autoplist">creating the packing list
	      automatically</link> might save time.</para>
	</note>

	<para>There is only one case when
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> can be omitted from a port.
	  If the port installs just a handful of files, and perhaps
	  directories, the files and directories may be listed in the
	  variables <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>, respectively, within the
	  port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For instance, we
	  could get along without <filename>pkg-plist</filename> in
	  the above <filename>oneko</filename> port by adding the
	  following lines to the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>PLIST_FILES=	bin/oneko \
		lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
PLIST_DIRS=	lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	<para>Of course, <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> should be left
	  unset if a port installs no directories of its own.</para>

	<para>The price for this way of listing port's files and
	  directories is that you cannot use command sequences
	  described in &man.pkg.create.1;.  Therefore, it is suitable
	  only for simple ports and makes them even simpler.  At the
	  same time, it has the advantage of reducing the number of
	  files in the ports collection.  Please consider using this
	  technique before you resort to
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>Later we will see how <filename>pkg-plist</filename>
	  and <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> can be used to fulfill
	  <link linkend="plist">more sophisticated
	    tasks</link>.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="porting-checksum">
      <title>Creating the Checksum File</title>

      <para>Just type <command>make makesum</command>.  The ports make
	rules will automatically generate the file
	<filename>distinfo</filename>.</para>

      <para>If a file fetched has its checksum changed regularly and
	you are certain the source is trusted (i.e., it comes from
	manufacturer CDs or documentation generated daily), you should
	specify these files in the <makevar>IGNOREFILES</makevar>
	variable.  Then the checksum is not calculated for that file
	when you run <command>make makesum</command>, but set to

      <para>Now that you are happy with your port, the only thing

  <chapter id="slow">
    <title>Slow Porting</title>

    <para>Ok, so it was not that simple, and the port required some
      modifications to get it to work.  In this section, we will

      the ports paradigm.</para>

    <sect1 id="slow-work">
      <title>How Things Work</title>

      <para>First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when
	the user first types <command>make</command> in your port's
	directory.  You may find that having
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> in another window while you

	do...  <!-- smiley --><emphasis>:-)</emphasis></para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>The <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is run.  The
	    <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is responsible for
	    making sure that the tarball exists locally in
	    <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>.  If
	    <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> cannot find the required
	    files in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> it will look up the
	    URL <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, which is set in the
	    Makefile, as well as our main FTP site at <ulink
	      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/"></ulink>,
	    where we put sanctioned distfiles as backup.  It will then
	    attempt to fetch the named distribution file with
	    <makevar>FETCH</makevar>, assuming that the requesting
	    site has direct access to the Internet.  If that succeeds,
	    it will save the file in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> for
	    future use and proceed.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target is run.
	    It looks for your port's distribution file (typically a
	    <command>gzip</command>ped tarball) in
	    <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> and unpacks it into a temporary
	    subdirectory specified by <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar>
	    (defaults to <filename>work</filename>).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <maketarget>patch</maketarget> target is run.
	    First, any patches defined in
	    <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> are applied.  Second, if any
	    patch files named
	    <filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename>
	    are found in <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> (defaults to the
	    <filename>files</filename> subdirectory), they are applied
	    at this time in alphabetical order.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <maketarget>configure</maketarget> target is run.
	    This can do any one of many different things.</para>

	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <maketarget>build</maketarget> target is run.
	    This is responsible for descending into the port's private
	    working directory (<makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) and building
	    it.  If <makevar>USE_GMAKE</makevar> is set, GNU
	    <command>make</command> will be used, otherwise the system
	    <command>make</command> will be used.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>

      <para>The above are the default actions.  In addition, you can
	define targets
	<maketarget>pre-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>
	or
	<maketarget>post-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>,
	or put scripts with those names, in the
	<filename>scripts</filename> subdirectory, and they will be
	run before or after the default actions are done.</para>

      <para>For example, if you have a
	<maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target defined in your
	<filename>Makefile</filename>, and a file
	<filename>pre-build</filename> in the
	<filename>scripts</filename> subdirectory, the
	<maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target will be called
	after the regular extraction actions, and the
	<filename>pre-build</filename> script will be executed before
	the default build rules are done.  It is recommended that you
	use <filename>Makefile</filename> targets if the actions are
	simple enough, because it will be easier for someone to figure
	out what kind of non-default action the port requires.</para>

      <para>The default actions are done by the
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> targets
	<maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>.
	For example, the commands to extract a port are in the target
	<maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>.  If you are not happy
	with the default target, you can fix it by redefining the
	<maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>
	target in your <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The <quote>main</quote> targets (e.g.,
	  <maketarget>extract</maketarget>,
	  <maketarget>configure</maketarget>, etc.) do nothing more
	  than make sure all the stages up to that one are completed
	  and call the real targets or scripts, and they are not
	  intended to be changed.  If you want to fix the extraction,
	  fix <maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>, but never ever
	  change the way <maketarget>extract</maketarget>
	  operates! Additionally, the target
	  <maketarget>post-deinstall</maketarget> is invalid and
	  is not run by the ports infrastructure.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Now that you understand what goes on when the user types

      <para>If you cannot find a FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected
	to the net, or can only find sites that have irritatingly
	non-standard formats, you might want to put a copy on a
	reliable FTP or HTTP server that you control (e.g., your home
	page).</para>

      <para>If you cannot find somewhere convenient and reliable to
	put the distfile we can <quote>house</quote> it ourselves on
	<hostid>ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>; however, this is the
	least-preferred solution.  The distfile must be placed into
	<filename>~/public_distfiles/</filename> of someone's
	<hostid>freefall</hostid> account.  Ask the person who commits
	your port to do this.  This person will also set
	<makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> to
	<makevar>MASTER_SITE_LOCAL</makevar> and
	<makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> to their
	<hostid>freefall</hostid> username.</para>

      <para>If your port's distfile changes all the time without any
	kind of version update by the author, consider putting the
	distfile on your home page and listing it as the first
	<makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  If you can, try to talk the
	port author out of doing this; it really does help to
	establish some kind of source code control.  Hosting your own
	version will prevent users from getting <errorname>checksum
	  mismatch</errorname> errors, and also reduce the workload of
	maintainers of our FTP site.  Also, if there is only one
	master site for the port, it is recommended that you house a
	backup at your site and list it as the second
	<makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.</para>

      <para>If your port requires some additional `patches' that are
	available on the Internet, fetch them too and put them in
	<makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>.  Do not worry if they come from a
	site other than where you got the main source tarball, we have
	a way to handle these situations (see the description of <link

	including the deletion, addition, or modification of files

    <sect1 id="slow-patch">
      <title>Patching</title>

      <para>In the preparation of the port, files that have been added
	or changed can be picked up with a &man.diff.1; for later
	feeding to &man.patch.1;.  Each patch you wish to apply should
	be saved into a file named
	<filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> where
	<replaceable>*</replaceable> indicates the pathname of the
	file that is patched, such as
	<filename>patch-Imakefile</filename> or
	<filename>patch-src-config.h</filename>.  These files should
	be stored in <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> (usually
	<filename>files/</filename>, from where they will be
	automatically applied.  All patches must be relative to
	<makevar>WRKSRC</makevar> (generally the directory your port's
	tarball unpacks itself into, that being where the build is
	done).  To make fixes and upgrades easier, you should avoid
	having more than one patch fix the same file (e.g.,
	<filename>patch-file</filename> and
	<filename>patch-file2</filename> both changing
	<filename><makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>/foobar.c</filename>).
	Note that if the path of a patched file contains an underscore
	(<literal>_</literal>) character, the patch needs to have two
	underscores instead in its name.  For example, to patch a file
	named <filename>src/freeglut_joystick.c</filename>, the
	corresponding patch should be named
	<filename>patch-src-freeglut__joystick.c</filename>.</para>

      <para>Please only use characters
	<literal>[-+._a-zA-Z0-9]</literal> for naming your patches.
	Do not use any other characters besides them.  Do not name
	your patches like <filename>patch-aa</filename> or
	<filename>patch-ab</filename> etc, always mention the path and
	file name in patch names.</para>

      <para>Do not put RCS strings in patches.  SVN will mangle them
	when we put the files into the ports tree, and when we check
	them out again, they will come out different and the patch
	will fail.  RCS strings are surrounded by dollar
	(<literal>&dollar;</literal>) signs, and typically start with
	<literal>&dollar;Id</literal> or
	<literal>&dollar;RCS</literal>.</para>

      <para>Using the recurse (<option>-r</option>) option to
	&man.diff.1; to generate patches is fine, but please take a
	look at the resulting patches to make sure you do not have any
	unnecessary junk in there.  In particular, diffs between two
	backup files, <filename>Makefile</filename>s when the port
	uses <command>Imake</command> or GNU
	<command>configure</command>, etc., are unnecessary and should
	be deleted.  If you had to edit
	<filename>configure.in</filename> and run
	<command>autoconf</command> to regenerate
	<command>configure</command>, do not take the diffs of
	<command>configure</command> (it often grows to a few thousand
	lines!); define <literal>USE_AUTOTOOLS=autoconf:261</literal>
	and take the diffs of
	<filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

      <para>Also, try to minimize the amount of non-functional
	whitespace changes in your patches.  It is common in the Open
	Source world for projects to share large amounts of a code
	base, but obey different style and indenting rules.  If you
	take a working piece of functionality from one project to fix
	similar areas in another, please be careful: the resulting
	line patch may be full of non-functional changes.  It not only
	increases the size of the SVN repository but makes it hard to
	find out what exactly caused the problem and what you changed
	at all.</para>

      <para>If you had to delete a file, then you can do it in the
	<maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target rather than as
	part of the patch.</para>

      <para>Simple replacements can be performed directly from the
	port <filename>Makefile</filename> using the in-place mode of
	&man.sed.1;.  This is very useful when you need to patch in a
	variable value.  Example:</para>

      <programlisting>post-patch:
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|for Linux|for FreeBSD|g' ${WRKSRC}/README
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|-pthread|${PTHREAD_LIBS}|' ${WRKSRC}/configure</programlisting>

      <para>Quite often, there is a situation when the software being
	ported, especially if it is primarily developed on &windows;,
	uses the CR/LF convention for most of its source files.  This
	may cause problems with further patching, compiler warnings,
	scripts execution (<command>/bin/sh^M</command> not found),
	etc.  To quickly convert all files from CR/LF to just LF, add
	<literal>USE_DOS2UNIX=yes</literal> to the port
	<filename>Makefile</filename>.  A list of files to convert can
	be specified:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_DOS2UNIX=	util.c util.h</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to convert a group of files across
	subdirectories, <makevar>DOS2UNIX_REGEX</makevar> can be used.
	Its argument is a <command>find</command> compatible regular
	expression.  More on the format is in &man.re.format.7;.  This
	option is useful for converting all files of a given
	extension, for example all source code files leaving binary
	files intact:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_DOS2UNIX=	yes
DOS2UNIX_REGEX=	.*\.(c|cpp|h)</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to create a patch file based off of an
	existing file, you can copy it with an
	<filename>.orig</filename> extension, and then modify the
	original one.  The <maketarget>makepatch</maketarget> target
	will write out an appropriate patch file to the <filename
	  class="directory">files</filename> directory of the
	port.</para>

      <para>If your port requires user input to build, configure, or

	    at all), and weigh that against that fact that it will

	  <title><makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar></title>

	  <para>From time to time a software vendor or FreeBSD porter
	    will do something silly and release a version of their
	    software which is actually numerically less than the
	    previous version.  An example of this is a port which goes
	    from foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be
	    incorrectly treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a
	    numerically greater value than 1).</para>

	  <para>In situations such as this, the
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> version should be increased.
	    If <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> is nonzero it is appended
	    to the package name as described in section 0 above.
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> must never be decreased or
	    reset to zero, because that would cause comparison to a
	    package from an earlier epoch to fail (i.e., the package
	    would not be detected as out of date): the new version
	    number (e.g., <literal>1.0,1</literal> in the above
	    example) is still numerically less than the previous
	    version (20000801), but the <literal>,1</literal> suffix
	    is treated specially by automated tools and found to be
	    greater than the implied suffix <literal>,0</literal> on
	    the earlier package.</para>

	  <para>Dropping or resetting <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar>
	    incorrectly leads to no end of grief; if you do not
	    understand the above discussion, please keep after it
	    until you do, or ask questions on the mailing
	    lists.</para>

	  <para>It is expected that <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> will
	    not be used for the majority of ports, and that sensible
	    use of <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> can often preempt it
	    becoming necessary if a future release of the software
	    should change the version structure.  However, care is
	    needed by FreeBSD porters when a vendor release is made
	    without an official version number &mdash; such as a code
	    <quote>snapshot</quote> release.  The temptation is to
	    label the release with the release date, which will cause
	    problems as in the example above when a new
	    <quote>official</quote> release is made.</para>

	  <para>For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date
	    20000917, and the previous version of the software was
	    version 1.2, the snapshot release should be given a
	    <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> of 1.2.20000917 or similar,
	    not 20000917, so that the succeeding release, say 1.3, is
	    still a numerically greater value.</para>

	<para>In some cases, several versions of a program may be

	<title>Package Naming Conventions</title>

	<para>The following are the conventions you should follow in
	  naming your packages.  This is to have our package directory
	  easy to scan, as there are already thousands of packages and
	  users are going to turn away if they hurt their eyes!</para>

	<para>The package name should look like
	  <filename><replaceable><optional>language<optional>_region</optional></optional>-name<optional><optional>-</optional>compiled.specifics</optional>-version.numbers</replaceable></filename>.</para>

	<para>The package name is defined as
	  <literal>${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}${PKGNAMESUFFIX}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>.
	  Make sure to set the variables to conform to that
	  format.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>FreeBSD strives to support the native language of
	      its users.  The <replaceable>language-</replaceable>
	      part should be a two letter abbreviation of the natural
	      language defined by ISO-639 if the port is specific to a
	      certain language.  Examples are <literal>ja</literal>
	      for Japanese, <literal>ru</literal> for Russian,
	      <literal>vi</literal> for Vietnamese,
	      <literal>zh</literal> for Chinese, <literal>ko</literal>
	      for Korean and <literal>de</literal> for German.</para>

	    <para>If the port is specific to a certain region within
	      the language area, add the two letter country code as
	      well.  Examples are <literal>en_US</literal> for US
	      English and <literal>fr_CH</literal> for Swiss
	      French.</para>

	    <para>The <replaceable>language-</replaceable> part should
	      be set in the <makevar>PKGNAMEPREFIX</makevar>
	      variable.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first letter of the <filename>name</filename>
	      part should be lowercase.  (The rest of the name may
	      contain capital letters, so use your own discretion when
	      you are converting a software name that has some capital
	      letters in it.) There is a tradition of naming
	      <literal>Perl 5</literal> modules by prepending
	      <literal>p5-</literal> and converting the double-colon
	      separator to a hyphen; for example, the
	      <literal>Data::Dumper</literal> module becomes
	      <literal>p5-Data-Dumper</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Make sure that the port's name and version are
	      clearly separated and placed into the
	      <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar> and
	      <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> variables.  The only
	      reason for <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar> to contain a
	      version part is if the upstream distribution is really
	      named that way, as in the
	      <filename>textproc/libxml2</filename> or
	      <filename>japanese/kinput2-freewnn</filename> ports.
	      Otherwise, the <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar> should not
	      contain any version-specific information.  It is quite
	      normal for several ports to have the same
	      <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar>, as the
	      <filename>www/apache*</filename> ports do; in that case,
	      different versions (and different index entries) are
	      distinguished by the <makevar>PKGNAMEPREFIX</makevar>,
	      <makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar>, and
	      <makevar>LATEST_LINK</makevar> values.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the port can be built with different <link
		linkend="makefile-masterdir">hardcoded defaults</link>
	      (usually part of the directory name in a family of
	      ports), the
	      <replaceable>-compiled.specifics</replaceable> part
	      should state the compiled-in defaults (the hyphen is
	      optional).  Examples are paper size and font
	      units.</para>

	    <para>The <replaceable>-compiled.specifics</replaceable>
	      part should be set in the
	      <makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar> variable.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The version string should follow a dash
	      (<literal>-</literal>) and be a period-separated list of
	      integers and single lowercase alphabetics.  In
	      particular, it is not permissible to have another dash
	      inside the version string.  The only exception is the
	      string <literal>pl</literal> (meaning
	      <quote>patchlevel</quote>), which can be used
	      <emphasis>only</emphasis> when there are no major and
	      minor version numbers in the software.  If the software
	      version has strings like <quote>alpha</quote>,
	      <quote>beta</quote>, <quote>rc</quote>, or
	      <quote>pre</quote>, take the first letter and put it
	      immediately after a period.  If the version string
	      continues after those names, the numbers should follow
	      the single alphabet without an extra period between
	      them.</para>

	    <para>The idea is to make it easier to sort ports by
	      looking at the version string.  In particular, make sure
	      version number components are always delimited by a
	      period, and if the date is part of the string, use the
	      <literal>0.0.<replaceable>yyyy</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>dd</replaceable></literal>
	      format, not
	      <literal><replaceable>dd</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></literal>
	      or the non-Y2K compliant
	      <literal><replaceable>yy</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>dd</replaceable></literal>
	      format.  It is important to prefix the version with
	      <literal>0.0.</literal> in case a release with an actual
	      version number is made, which would of course be
	      numerically less than
	      <literal><replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

      <sect2 id="choosing-categories">
	<title>Choosing the Right Category</title>

	<para>As many of the categories overlap, you often have to
	  choose which of the categories should be the primary
	  category of your port.  There are several rules that govern
	  this issue.  Here is the list of priorities, in decreasing
	  order of precedence:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first category must be a physical category (see
	      <link linkend="porting-categories">above</link>).  This
	      is necessary to make the packaging work.  Virtual
	      categories and physical categories may be intermixed
	      after that.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Language specific categories always come first.  For
	      example, if your port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then
	      your <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line would read
	      <filename>japanese x11-fonts</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Specific categories are listed before less-specific
	      ones.  For instance, an HTML editor should be listed as
	      <filename>www editors</filename>, not the other way
	      around.  Also, you should not list
	      <filename>net</filename> when the port belongs to any of
	      <filename>irc</filename>, <filename>mail</filename>,
	      <filename>news</filename>,
	      <filename>security</filename>, or
	      <filename>www</filename>, as <filename>net</filename> is
	      included implicitly.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>x11</filename> is used as a secondary
	      category only when the primary category is a natural
	      language.  In particular, you should not put
	      <filename>x11</filename> in the category line for X
	      applications.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><application>Emacs</application> modes should be
	      placed in the same ports category as the application
	      supported by the mode, not in
	      <filename>editors</filename>.  For example, an
	      <application>Emacs</application> mode to edit source
	      files of some programming language should go into
	      <filename>lang</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Ports which install loadable kernel modules should
	      have the virtual category <filename>kld</filename> in
	      their <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>misc</filename> should not appear with any
	      other non-virtual category.  If you have
	      <literal>misc</literal> with something else in your
	      <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line, that means you can
	      safely delete <literal>misc</literal> and just put the
	      port in that other subdirectory!</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If your port truly does not belong anywhere else,
	      put it in <filename>misc</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If you are not sure about the category, please put a
	  comment to that effect in your &man.send-pr.1; submission so
	  we can discuss it before we import it.  If you are a
	  committer, send a note to the &a.ports; so we can discuss it
	  first.  Too often, new ports are imported to the wrong
	  category only to be moved right away.  This causes
	  unnecessary and undesirable bloat in the master source
	  repository.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="proposing-categories">
	<title>Proposing a New Category</title>

	<para>As the Ports Collection has grown over time, various new
	  categories have been introduced.  New categories can either
	  be <emphasis>virtual</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that
	  do not have a corresponding subdirectory in the ports
	  tree&mdash; or <emphasis>physical</emphasis>
	  categories&mdash;those that do.  The following text
	  discusses the issues involved in creating a new physical
	  category so that you can understand them before you propose
	  one.</para>

	<para>Our existing practice has been to avoid creating a new
	  physical category unless either a large number of ports
	  would logically belong to it, or the ports that would belong
	  to it are a logically distinct group that is of limited
	  general interest (for instance, categories related to spoken
	  human languages), or preferably both.</para>

	<para>The rationale for this is that such a change creates a
	  <ulink url="&url.articles.committers-guide;/#ports"> fair
	    amount of work</ulink> for both the committers and also
	  for all users who track changes to the Ports Collection.  In
	  addition, proposed category changes just naturally seem to
	  attract controversy.  (Perhaps this is because there is no
	  clear consensus on when a category is <quote>too
	    big</quote>, nor whether categories should lend themselves
	  to browsing (and thus what number of categories would be an
	  ideal number), and so forth.)</para>

	<para>Here is the procedure:</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>Propose the new category on &a.ports;.  You should
	      include a detailed rationale for the new category,
	      including why you feel the existing categories are not
	      sufficient, and the list of existing ports proposed to
	      move.  (If there are new ports pending in
	      <application>GNATS</application> that would fit this
	      category, list them too.)  If you are the maintainer
	      and/or submitter, respectively, mention that as it may
	      help you to make your case.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Participate in the discussion.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If it seems that there is support for your idea,
	      file a PR which includes both the rationale and the list
	      of existing ports that need to be moved.  Ideally, this
	      PR should also include patches for the following:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for the
		  new ports once they are repocopied</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  new category</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  old ports' categories</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for ports
		  that depend on the old ports</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>(for extra credit, you can include the other
		  files that have to change, as per the procedure
		  in the Committer's Guide.)</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Since it affects the ports infrastructure and
	      involves not only performing repo-copies but also
	      possibly running regression tests on the build cluster,
	      the PR should be assigned to the &a.portmgr;.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If that PR is approved, a committer will need to
	      follow the rest of the procedure that is <ulink
		url="&url.articles.committers-guide;/article.html#PORTS">
		outlined in the Committer's Guide</ulink>.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>Proposing a new virtual category should be similar to
	  the above but much less involved, since no ports will
	  actually have to move.  In this case, the only patches to
	  include in the PR would be those to add the new category to
	  the <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> of the affected
	  ports.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="proposing-reorg">
	<title>Proposing Reorganizing All the Categories</title>

	<para>Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the
	  categories with either a 2-level structure, or some other
	  kind of keyword structure.  To date, nothing has come of any
	  of these proposals because, while they are very easy to
	  make, the effort involved to retrofit the entire existing
	  ports collection with any kind of reorganization is daunting
	  to say the very least.  Please read the history of these
	  proposals in the mailing list archives before you post this
	  idea; furthermore, you should be prepared to be challenged
	  to offer a working prototype.</para>

      <title>The Distribution Files</title>

      <para>The second part of the <filename>Makefile</filename>
	describes the files that must be downloaded in order to build
	the port, and where they can be downloaded from.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTVERSION/DISTNAME</makevar></title>

	<para><makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is the name of the port as
	  called by the authors of the software.
	  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> defaults to
	  <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>, so override
	  it only if necessary.  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is only
	  used in two places.  First, the distribution file list
	  (<makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>) defaults to
	  <makevar>${DISTNAME}</makevar><makevar>${EXTRACT_SUFX}</makevar>.
	  Second, the distribution file is expected to extract into a
	  subdirectory named <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>, which defaults
	  to
	  <filename>work/<makevar>${DISTNAME}</makevar></filename>.</para>

	<para>Some vendor's distribution names which do not fit into
	  the <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>-scheme can
	  be handled automatically by setting
	  <makevar>DISTVERSION</makevar>.
	  <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> and

	  but can of course be overridden.  The following table lists

	<title><makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar></title>

	<para>If you have one distribution file, and it uses an odd
	  suffix to indicate the compression mechanism, set
	  <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>.</para>

	<para>For example, if the distribution file was named
	  <filename>foo.tgz</filename> instead of the more normal
	  <filename>foo.tar.gz</filename>, you would write:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTNAME=	foo
EXTRACT_SUFX=	.tgz</programlisting>

	<para>The <makevar>USE_BZIP2</makevar>,
	  <makevar>USE_XZ</makevar> and
	  <makevar>USE_ZIP</makevar> variables automatically set
	  <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar> to
	  <literal>.tar.bz2</literal>, <literal>.tar.xz</literal>
	  or <literal>.zip</literal> as necessary.  If neither of
	  these are set then <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>
	  defaults to <literal>.tar.gz</literal>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>You never need to set both
	    <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar> and
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>.</para>
	</note>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>Sometimes the names of the files to be downloaded have
	  no resemblance to the name of the port.  For example, it
	  might be called <filename>source.tar.gz</filename> or
	  similar.  In other cases the application's source code might
	  be in several different archives, all of which must be
	  downloaded.</para>

	<para>If this is the case, set <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> to
	  be a space separated list of all the files that must be
	  downloaded.</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz source2.tar.gz</programlisting>

	<para>If not explicitly set, <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>

      <sect2 id="porting-patchfiles">
	<title><makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>If your port requires some additional patches that are
	  available by FTP or HTTP, set <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar>
	  to the names of the files and <makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar>
	  to the URL of the directory that contains them (the format
	  is the same as <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>).</para>

	<para>If the patch is not relative to the top of the source
	  tree (i.e., <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) because it contains
	  some extra pathnames, set
	  <makevar>PATCH_DIST_STRIP</makevar> accordingly.  For
	  instance, if all the pathnames in the patch have an extra
	  <literal>foozolix-1.0/</literal> in front of the filenames,
	  then set <literal>PATCH_DIST_STRIP=-p1</literal>.</para>

	<para>Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be
	  decompressed automatically if the filenames end with
	  <filename>.gz</filename> or <filename>.Z</filename>.</para>

	<para>If the patch is distributed with some other files, such
	  as documentation, in a <command>gzip</command>ped tarball,
	  you cannot just use <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar>.  If that
	  is the case, add the name and the location of the patch
	  tarball to <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  Then, use the
	  <makevar>EXTRA_PATCHES</makevar> variable to point to those
	  files and <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> will
	  automatically apply them for you.  In particular, do
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy patch files into the
	  <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> directory&mdash;that directory
	  may not be writable.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The tarball will have been extracted alongside the
	    regular source by then, so there is no need to explicitly
	    extract it if it is a regular <command>gzip</command>ped
	    or <command>compress</command>ed tarball.  If you do the
	    latter, take extra care not to overwrite something that
	    already exists in that directory.  Also, do not forget to
	    add a command to remove the copied patch in the
	    <maketarget>pre-clean</maketarget> target.</para>

	<title>Multiple Distribution Files or Patches from Different
	  Sites and Subdirectories
	  (<literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>)</title>

	<para>(Consider this to be a somewhat <quote>advanced
	    topic</quote>; those new to this document may wish to skip
	  this section at first).</para>

	<para>This section has information on the fetching mechanism
	  known as both <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> and
	  <literal>MASTER_SITES_NN</literal>.  We will refer to this
	  mechanism as <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>.</para>

	<para>A little background first.  OpenBSD has a neat feature
	  inside the <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> variables which allows files
	  and patches to be postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
	  identifiers.  Here, <literal>n</literal> can be both
	  <literal>[0-9]</literal> and denote a group designation.
	  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=	alpha:0 beta:1</programlisting>

	<para>In OpenBSD, distribution file <filename>alpha</filename>
	  will be associated with variable
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES0</makevar> instead of our common
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> and
	  <filename>beta</filename> with
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES1</makevar>.</para>

	<para>This is a very interesting feature which can decrease
	  that endless search for the correct download site.</para>

	<para>Just picture 2 files in <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  20 sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, the sites slow
	  as hell where <filename>beta</filename> is carried by all
	  sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, and
	  <filename>alpha</filename> can only be found in the 20th
	  site.  It would be such a waste to check all of them if the
	  maintainer knew this beforehand, would it not?  Not a good
	  start for that lovely weekend!</para>

	<para>Now that you have the idea, just imagine more
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and more
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  Surely our
	  <quote>distfiles survey meister</quote> would appreciate the
	  relief to network strain that this would bring.</para>

	<para>In the next sections, information will follow on the
	  FreeBSD implementation of this idea.  We improved a bit on
	  OpenBSD's concept.</para>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Simplified Information</title>

	  <para>This section tells you how to quickly prepare fine
	    grained fetching of multiple distribution files and
	    patches from different sites and subdirectories.  We
	    describe here a case of simplified
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> usage.  This will be
	    sufficient for most scenarios.  However, if you need
	    further information, you will have to refer to the next
	    section.</para>

	  <para>Some applications consist of multiple distribution
	    files that must be downloaded from a number of different
	    sites.  For example,
	    <application>Ghostscript</application> consists of the
	    core of the program, and then a large number of driver
	    files that are used depending on the user's printer.  Some
	    of these driver files are supplied with the core, but many
	    others must be downloaded from a variety of different
	    sites.</para>

	  <para>To support this, each entry in
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> may be followed by a colon
	    and a <quote>tag name</quote>.  Each site listed in
	    <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> is then followed by a
	    colon, and the tag that indicates which distribution files
	    should be downloaded from this site.</para>

	  <para>For example, consider an application with the source
	    split in two parts, <filename>source1.tar.gz</filename>
	    and <filename>source2.tar.gz</filename>, which must be
	    downloaded from two different sites.  The port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would include lines like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified Use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	      with One File Per Site</title>

	    <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	ftp://ftp.example1.com/:source1 \
		ftp://ftp.example2.com/:source2
DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz:source1 \
		source2.tar.gz:source2</programlisting>
	  </example>

	  <para>Multiple distribution files can have the same tag.
	    Continuing the previous example, suppose that there was a
	    third distfile, <filename>source3.tar.gz</filename>, that
	    should be downloaded from
	    <hostid>ftp.example2.com</hostid>.  The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would then be written like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified Use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	      with More Than One File Per Site</title>

	    <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	ftp://ftp.example1.com/:source1 \
		ftp://ftp.example2.com/:source2
DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz:source1 \

	  </example>

	  <title>Detailed Information</title>

	  <para>Okay, so the previous section example did not reflect
	    your needs?  In this section we will explain in detail
	    how the fine grained fetching mechanism
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> works and how you can
	    modify your ports to use it.</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements can be postfixed with
		<literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> where
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> is
		<literal>[^:,]+</literal>, i.e.,
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> could conceptually be any
		alphanumeric string but we will limit it to
		<literal>[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]+</literal> for
		now.</para>

	      <para>Moreover, string matching is case sensitive;
		i.e., <literal>n</literal> is different from
		<literal>N</literal>.</para>

	      <para>However, the following words cannot be used for
		postfixing purposes since they yield special meaning:
		<literal>default</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and
		<literal>ALL</literal> (they are used internally in
		item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-what-changes-in-port-targets">).
		Furthermore, <literal>DEFAULT</literal> is a special
		purpose word (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
		belong to the group <literal>n</literal>,
		<literal>:m</literal> belong to group
		<literal>m</literal> and so forth.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">
	      <para>Elements without a postfix are groupless, i.e.,
		they all belong to the special group
		<literal>DEFAULT</literal>.  If you postfix any
		elements with <literal>DEFAULT</literal>, you are just
		being redundant unless you want to have an element
		belonging to both <literal>DEFAULT</literal> and other
		groups at the same time (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">).</para>

	      <para>The following examples are equivalent but the
		first one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Groups are not exclusive, an element may belong to
		several different groups at the same time and a group
		can either have either several different elements or
		none at all.  Repeated elements within the same group
		will be simply that, repeated elements.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">
	      <para>When you want an element to belong to several
		groups at the same time, you can use the comma
		operator (<literal>,</literal>).</para>

	      <para>Instead of repeating it several times, each time
		with a different postfix, we can list several groups
		at once in a single postfix.  For instance,
		<literal>:m,n,o</literal> marks an element that
		belongs to group <literal>m</literal>,
		<literal>n</literal> and <literal>o</literal>.</para>

	      <para>All the following examples are equivalent but the
		last one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha alpha:SOME_SITE</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT alpha:SOME_SITE</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:SOME_SITE,DEFAULT</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT,SOME_SITE</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>All sites within a given group are sorted
		according to <makevar>MASTER_SORT_AWK</makevar>.  All
		groups within <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> and

		well.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-group-semantics">
	      <para>Group semantics can be used in any of the

		<makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar>,
		<makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar>,
		<makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar>,
		<makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>, and

		following syntax:</para>

	      <orderedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>All <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>,
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar>,
		    <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> and
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> elements must
		    be terminated with the forward slash
		    <literal>/</literal> character.  If any elements
		    belong to any groups, the group postfix
		    <literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>
		    must come right after the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal>.  The
		    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> mechanism relies
		    on the existence of the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal> to avoid confusing elements
		    where a <literal>:n</literal> is a valid part of
		    the element with occurrences where
		    <literal>:n</literal> denotes group
		    <literal>n</literal>.  For compatibility purposes,
		    since the <literal>/</literal> terminator was not
		    required before in both
		    <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> and
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> elements, if
		    the postfix immediate preceding character is not
		    a <literal>/</literal> then <literal>:n</literal>
		    will be considered a valid part of the element
		    instead of a group postfix even if an element is
		    postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>.  See both

	<para>Do not let your port clutter

	  <makevar>DIST_SUBDIR</makevar> to the name of the port
	  (<literal>${PORTNAME}</literal> or
	  <literal>${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}</literal> should work
	  fine).  This will change <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> from the

	  <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles/<makevar>DIST_SUBDIR</makevar></filename>,
	  and in effect puts everything that is required for your port

	<para>It will also look at the subdirectory with the same name
	  on the backup master site at

	<para>If your port uses binary distfiles and has a license

	  distributed in binary form, e.g., GPL,
	  <makevar>ALWAYS_KEEP_DISTFILES</makevar> will instruct the
	  &os; build cluster to keep a copy of the files specified in
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>.  Users of these ports will
	  generally not need these files, so it is a good idea to only
	  add the source distfiles to <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>
	  when <makevar>PACKAGE_BUILDING</makevar> is defined.</para>

      <para>Many ports depend on other ports.  This is a very

	variables for common cases, plus a few more to control the
	behavior of dependencies.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>LIB_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable specifies the shared libraries this port
	  depends on.  It is a list of
	  <replaceable>lib</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	  tuples where <replaceable>lib</replaceable> is the name of
	  the shared library, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the
	  directory in which to find it in case it is not available,
	  and <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the target to call
	  in that directory.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>LIB_DEPENDS=   jpeg:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg</programlisting>

	<para>will check for a shared jpeg library with any version,
	  and descend into the
	  <filename>graphics/jpeg</filename> subdirectory of your

	  <replaceable>target</replaceable> part can be omitted if it
	  is equal to <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar> (which
	  defaults to <literal>install</literal>).</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <replaceable>lib</replaceable> part is a regular
	    expression which is being looked up in the
	    <command>ldconfig -r</command> output.  Values such as
	    <literal>intl.9</literal> and <literal>intl.[5-7]</literal>

	</note>

	<para>The dependency is checked twice, once from within the
	  <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target and then from within
	  the <maketarget>install</maketarget> target.  Also, the name
	  of the dependency is put into the package so that

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  depends on during run-time.  It is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	  tuples where <replaceable>path</replaceable> is the name of
	  the executable or file, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is
	  the directory in which to find it in case it is not
	  available, and <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the
	  target to call in that directory.  If
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable> starts with a slash
	  (<literal>/</literal>), it is treated as a file and its
	  existence is tested with <command>test -e</command>;
	  otherwise, it is assumed to be an executable, and
	  <command>which -s</command> is used to determine if the
	  program exists in the search path.</para>

	<para>For example,</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${LOCALBASE}/news/bin/innd:${PORTSDIR}/news/inn \
		xmlcatmgr:${PORTSDIR}/textproc/xmlcatmgr</programlisting>

	<para>will check if the file or directory
	  <filename>/usr/local/news/bin/innd</filename> exists, and build
	  and install it from the <filename>news/inn</filename>
	  subdirectory of the ports tree if it is not found.  It will
	  also see if an executable called
	  <command>xmlcatmgr</command> is in the search path, and
	  descend into the <filename>textproc/xmlcatmgr</filename>
	  subdirectory of your ports tree to build and install it if
	  it is not found.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In this case, <command>innd</command> is actually an
	    executable; if an executable is in a place that is not
	    expected to be in the search path, you should use the full
	    pathname.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>The official search <envar>PATH</envar> used on the
	    ports build cluster is</para>

	  <programlisting>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin</programlisting>
	</note>

	<para>The dependency is checked from within the
	  <maketarget>install</maketarget> target.  Also, the name of
	  the dependency is put into the package so that
	  &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically install it if it is not
	  on the user's system.  The <replaceable>target</replaceable>
	  part can be omitted if it is the same as
	  <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar>.</para>

	<para>A quite common situation is when
	  <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar> is literally the same as
	  <makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar>, especially if ported
	  software is written in a scripted language or if it requires
	  the same build and run-time environment.  In this
	  case, it is both tempting and intuitive to directly
	  assign one to the other:</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${BUILD_DEPENDS}</programlisting>

	<para>However, such assignment can pollute run-time
	  dependencies with entries not defined in the port's original
	  <makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar>.  This happens because of
	  &man.make.1;'s lazy evaluation of variable assignment.
	  Consider a <filename>Makefile</filename> with
	  <makevar>USE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar>
	  variables, which are processed by
	  <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.*.mk</filename> to augment initial
	  build dependencies.  For example,
	  <literal>USE_GMAKE=yes</literal> adds <filename
	    role="package">devel/gmake</filename> to
	  <makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar>.  To prevent such
	  additional dependencies from polluting
	  <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar>, take care to assign with
	  expansion, i.e., expand the value before assigning it to the
	  variable:</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS:=	${BUILD_DEPENDS}</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  requires to build.  Like <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar>, it
	  is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	  tuples.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>BUILD_DEPENDS=	unzip:${PORTSDIR}/archivers/unzip</programlisting>

	<para>will check for an executable called
	  <command>unzip</command>, and descend into the
	  <filename>archivers/unzip</filename> subdirectory of your
	  ports tree to build and install it if it is not
	  found.</para>

	<note>
	  <para><quote>build</quote> here means everything from
	    extraction to compilation.  The dependency is checked from
	    within the <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target.  The
	    <replaceable>target</replaceable> part can be omitted if
	    it is the same as <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar></para>
	</note>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>FETCH_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  requires to fetch.  Like the previous two, it is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	  tuples.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>FETCH_DEPENDS=	ncftp2:${PORTSDIR}/net/ncftp2</programlisting>

	<para>will check for an executable called
	  <command>ncftp2</command>, and descend into the
	  <filename>net/ncftp2</filename> subdirectory of your ports
	  tree to build and install it if it is not found.</para>

	<para>The dependency is checked from within the
	  <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target.  The
	  <replaceable>target</replaceable> part can be omitted if it

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>EXTRACT_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  requires for extraction.  Like the previous, it is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	  tuples.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>EXTRACT_DEPENDS=	unzip:${PORTSDIR}/archivers/unzip</programlisting>

	<para>will check for an executable called
	  <command>unzip</command>, and descend into the
	  <filename>archivers/unzip</filename> subdirectory of your

	<para>The dependency is checked from within the

	<title>Notes on Dependencies</title>

	<para>As mentioned above, the default target to call when a
	  dependency is required is
	  <maketarget>DEPENDS_TARGET</maketarget>.  It defaults to
	  <literal>install</literal>.  This is a user variable; it is
	  never defined in a port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  If
	  your port needs a special way to handle a dependency, use
	  the <literal>:target</literal> part of the
	  <makevar>*_DEPENDS</makevar> variables instead of redefining
	  <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar>.</para>

	<para>When you type <command>make clean</command>, its
	  dependencies are automatically cleaned too.  If you do not
	  wish this to happen, define the variable
	  <makevar>NOCLEANDEPENDS</makevar> in your environment.  This
	  may be particularly desirable if the port has something that
	  takes a long time to rebuild in its dependency list, such as
	  KDE, GNOME or Mozilla.</para>

	</important>

	<para>The ports building technology does not tolerate circular
	  dependencies.  If you introduce one, you will have someone,
	  somewhere in the world, whose FreeBSD installation will
	  break almost immediately, with many others quickly to
	  follow.  These can really be hard to detect; if in doubt,
	  before you make that change, make sure you have done the
	  following: <command>cd /usr/ports; make index</command>.
	  That process can be quite slow on older machines, but you
	  may be able to save a large number of people&mdash;including
	  yourself&mdash; a lot of grief in the process.</para>

	<title>Problems Caused by Automatic Dependencies</title>

	<para>Dependencies must be declared either explicitly or by
	  using the <link
	    linkend="makefile-options">OPTIONS framework</link>.
	  Using other methods like automatic detection complicates
	  indexing, which causes problems for port and package
	  management.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Wrong Declaration of an Optional Dependency</title>

	  <programlisting>.include &lt;bsd.port.pre.mk&gt;

.if exists(${LOCALBASE}/bin/foo)
LIB_DEPENDS=	bar:${PORTSDIR}/foo/bar
.endif</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>The problem with trying to automatically add
	  dependencies is that files and settings outside an
	  individual port can change at any time.  For example: an
	  index is built, then a batch of ports are installed.  But
	  one of the ports installs the tested file.  The index is now
	  incorrect, because an installed port unexpectedly has a new
	  dependency.  The index may still be wrong even after
	  rebuilding if other ports also determine their need for
	  dependencies based on the existence of other files.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Correct Declaration of an Optional Dependency</title>

	  <programlisting>OPTIONS_DEFINE=	BAR
BAR_DESC=	Enable bar support

.include &lt;bsd.port.options.mk&gt;

.if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MBAR}
LIB_DEPENDS=	bar:${PORTSDIR}/foo/bar
.endif</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Testing option variables is the correct method.  It will
	  not cause inconsistencies in the index of a batch of ports,
	  provided the options were defined prior to the index build.
	  Simple scripts can then be used to automate the building,
	  installation, and updating of these ports and their
	  packages.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="use-want">
	<title><makevar>USE_</makevar> and
	  <makevar>WANT_</makevar></title>

	<para><makevar>USE_</makevar> variables are set by the port

	  port that needs Firefox would set</para>

	<programlisting>USE_FIREFOX=	yes</programlisting>

	<para>Some <makevar>USE_</makevar> variables can accept

	<para>For more control over dependencies in some cases,

	  This port needs some PHP modules, which are listed in the

    <sect1 id="makefile-masterdir">
      <title><makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar></title>

      <para>If your port needs to build slightly different versions of
	packages by having a variable (for instance, resolution, or
	paper size) take different values, create one subdirectory per
	package to make it easier for users to see what to do, but try
	to share as many files as possible between ports.  Typically
	you only need a very short <filename>Makefile</filename> in
	all but one of the directories if you use variables cleverly.
	In the sole <filename>Makefile</filename>, you can use
	<makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar> to specify the directory where
	the rest of the files are.  Also, use a variable as part of
	<link
	  linkend="porting-pkgname"><makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar></link>
	so the packages will have different names.</para>

      <para>This will be best demonstrated by an example.  This is
	part of <filename>japanese/xdvi300/Makefile</filename>;</para>

      <programlisting>PORTNAME=	xdvi
PORTVERSION=	17
PKGNAMEPREFIX=	ja-
PKGNAMESUFFIX=	${RESOLUTION}

	@${ECHO_MSG} "Possible values are: 118, 240, 300 (default) and 400."
	@${FALSE}
.endif</programlisting>

      <para><filename role="package">japanese/xdvi300</filename> also
	has all the regular patches, package files, etc.  If you type
	<command>make</command> there, it will take the default value
	for the resolution (300) and build the port normally.</para>

      <para>As for other resolutions, this is the
	<emphasis>entire</emphasis>
	<filename>xdvi118/Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>RESOLUTION=	118

      <para>(<filename>xdvi240/Makefile</filename> and

	subdirectories like <makevar>FILESDIR</makevar> and
	<makevar>SCRIPTDIR</makevar> are to be found under

    <sect1 id="makefile-manpages">
      <title>Man Pages</title>

      <para>The <makevar>MAN[1-9LN]</makevar> variables will

	<emphasis>not</emphasis> list manpages in the

	  linkend="plist-sub">generating PLIST</link> for more).  It
	also makes the install stage automatically compress or
	uncompress manpages depending on the setting of
	<makevar>NO_MANCOMPRESS</makevar> in
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>If your port tries to install multiple names for manpages
	using symlinks or hardlinks, you must use the
	<makevar>MLINKS</makevar> variable to identify these.  The
	link installed by your port will be destroyed and recreated by
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to make sure it points to the
	correct file.  Any manpages listed in MLINKS must not be
	listed in the <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>To specify whether the manpages are compressed upon
	installation, use the <makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar>
	variable.  This variable can take three values,
	<literal>yes</literal>, <literal>no</literal> and
	<literal>maybe</literal>.  <literal>yes</literal> means
	manpages are already installed compressed,
	<literal>no</literal> means they are not, and
	<literal>maybe</literal> means the software already respects
	the value of <makevar>NO_MANCOMPRESS</makevar> so
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> does not have to do anything
	special.</para>

      <para><makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar> is automatically set to
	<literal>yes</literal> if <makevar>USE_IMAKE</makevar> is set
	and <makevar>NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES</makevar> is not set, and to
	<literal>no</literal> otherwise.  You do not have to
	explicitly define it unless the default is not suitable for
	your port.</para>

      <para>If your port anchors its man tree somewhere other than
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, you can use the
	<makevar>MANPREFIX</makevar> to set it.  Also, if only
	manpages in certain sections go in a non-standard place, such
	as some <literal>perl</literal> modules ports, you can set
	individual man paths using
	<makevar>MAN<replaceable>sect</replaceable>PREFIX</makevar>
	(where <replaceable>sect</replaceable> is one of
	<literal>1-9</literal>, <literal>L</literal> or
	<literal>N</literal>).</para>

      <para>If your manpages go to language-specific subdirectories,
	set the name of the languages to <makevar>MANLANG</makevar>.
	The value of this variable defaults to <literal>""</literal>
	(i.e., English only).</para>

      <para>Here is an example that puts it all together.</para>

      <programlisting>MAN1=		foo.1
MAN3=		bar.3
MAN4=		baz.4
MLINKS=		foo.1 alt-name.8

      <para>Additionally
	<filename>${MANPREFIX}/man/man8/alt-name.8.gz</filename> may

	</note>

	<para>These variables are exported to
	  <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar>.  Their values will appear

	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar></filename> if possible.
	  That is,
	  <filename>share/doc/<makevar>PORTNAME</makevar></filename>
	  will be substituted for <literal>%%DOCSDIR%%</literal> in

%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT
%%PORTDOCS%%@dirrm %%DOCSDIR%%</programlisting>

	<para>As an alternative to enumerating the documentation files
	  in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, a port can set the
	  variable <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> to a list of file names
	  and shell glob patterns to add to the final packing list.
	  The names will be relative to <makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar>.
	  Therefore, a port that utilizes <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>
	  and uses a non-default location for its documentation should
	  set <makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar> accordingly.  If a directory
	  is listed in <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> or matched by a
	  glob pattern from this variable, the entire subtree of
	  contained files and directories will be registered in the

	  defined then files and directories listed in
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> would not be installed and
	  neither would be added to port packing list.  Installing the
	  documentation at <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> as shown above
	  remains up to the port itself.  A typical example of
	  utilizing <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> looks as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>PORTDOCS=	README.* ChangeLog docs/*</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>The equivalents of <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> for

	<para>Try to let the port put things in the right

	  everything except binaries, header files and manual pages in
	  a subdirectory of <filename>lib</filename>, which does not
	  work well with the BSD paradigm.  Many of the files should
	  be moved to one of the following: <filename>etc</filename>
	  (setup/configuration files), <filename>libexec</filename>
	  (executables started internally), <filename>sbin</filename>

    <title>Special Considerations</title>

    <para>There are some more things you have to take into account
      when you create a port.  This section explains the most common
      of those.</para>

    <sect1 id="porting-shlibs">
      <title>Shared Libraries</title>

      <para>If your port installs one or more shared libraries, define
	a <makevar>USE_LDCONFIG</makevar> make variable, which will
	instruct a <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to run
	<literal>&dollar;{LDCONFIG} -m</literal> on the directory
	where the new library is installed (usually
	<filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib</filename>) during
	<maketarget>post-install</maketarget> target to register it
	into the shared library cache.  This variable, when defined,
	will also facilitate addition of an appropriate
	<literal>@exec /sbin/ldconfig -m</literal> and
	<literal>@unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R</literal> pair into your
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> file, so that a user who
	installed the package can start using the shared library
	immediately and de-installation will not cause the system to
	still believe the library is there.</para>

      <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	yes</programlisting>

      <para>If you need, you can override the default directory by
	setting the <makevar>USE_LDCONFIG</makevar> value to a list of
	directories into which shared libraries are to be installed.
	For example if your port installs shared libraries into
	<filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/foo</filename> and
	<filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/bar</filename>
	directories you could use the following in your
	<filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	${PREFIX}/lib/foo ${PREFIX}/lib/bar</programlisting>

      <para>Please double-check, often this is not necessary at all or
	can be avoided through <literal>-rpath</literal> or setting
	<envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar> during linking (see <filename
	  role="package">lang/moscow_ml</filename> for an example), or
	through a shell-wrapper which sets
	<makevar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</makevar> before invoking the binary,
	like <filename role="package">www/seamonkey</filename>
	does.</para>

      <para>When installing 32-bit libraries on 64-bit system, use
	<makevar>USE_LDCONFIG32</makevar> instead.</para>

      <para>Try to keep shared library version numbers in the
	<filename>libfoo.so.0</filename> format.  Our runtime linker
	only cares for the major (first) number.</para>

      <para>When the major library version number increments in the
	update to the new port version, all other ports that link to
	the affected library should have their
	<makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> incremented, to force
	recompilation with the new library version.</para>

    <sect1 id="porting-restrictions">
      <title>Ports with Distribution Restrictions</title>

      <para>Licenses vary, and some of them place restrictions on how
	the application can be packaged, whether it can be sold for
	profit, and so on.</para>

      <important>
	<para>It is your responsibility as a porter to read the
	  licensing terms of the software and make sure that the
	  FreeBSD project will not be held accountable for violating
	  them by redistributing the source or compiled binaries
	  either via FTP/HTTP or CD-ROM.  If in doubt, please contact
	  the &a.ports;.</para>
      </important>

      <para>In situations like this, the variables described in the
	following sections can be set.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable indicates that we may not generate a
	  binary package of the application.  For instance, the
	  license may disallow binary redistribution, or it may
	  prohibit distribution of packages created from patched
	  sources.</para>

	<para>However, the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> may be
	  freely mirrored on FTP/HTTP.  They may also be distributed
	  on a CD-ROM (or similar media) unless
	  <makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> is set as well.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should also be used if the
	  binary package is not generally useful, and the application
	  should always be compiled from the source code.  For
	  example, if the application has configuration information
	  that is site specific hard coded in to it at compile time,
	  set <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the package should not be
	  generated.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable alone indicates that, although we are
	  allowed to generate binary packages, we may put neither
	  those packages nor the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>
	  onto a CD-ROM (or similar media) for resale.  However, the
	  binary packages and the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>
	  will still be available via FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para> If this variable is set along with
	  <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>, then only the port's
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> will be available, and only via
	  FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed
	  on CD-ROM.  For instance, this should be used if the port's
	  license is for <quote>non-commercial</quote> use
	  only.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>NOFETCHFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>Files defined in the <makevar>NOFETCHFILES</makevar>
	  variable are not fetchable from any of the
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  An example of such a file
	  is when the file is supplied on CD-ROM by the vendor.</para>

	<para>Tools which check for the availability of these files
	  on the <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> should ignore these
	  files and not report about them.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar></title>

	<para>Set this variable alone if the application's license
	  permits neither mirroring the application's
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> nor distributing the binary
	  package in any way.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> or
	  <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should not be set along with
	  <makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar> since the latter variable
	  implies the former ones.</para>

	<para><makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed.
	  Typically, this indicates that the port contains proprietary
	  software and that the user will need to manually download
	  the <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>, possibly after registering
	  for the software or agreeing to accept the terms of an
	  <acronym>EULA</acronym>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>RESTRICTED_FILES</makevar></title>

	<para>When <makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar> or
	  <makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> is set, this variable defaults
	  to <literal>${DISTFILES} ${PATCHFILES}</literal>, otherwise
	  it is empty.  If only some of the distribution files are
	  restricted, then set this variable to list them.</para>

	<para>Note that the port committer should add an entry to
	  <filename>/usr/ports/LEGAL</filename> for every listed
	  distribution file, describing exactly what the restriction
	  entails.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Examples</title>

	<para>The preferred way to state "the distfiles for this port

IGNORE=	may not be redistributed because of licensing reasons. Please visit <replaceable>some-website</replaceable> to accept their license and download ${DISTFILES} into ${DISTDIR}
.endif</programlisting>

	<para>This both informs the user, and sets the proper metadata
	  on the user's machine for use by automated programs.</para>

	<para>Shared libraries using the GNU building framework

      <title>Using GNU <literal>gettext</literal></title>

      <sect2>
	<title>Basic Usage</title>

	<para>If your port requires <literal>gettext</literal>,
	  just set <makevar>USE_GETTEXT</makevar> to
	  <literal>yes</literal>, and your port will grow the
	  dependency on <filename
	    role="package">devel/gettext</filename>.  The value of
	  <makevar>USE_GETTEXT</makevar> can also specify the required
	  version of the <literal>libintl</literal> library, the basic
	  part of <literal>gettext</literal>, but using this feature
	  is <emphasis>strongly discouraged</emphasis>: Your port
	  should work with just the current version of <filename
	    role="package">devel/gettext</filename>.</para>

	<para>A rather common case is a port using
	  <literal>gettext</literal> and <command>configure</command>.
	  Generally, GNU <command>configure</command> should be able
	  to locate <literal>gettext</literal> automatically.  If it
	  ever fails to, hints at the location of
	  <literal>gettext</literal> can be passed in
	  <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> and <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_GETTEXT=	yes
CPPFLAGS+=	-I${LOCALBASE}/include
LDFLAGS+=	-L${LOCALBASE}/lib

GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes
CONFIGURE_ENV=	CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS}" \
		LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS}"</programlisting>

	<para>Of course, the code can be more compact if there are no
	  more flags to pass to <command>configure</command>:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_GETTEXT=	yes
GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes
CONFIGURE_ENV=	CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
		LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Optional Usage</title>

	<para>Some software products allow for disabling NLS, e.g.,
	  through passing <option>--disable-nls</option> to
	  <command>configure</command>.  In that case, your port
	  should use <literal>gettext</literal> conditionally,
	  depending on the status of <link
	    linkend="knobs-without-nls"><makevar>WITHOUT_NLS</makevar></link>.
	  For ports of low to medium complexity, you can rely on the
	  following idiom:</para>

	<programlisting>GNU_CONFIGURE=		yes

.if !defined(WITHOUT_NLS)
USE_GETTEXT=		yes
PLIST_SUB+=		NLS=""
.else
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-nls
PLIST_SUB+=		NLS="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

	<para>The next item on your to-do list is to arrange so that
	  the message catalog files are included in the packing list
	  conditionally.  The <filename>Makefile</filename> part of
	  this task is already provided by the idiom.  It is explained
	  in the section on <link linkend="plist-sub">advanced
	    <filename>pkg-plist</filename> practices</link>.  In a
	  nutshell, each occurrence of <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> will be replaced by
	  <quote><literal>@comment&nbsp;</literal></quote> if NLS is
	  disabled, or by a null string if NLS is enabled.
	  Consequently, the lines prefixed by
	  <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> will become mere comments in the
	  final packing list if NLS is off; otherwise the prefix will
	  be just left out.  All you need to do now is insert
	  <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> before each path to a message
	  catalog file in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  For
	  example:</para>

	<programlisting>%%NLS%%share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo
%%NLS%%share/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo</programlisting>

	<para>In high complexity cases, you may need to use more
	  advanced techniques than the recipe given here, such as
	  <link linkend="plist-dynamic">dynamic packing list
	    generation</link>.</para>

	<title>Handling Message Catalog Directories</title>

	<para>There is a point to note about installing message
	  catalog files.  The target directories for them, which
	  reside under
	  <filename><makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar>/share/locale</filename>,
	  should rarely be created and removed by your port.  The most
	  popular languages have their respective directories listed
	  in <filename>/etc/mtree/BSD.local.dist</filename>; that is,
	  they are a part of the base system.  The directories for
	  many other languages are governed by the <filename
	    role="package">devel/gettext</filename> port.  You may
	  want to consult its <filename>pkg-plist</filename> and see
	  whether your port is going to install a message catalog file
	  for a unique language.</para>

	<title>Building with Ant</title>

	<para>When the port is to be built using Apache Ant, it has to
	  define <makevar>USE_ANT</makevar>.  Ant is thus considered
	  to be the sub-make command.  When no
	  <literal>do-build</literal> target is defined by the port, a
	  default one will be set that simply runs Ant according to
	  <makevar>MAKE_ENV</makevar>, <makevar>MAKE_ARGS</makevar>
	  and <makevar>ALL_TARGET</makevar>.  This is similar to the
	  <makevar>USE_GMAKE</makevar> mechanism, which is documented
	  in <xref linkend="building">.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="java-best-practices">
	<title>Best Practices</title>

	<para>When porting a Java library, your port should install
	  the JAR file(s) in <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>, and
	  everything else under
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> (except for
	  the documentation, see below).  In order to reduce the
	  packing file size, you may reference the JAR file(s)
	  directly in the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Just use the
	  following statement (where <filename>myport.jar</filename>
	  is the name of the JAR file installed as part of the
	  port):</para>

	<programlisting>PLIST_FILES+=	%%JAVAJARDIR%%/myport.jar</programlisting>

	<para>When porting a Java application, the port usually
	  installs everything under a single directory (including its
	  JAR dependencies).  The use of
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> is strongly
	  encouraged in this regard.  It is up the porter to decide
	  whether the port should install the additional JAR
	  dependencies under this directory or directly use the
	  already installed ones (from
	  <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>).</para>

	<para>Regardless of the type of your port (library or
	  application), the additional documentation should be
	  installed in the <link linkend="install-documentation">same
	  location</link> as for any other port.  The JavaDoc tool is
	  known to produce a different set of files depending on the
	  version of the JDK that is used.  For ports that do not
	  enforce the use of a particular JDK, it is therefore a
	  complex task to specify the packing list
	  (<filename>pkg-plist</filename>).  This is one reason why
	  porters are strongly encouraged to use the
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> macro.  Moreover, even if you
	  can predict the set of files that will be generated by
	  <command>javadoc</command>, the size of the resulting
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> advocates for the use of
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>.</para>

	<para>The default value for <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> is
	  <filename>${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}</filename>.  It is a
	  good idea to override <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> to
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> for Java
	  ports.  Indeed, <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> is automatically
	  added to <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar> (documented in <xref
	    linkend="plist-sub">) so you may use
	  <literal>%%DATADIR%%</literal> directly in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>As for the choice of building Java ports from source or
	  directly installing them from a binary distribution, there
	  is no defined policy at the time of writing.  However,
	  people from the <ulink
	    url="http://www.freebsd.org/java/">&os; Java
	  Project</ulink> encourage porters to have their ports built
	  from source whenever it is a trivial task.</para>

	<para>All the features that have been presented in this
	  section are implemented in <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.
	  If you ever think that your port needs more sophisticated
	  Java support, please first have a look at the <ulink
	    url="http://svn.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.java.mk?view=markup">bsd.java.mk
	    SVN log</ulink> as it usually takes some time
	  to document the latest features.  Then, if you think the
	  support you are lacking would be beneficial to many other
	  Java ports, feel free to discuss it on the &a.java;.</para>

	<para>Although there is a <literal>java</literal> category for
	  PRs, it refers to the JDK porting effort from the &os; Java
	  project.  Therefore, you should submit your Java port in the
	  <literal>ports</literal> category as for any other port,
	  unless the issue you are trying to resolve is related to
	  either a JDK implementation or
	  <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.</para>

	<para>Similarly, there is a defined policy regarding the
	  <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> of a Java port, which is
	  detailed in <xref linkend="makefile-categories">.</para>

	  url="&url.books.handbook;/configtuning-rcd.html">the rc.d

	Finally, there is <ulink url="&url.articles.rc-scripting">an
	  article</ulink> on practical aspects of
	<filename>rc.d</filename> scripting.</para>

      <para>One or more <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts can be

      <programlisting>USE_RC_SUBR=	doormand</programlisting>

      <para>Scripts must be placed in the <filename>files</filename>
	subdirectory and a <literal>.in</literal> suffix must be added
	to their filename.  Standard <makevar>SUB_LIST</makevar>
	expansions will be used for this file.  Use of the

	encouraged as well.  More on <makevar>SUB_LIST</makevar> in
	<link
	  linkend="using-sub-files">the relevant

      <para>Prior to &os;&nbsp;6.1-RELEASE, integration with

	<makevar>USE_RCORDER</makevar> instead of
	<makevar>USE_RC_SUBR</makevar>.  However, use of this method
	is not necessary unless the port has an option to install
	itself in the base, or the service needs to run prior to the
	<filename>FILESYSTEMS</filename> <filename>rc.d</filename>
	script in the base.</para>

      <para>As of &os;&nbsp;6.1-RELEASE, local
	<filename>rc.d</filename> scripts (including those installed

# KEYWORD: shutdown
#
# Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf
# to enable this service:
#
# doormand_enable (bool):	Set to NO by default.
#				Set it to YES to enable doormand.
# doormand_config (path):	Set to %%PREFIX%%/etc/doormand/doormand.cf

      <para>If the service runs as a particular user (other than root)
	this is mandatory.</para>

      <programlisting>KEYWORD: shutdown</programlisting>

      <para>is included in the script above because the mythical port
	we are using as an example starts a service, and should be
	shut down cleanly when the system shuts down.  If the script
	is not starting a persistent service this is not
	necessary.</para>

      <para>For optional configuration elements the &quot;=&quot;
	style of default variable assignment is preferable to the
	&quot;:=&quot; style here, since the former sets a default
	value only if the variable is unset, and the latter sets one
	if the variable is unset <emphasis>or</emphasis> null.  A user
	might very well include something like</para>

      <programlisting>doormand_flags=""</programlisting>

      <para>in their <filename>rc.conf.local</filename> file, and a
	variable substitution using &quot;:=&quot; would
	inappropriately override the user's intention.  The
	<literal>_enable</literal> variable is not optional,
	and should use the &quot;:&quot; for the default.</para>

	<title>Stopping Services at Deinstall</title>

	<para>It is possible to have a service stopped automatically

	  feature only when it is absolutely necessary to stop a
	  service before its files go away.  Usually, it is up to the
	  administrator's discretion to decide, whether to stop the
	  service on deinstall or not.  Also note this affects
	  upgrades, too.</para>

	<title>Pre-Commit Checklist</title>

	<para>Before contributing a port with an
	  <filename>rc.d</filename> script, and more importantly,
	  before committing one, please consult the following
	  checklist to be sure that it is ready.</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>If this is a new file, does it have
	      <filename>.sh</filename> in the file name?  If so that
	      should be changed to just <filename>file.in</filename>
	      since new <filename>rc.d</filename> files may not end
	      with that extension.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the file have a
	      <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal> tag?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Do the name of the file (minus
	      <filename>.in</filename>), the
	      <literal>PROVIDE</literal> line, and
	      <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	      all match?  The file name matching
	      <literal>PROVIDE</literal> makes debugging easier,
	      especially for &man.rcorder.8; issues.  Matching the
	      file name and
	      <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	      makes it easier to figure out which variables are
	      relevant in <filename>rc.conf[.local]</filename>.  The
	      latter is also what you might call &ldquo;policy&rdquo;
	      for all new scripts, including those in the base
	      system.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Is the <literal>REQUIRE</literal> line set to
	      <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  This is mandatory for scripts
	      that run as a non-root user.  If it runs as root, is
	      there a good reason for it to run prior to
	      <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  If not, it should run there
	      so that we can loosely group local scripts to a point in
	      &man.rcorder.8; after most everything in the base is
	      already running.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script start a persistent service?  If so,
	      it should have <literal>KEYWORD:
		shutdown</literal>.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>

	    <para>Make sure there is no <literal>KEYWORD:
		FreeBSD</literal> present.  This has not been
	      necessary or desirable for years.  It is also an
	      indication that the new script was copy/pasted from an
	      old script, so extra caution should be given to the
	      review.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If the script uses an interpreted language like
	      <command>perl</command>, <command>python</command>, or
	      <command>ruby</command>, make certain that
	      <varname>command_interpreter</varname> is set
	      appropriately.  Otherwise,</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service <replaceable>name</replaceable> stop</userinput></screen>

	    <para>will probably not work properly.  See
	      &man.service.8; for more information.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Have all occurrences of
	      <filename>/usr/local</filename> been replaced with
	      <literal>%%PREFIX%%</literal>?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Do the default variable assignments come after
	      <function>load_rc_config</function>?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are there default assignments to empty strings?
	      They should be removed, but double-check that the option
	      is documented in the comments at the top of the
	      file.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are things that are set in variables actually used
	      in the script?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are options listed in the default
	      <replaceable>name</replaceable><varname>_flags</varname>
	      things that are actually mandatory?  If so, they should
	      be in <varname>command_args</varname>.  The
	      <option>-d</option> option is a red flag (pardon the
	      pun) here, since it is usually the option to
	      &ldquo;daemonize&rdquo; the process, and therefore is
	      actually mandatory.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The
	      <replaceable>name</replaceable><varname>_flags</varname>
	      variable should never be included in
	      <varname>command_args</varname> (and vice versa,
	      although that error is less common).</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script execute any code unconditionally?
	      This is frowned on.  Usually these things can/should be
	      dealt with through a
	      <function>start_precmd</function>.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>All boolean tests should utilize the
	      <function>checkyesno</function> function.  No
	      hand-rolled tests for <literal>[Yy][Ee][Ss]</literal>,
	      etc.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If there is a loop (for example, waiting for
	      something to start) does it have a counter to terminate
	      the loop?  We do not want the boot to be stuck forever
	      if there is an error.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script create files or directories that
	      need specific permissions, for example, a
	      <filename>pid</filename> file that needs to be owned by
	      the user that runs the process?  Rather than the
	      traditional &man.touch.1;/&man.chown.8;/&man.chmod.1;
	      routine, consider using &man.install.1; with the proper
	      command line arguments to do the whole procedure with
	      one step.</para>

	<literal>perl</literal>, in the case of <literal>p5-</literal>
	ports).  To make this easy, any instances in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> of
	<literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>, <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>,
	and <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> will be substituted
	for appropriately.  The value of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>
	is the numeric revision of the operating system (e.g.,
	<literal>4.9</literal>).  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal>
	and <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal> is the full version number
	of <command>perl</command> (e.g., <literal>5.8.9</literal>).
	Several other
	<literal>%%<replaceable>VARS</replaceable>%%</literal> related
	to port's documentation files are described in <link
	  linkend="install-documentation">the relevant
	  section</link>.</para>

      <para>If you need to make other substitutions, you can set the
	<makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar> variable with a list of
	<literal><replaceable>VAR</replaceable>=<replaceable>VALUE</replaceable></literal>
	pairs and instances of
	<literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal> will be
	substituted with <replaceable>VALUE</replaceable> in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>For instance, if you have a port that installs many files
	in a version-specific subdirectory, you can put something
	like</para>

      <programlisting>OCTAVE_VERSION=	2.0.13
PLIST_SUB=	OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

      <para>in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use
	<literal>%%OCTAVE_VERSION%%</literal> wherever the version
	shows up in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That way, when
	you upgrade the port, you will not have to change dozens (or
	in some cases, hundreds) of lines in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>If your port installs files conditionally on the options
	set in the port, the usual way of handling it is prefixing the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> lines with a
	<literal>%%TAG%%</literal> and adding that
	<literal>TAG</literal> to the <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar>
	variable inside the <filename>Makefile</filename> with a
	special value of <literal>@comment</literal>, which makes
	package tools to ignore the line:</para>

      <programlisting>.if defined(WITH_X11)
PLIST_SUB+=	X11=""
.else
PLIST_SUB+=	X11="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

      <para>and in the <filename>pkg-plist</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>%%X11%%bin/foo-gui</programlisting>

      <para>This substitution (as well as addition of any <link
	  linkend="makefile-manpages">manual pages</link>) will be
	done between the <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget> and
	<maketarget>do-install</maketarget> targets, by reading from
	<filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename> and writing to
	<filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename> (default:
	<filename><makevar>WRKDIR</makevar>/.PLIST.mktmp</filename>).
	So if your port builds
	<filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename> on the fly, do
	so in or before <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget>.  Also,
	if your port needs to edit the resulting file, do so in
	<maketarget>post-install</maketarget> to a file named
	<filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename>.</para>

      <para>Another possibility to modify port's packing list is based
	on setting the variables <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	<makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>.  The value of each variable is
	regarded as a list of pathnames to write to
	<filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename> along with
	<filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename> contents.  Names
	listed in <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	<makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> are subject to
	<literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal>
	substitution, as described above.  Except for that, names from
	<makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> will appear in the final
	packing list unchanged, while <literal>@dirrm</literal> will
	be prepended to names from <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>.  To
	take effect, <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	<makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> must be set before
	<filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename> is written,
	i.e., in <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget> or
	earlier.</para>

	<para>Empty directories created during port installation need

      <para>If your port installs configuration files to
	<filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/etc</filename> (or
	elsewhere) do <emphasis>not</emphasis> simply list them in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That will cause
	&man.pkg.delete.1; to remove the files carefully edited by
	the user, and a re-installation will wipe them out.</para>

      <para>Instead, install sample file(s) with a
	<filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>
	suffix.  Then copy the sample file to the real configuration
	file name, if it does not already exist.  On deinstall
	delete the configuration file, but only if it is identical
	to the <filename>.sample</filename> file.
	You need to handle this both in the port
	<filename>Makefile</filename>, and in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> (for installation from the
	package).</para>

      <para>Example of the <filename>Makefile</filename> part:</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	@if [ ! -f ${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf ]; then \
		${CP} -p ${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf.sample ${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf ; \

      <para>For each configuration file, create the following three

      <programlisting>@unexec if cmp -s %D/etc/orbit.conf.sample %D/etc/orbit.conf; then rm -f %D/etc/orbit.conf; fi
etc/orbit.conf.sample
@exec if [ ! -f %D/etc/orbit.conf ] ; then cp -p %D/%F %B/orbit.conf; fi</programlisting>

      <para>The order of these lines is important.  On deinstallation,
	the sample file is compared to the actual configuration file.
	If these files are identical, no changes have been made by the
	user and the actual file can be safely deleted.  Because the
	sample file must still exist for the comparison, the
	<literal>@unexec</literal> line comes before the sample
	configuration file name.  On installation, if an actual
	configuration file is not already present, the sample file is
	copied to the actual file.  The sample file must be present
	before it can be copied, so the <literal>@exec</literal> line
	comes after the sample configuration file name.</para>

      <para>To debug any issues, temporarily remove the
	<literal>-s</literal> flag to &man.cmp.1; for more

      <para>See &man.pkg.create.1; for more information on
	<literal>%D</literal> and related substitution markers.</para>

      <para>If there is a very good reason not to install a working

      <title>Dynamic Versus Static Package List</title>

      <para>A <emphasis>static package list</emphasis> is a package
	list which is available in the Ports Collection either as a
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> file (with or without variable
	substitution), or embedded into the
	<filename>Makefile</filename> via
	<makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	<makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>.  Even if the contents are
	auto-generated by a tool or a target in the Makefile
	<emphasis>before</emphasis> the inclusion into the Ports
	Collection by a committer, this is still considered a static
	list, since it is possible to examine it without having to
	download or compile the distfile.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>dynamic package list</emphasis> is a package
	list which is generated at the time the port is compiled based
	upon the files and directories which are installed.  It is not
	possible to examine it before the source code of the ported
	application is downloaded and compiled, or after running a
	<literal>make clean</literal>.</para>

      <para>While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden,
	maintainers should use static package lists wherever possible,
	as it enables users to &man.grep.1; through available ports to
	discover, for example, which port installs a certain file.
	Dynamic lists should be primarily used for complex ports where
	the package list changes drastically based upon optional
	features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package
	list is infeasible), or ports which change the package list
	based upon the version of dependent software used (e.g., ports
	which generate docs with
	<application>Javadoc</application>).</para>

      <para>Maintainers who prefer dynamic package lists are
	encouraged to add a new target to their port which generates
	the <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file so that users may
	examine the contents.</para>

    <sect1 id="plist-autoplist">
      <title>Automated Package List Creation</title>

      <para>First, make sure your port is almost complete, with only
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> missing.</para>

      <para>Next, create a temporary directory tree into which your

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mtree -U -f `make -V MTREE_FILE` -d -e -p /var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME` && find -d * \! -type d) | sort &gt; pkg-plist</userinput></screen>

      <para>You must also add any newly created directories to the

      <para>Finally, you need to tidy up the packing list by hand; it
	is not <emphasis>all</emphasis> automated.  Manual pages
	should be listed in the port's <filename>Makefile</filename>
	under <makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar>, and
	not in the package list.  User configuration files should be
	removed, or installed as
	<filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>.
	The <filename>info/dir</filename> file should not be listed
	and appropriate <filename>install-info</filename> lines should
	be added as noted in the <link linkend="makefile-info">info
	  files</link> section.  Any libraries installed by the port
	should be listed as specified in the <link

	section.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, use the <command>plist</command> script in
	<filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/</filename> to build the

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install PREFIX=/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput></screen>

      <para>The packing list still has to be tidied up by hand as

      <title>Running <command>make describe</command></title>

      <para>Several of the &os; port maintenance tools, such as
	&man.portupgrade.1;, rely on a database called
	<filename>/usr/ports/INDEX</filename> which keeps track of
	such items as port dependencies.  <filename>INDEX</filename>
	is created by the top-level
	<filename>ports/Makefile</filename> via <command>make
	  index</command>, which descends into each port subdirectory
	and executes <command>make describe</command> there.  Thus, if
	<command>make describe</command> fails in any port, no one can
	generate <filename>INDEX</filename>, and many people will
	quickly become unhappy.</para>

      <note>
	<para>It is important to be able to generate this file no
	  matter what options are present in
	  <filename>make.conf</filename>, so please avoid doing things
	  such as using <literal>.error</literal> statements when (for
	  instance) a dependency is not satisfied.  (See <xref
	    linkend="dads-dot-error">.)</para>
      </note>

      <para>If <command>make describe</command> produces a string
	rather than an error message, you are probably safe.  See
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> for the meaning of the
	string produced.</para>

      <para>Also note that running a recent version of
	<command>portlint</command> (as specified in the next section)
	will cause <command>make describe</command> to be run
	automatically.</para>

      <para>Since <command>portlint</command> uses heuristics to

      <para><command>port</command> is the front-end script, which can
	help you simplify the testing job.  Whenever you want to test
	a new port or update an existing one, you can use
	<command>port test</command> to test your port, including the
	<link

	checking.  This command also detects and lists any files that

    <sect1 id="porting-prefix">
      <title><makevar>PREFIX</makevar> and
	<makevar>DESTDIR</makevar></title>

      <para><makevar>PREFIX</makevar> determines where the port will
	be installed.  It defaults to <filename>/usr/local</filename>,
	but can be set by the user to a custom path like
	<filename>/opt</filename>.  Your port must respect the value
	of this variable.</para>

      <para><makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>, if set by the user, determines
	the complete alternative environment, usually a jail or an
	installed system mounted somewhere other than
	<filename>/</filename>.  A port will actually install into
	<filename><makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>/<makevar>PREFIX</makevar></filename>,
	and register with the package database in
	<filename><makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>/var/db/pkg</filename>.
	As <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar> is handled automatically by the
	ports infrastructure with &man.chroot.8;, you do not need any
	modifications or any extra care to write
	<makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>-compliant ports.</para>

      <para>The value of <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> will be set to
	<makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> (defaulting to
	<filename>/usr/local</filename>).  If
	<makevar>USE_LINUX_PREFIX</makevar> is set,
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar> will be <makevar>LINUXBASE</makevar>
	(defaulting to <filename>/compat/linux</filename>).</para>

      <para>Avoiding hard-coded <filename>/usr/local</filename> paths
	in the source makes the port much more flexible and able to
	cater to the needs of other sites.  Often, this can be
	accomplished by simply replacing occurrences of
	<filename>/usr/local</filename> in the port's various
	<filename>Makefile</filename>s with
	<literal>&dollar;{PREFIX}</literal>.  This variable is
	automatically passed down to every stage of the build and
	install processes.</para>

      <para>Make sure your application is not installing things in
	<filename>/usr/local</filename> instead of
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>.  A quick test for such hard-coded
	paths is:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make clean; make package PREFIX=/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput></screen>

      <para>If anything is installed outside of
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, the package creation process will
	complain that it cannot find the files.</para>

      <para>This test will not find hard-coded paths inside the
	port's files, nor will it verify that
	<makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> is being used to correctly refer
	to files from other ports.  The temporarily-installed port in
	<filename>/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</filename> should be
	tested for proper operation to make sure there
	are no problems with paths.</para>

      <para><makevar>PREFIX</makevar> should not be set explicitly
	in a port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Users installing
	the port may have set <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> to a custom
	location, and the port should respect that setting.</para>

      <para>Refer to programs and files from other ports with the
	variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For
	instance, if your port requires a macro
	<literal>PAGER</literal> to have the full pathname of
	<command>less</command>, do not use a literal path of
	<filename>/usr/local/bin/less</filename>.  Instead, use
	<literal>&dollar;{LOCALBASE}</literal>:</para>

      <programlisting>-DPAGER=\"&dollar;{LOCALBASE}/bin/less\"</programlisting>

      <para>The path with <makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> is more likely
	to still work if the system administrator has moved the whole
	<filename>/usr/local</filename> tree somewhere else.</para>

  <chapter id="port-upgrading">
    <title>Upgrading an Individual Port</title>

    <para>When you notice that a port is out of date compared to the
      latest version from the original authors, you should first
      ensure that you have the latest port.  You can find them in the
      <filename>ports/ports-current</filename> directory of the &os;
      FTP mirror sites.  However, if you are working with more than a
      few ports, you will probably find it easier to use
      <application>CVSup</application> to keep your whole ports
      collection up-to-date, as described in the <ulink
	url="&url.books.handbook;/synching.html#CVSUP-CONFIG">Handbook</ulink>.
      This will have the added benefit of tracking all the ports'
      dependencies.</para>

    <para>The next step is to see if there is an update already
      pending.  To do this, you have two options.  There is a
      searchable interface to the <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
      FreeBSD Problem Report (PR) database</ulink> (also known as
      <literal>GNATS</literal>).  Select <literal>ports</literal> in
      the dropdown, and enter the name of the port.</para>

    <para>However, sometimes people forget to put the name of the port
      into the Synopsis field in an unambiguous fashion.  In that
      case, you can try the <link linkend="portsmon"> FreeBSD Ports
	Monitoring System</link> (also known as
      <literal>portsmon</literal>).  This system attempts to classify
      port PRs by portname.  To search for PRs about a particular
      port, use the <ulink
	url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">
	Overview of One Port</ulink>.</para>

    <para>If there is no pending PR, the next step is to send an email
      to the port's maintainer, as shown by <command>make
	maintainer</command>.  That person may already be working on
      an upgrade, or have a reason to not upgrade the port right now
      (because of, for example, stability problems of the new
      version); you would not want to duplicate their work.  Note that
      unmaintained ports are listed with a maintainer of
      <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>, which is just the general
      ports mailing list, so sending mail there probably will not help
      in this case.</para>

    <para>If the maintainer asks you to do the upgrade or there is
      no maintainer, then you have a chance to help out &os; by
      preparing the update yourself!  Please do this by using the
      &man.diff.1; command in the base system.</para>

    <para>To create a suitable <command>diff</command> for a single
      patch, copy the file that needs patching to
      <replaceable>something.orig</replaceable>, save your changes to
      <replaceable>something</replaceable> and then create your
      patch:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>/usr/bin/diff something.orig something > something.diff</userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Otherwise, you should either use the <command>svn
	diff</command> method (<xref linkend="svn-diff">) or copy the
      contents of the port to an entire different directory and use
      the result of the recursive &man.diff.1; output of the new and
      old ports directories (e.g., if your modified port directory is
      called <filename>superedit</filename> and the original is in our
      tree as <filename>superedit.bak</filename>, then save the result
      of <command>diff -ruN superedit.bak superedit</command>).
      Either unified or context diff is fine, but port committers
      generally prefer unified diffs.  Note the use of the
      <literal>-N</literal> option&mdash;this is the accepted way to
      force diff to properly deal with the case of new files being
      added or old files being deleted.  Before sending us the diff,
      please examine the output to make sure all the changes make
      sense.  (In particular, make sure you first clean out the work
      directories with <command>make clean</command>).</para>

    <para>To simplify common operations with patch files, you can use
      <filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/patchtool.py</filename>.
      Before using it, please read
      <filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/README.patchtool</filename>.</para>

    <para>If the port is unmaintained, and you are actively using
      it yourself, please consider volunteering to become its
      maintainer.  &os; has over 4000 ports without maintainers, and
      this is an area where more volunteers are always needed.  (For a
      detailed description of the responsibilities of maintainers,
      refer to the section in the <ulink
	url="&url.books.developers-handbook;/policies.html#POLICIES-MAINTAINER">
	Developer's Handbook</ulink>.)</para>

    <para> The best way to send us the diff is by including it via
      &man.send-pr.1; (category <literal>ports</literal>).  If you are
      maintaining the port, be sure to put <literal>[maintainer
      update]</literal> at the beginning of your synopsis line and set
      the <quote>Class</quote> of your PR to
      <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  Otherwise, the
      <quote>Class</quote> of your PR should be
      <literal>change-request</literal>.  Please mention any added or
      deleted files in the message, as they have to be explicitly
      specified to &man.svn.1; when doing a commit.  If the diff is
      more than about 20KB, please compress and uuencode it;
      otherwise, just include it in the PR as is.</para>

    <para>Before you &man.send-pr.1;, you should review the
      <ulink url="&url.articles.problem-reports;/pr-writing.html">
      Writing the problem report</ulink> section in the Problem
      Reports article; it contains far more information about how to
      write useful problem reports.</para>

    <important>
      <para>If your upgrade is motivated by security concerns or a
	serious fault in the currently committed port, please notify
	the &a.portmgr; to request immediate rebuilding and
	redistribution of your port's package.  Unsuspecting users
	of &man.pkg.add.1; will otherwise continue to install the
	old version via <command>pkg_add -r</command> for several
	weeks.</para>
    </important>

    <note>
      <para>Once again, please use &man.diff.1; and not &man.shar.1;

    <title>Ports Security</title>

    <sect1 id="security-intro">
      <title>Why Security is So Important</title>

      <para>Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software.
	Arguably, the most dangerous of them are those opening
	security vulnerabilities.  From the technical viewpoint,
	such vulnerabilities are to be closed by exterminating
	the bugs that caused them.  However, the policies for
	handling mere bugs and security vulnerabilities are
	very different.</para>

      <para>A typical small bug affects only those users who have
	enabled some combination of options triggering the bug.
	The developer will eventually release a patch followed
	by a new version of the software, free of the bug, but
	the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading
	immediately because the bug has never vexed them.  A
	critical bug that may cause data loss represents a graver
	issue.  Nevertheless, prudent users know that a lot of
	possible accidents, besides software bugs, are likely to
	lead to data loss, and so they make backups of important
	data; in addition, a critical bug will be discovered
	really soon.</para>

      <para>A security vulnerability is all different.  First,
	it may remain unnoticed for years because often it does
	not cause software malfunction.  Second, a malicious party
	can use it to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable
	system, to destroy or alter sensitive data; and in the
	worst case the user will not even notice the harm caused.
	Third, exposing a vulnerable system often assists attackers
	to break into other systems that could not be compromised
	otherwise.  Therefore closing a vulnerability alone is
	not enough: the audience should be notified of it in most
	clear and comprehensive manner, which will allow to
	evaluate the danger and take appropriate actions.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="security-fix">
      <title>Fixing Security Vulnerabilities</title>

      <para>While on the subject of ports and packages, a security
	vulnerability may initially appear in the original
	distribution or in the port files.  In the former case, the
	original software developer is likely to release a patch or a
	new version instantly, and you will only need to update the
	port promptly with respect to the author's fix.  If the fix is
	delayed for some reason, you should either <link
	  linkend="dads-noinstall">mark the port as
	<makevar>FORBIDDEN</makevar></link> or introduce a patch file
	of your own to the port.  In the case of a vulnerable port,
	just fix the port as soon as possible.  In either case, <link
	  linkend="port-upgrading">the standard procedure for
	submitting your change</link> should be followed unless you
	have rights to commit it directly to the ports tree.</para>

      <important>
	<para>Being a ports committer is not enough to commit to
	  an arbitrary port.  Remember that ports usually have
	  maintainers, whom you should respect.</para>
      </important>

      <para>Please make sure that the port's revision is bumped
	as soon as the vulnerability has been closed.
	That is how the users who upgrade installed packages
	on a regular basis will see they need to run an update.
	Besides, a new package will be built and distributed
	over FTP and WWW mirrors, replacing the vulnerable one.
	<makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> should be bumped unless
	<makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> has changed in the course
	of correcting the vulnerability.  That is you should
	bump <makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> if you have added a
	patch file to the port, but you should not if you have updated
	the port to the latest software version and thus already
	touched <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar>.  Please refer to the
	<link linkend="makefile-naming-revepoch">corresponding
	  section</link> for more information.</para>

      <title>Keeping the Community Informed</title>

      <sect2 id="security-notify-vuxml-db">
	<title>The VuXML Database</title>

	<para>A very important and urgent step to take as early after
	  a security vulnerability is discovered as possible is to
	  notify the community of port users about the jeopardy.  Such
	  notification serves two purposes.  First, should the danger
	  be really severe it will be wise to apply an instant
	  workaround.  E.g., stop the affected network service or even
	  deinstall the port completely until the vulnerability is
	  closed.  Second, a lot of users tend to upgrade installed
	  packages only occasionally.  They will know from the
	  notification that they <emphasis>must</emphasis> update the
	  package without delay as soon as a corrected version is
	  available.</para>

	<para>Given the huge number of ports in the tree
	  a security advisory cannot be issued on each incident
	  without creating a flood and losing the attention of
	  the audience when it comes to really serious
	  matters.  Therefore security vulnerabilities found in
	  ports are recorded in <ulink
	    url="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
	  database</ulink>.  The Security Officer Team members
	  also monitor it for issues requiring their
	  intervention.</para>

	<para>If you have committer rights you can update the VuXML
	  database by yourself.  So you will both help the Security
	  Officer Team and deliver the crucial information to the
	  community earlier.  However, if you are not a committer,
	  or you believe you have found an exceptionally severe
	  vulnerability please do not hesitate to
	  contact the Security Officer Team directly as described
	  on the <ulink
	    url="http://www.freebsd.org/security/#how">FreeBSD
	    Security Information</ulink> page.</para>

	<para>The VuXML database is an
	  XML document.  Its source file <filename>vuln.xml</filename>
	  is kept right inside the port <filename
	    role="package">security/vuxml</filename>.  Therefore
	  the file's full pathname will be
	  <filename><envar>PORTSDIR</envar>/security/vuxml/vuln.xml</filename>.
	  Each time you discover a security vulnerability in a
	  port please add an entry for it to that file.
	  Until you are familiar with VuXML, the best thing you can
	  do is to find an existing entry fitting your case, then copy
	  it and use it as a template.</para>

	<title>A Short Introduction to VuXML</title>

	<para>The full-blown XML format is complex, and far beyond the
	  scope of this book.  However, to gain basic insight on the
	  structure of a VuXML entry you need only the notion of tags.
	  XML tag names are enclosed in angle brackets.  Each opening
	  &lt;tag&gt; must have a matching closing &lt;/tag&gt;.  Tags
	  may be nested.  If nesting, the inner tags must be closed
	  before the outer ones.  There is a hierarchy of tags, i.e.
	  more complex rules of nesting them.  Sounds very similar to
	  HTML, doesn't it?  The major difference is that XML is
	  e<emphasis>X</emphasis>tensible, i.e., based on defining
	  custom tags.  Due to its intrinsic structure XML puts
	  otherwise amorphous data into shape.  VuXML is particularly
	  tailored to mark up descriptions of security
	  vulnerabilities.</para>

	<para>Now let's consider a realistic VuXML entry:</para>

      <programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199103))</programlisting>

      <para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.3 Net2 code
	base or newer (e.g., FreeBSD 1.x, 4.3/Reno, NetBSD 0.9,
	386BSD, BSD/386 1.1 and below).</para>

      <para>Use:</para>

      <programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199306))</programlisting>

      <para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.4 code base
	or newer (e.g., FreeBSD 2.x, 4.4, NetBSD 1.0, BSD/386 2.0 or
	above).</para>

      <para>The value of the <literal>BSD</literal> macro is
	<literal>199506</literal> for the 4.4BSD-Lite2 code base.
	This is stated for informational purposes only.  It should not
	be used to distinguish between versions of FreeBSD based only
	on 4.4-Lite versus versions that have merged in changes from
	4.4-Lite2.  The <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> macro should be
	used instead.</para>

      <para>Use sparingly:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined in all
	    versions of FreeBSD.  Use it if the change you are making
	    <emphasis>only</emphasis> affects FreeBSD.  Porting
	    gotchas like the use of <literal>sys_errlist[]</literal>
	    versus <function>strerror()</function> are Berkeley-isms,
	    not FreeBSD changes.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In FreeBSD 2.x, <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is
	    defined to be <literal>2</literal>.  In earlier versions,
	    it is <literal>1</literal>.  Later versions always bump it
	    to match their major version number.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you need to tell the difference between a FreeBSD
	    1.x system and a FreeBSD 2.x or above system, usually the
	    right answer is to use the <literal>BSD</literal> macros
	    described above.  If there actually is a FreeBSD specific
	    change (such as special shared library options when using
	    <command>ld</command>) then it is OK to use
	    <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> and <literal>#if
	      __FreeBSD__ &gt; 1</literal> to detect a FreeBSD 2.x and
	    later system.  If you need more granularity in detecting
	    FreeBSD systems since 2.0-RELEASE you can use the
	    following:</para>

	  <programlisting>#if __FreeBSD__ &gt;= 2
#include &lt;osreldate.h&gt;
#    if __FreeBSD_version &gt;= 199504
	 /* 2.0.5+ release specific code here */
#    endif
#endif</programlisting>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In the hundreds of ports that have been done, there have
	only been one or two cases where
	<literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> should have been used.  Just
	because an earlier port screwed up and used it in the wrong
	place does not mean you should do so too.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as
	  <quote>2.2.5-STABLE</quote> after the 2.2.5-RELEASE.  The
	  pattern used to be year followed by the month, but we
	  decided to change it to a more straightforward major/minor
	  system starting from 2.2.  This is because the parallel
	  development on several branches made it infeasible to
	  classify the releases simply by their real release dates.
	  If you are making a port now, you do not have to worry about
	  old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for your
	  reference.</para>

	<acronym>OS</acronym>.  If timestamps are really needed,
	determine how precise they have to be and use an
	<acronym>API</acronym> which is documented to just deliver the
	needed precision.</para>

      <para>A number of simple syscalls (for example
	&man.gettimeofday.2;, &man.getpid.2;) are much faster on
	&linux; than on any other operating system due to caching and
	the vsyscall performance optimizations.  Do not rely on them
	being cheap in performance-critical applications.  In general,
	try hard to avoid syscalls if possible.</para>

      <para>Do not rely on &linux;-specific socket behaviour.  In
	particular, default socket buffer sizes are different (call
	&man.setsockopt.2; with <literal>SO_SNDBUF</literal> and
	<literal>SO_RCVBUF</literal>, and while &linux;'s &man.send.2;
	blocks when the socket buffer is full, &os;'s will fail and
	set <literal>ENOBUFS</literal> in errno.</para>

      <para>If relying on non-standard behaviour is required,
	encapsulate it properly into a generic <acronym>API</acronym>,
	do a check for the behaviour in the configure stage, and stop
	if it is missing.</para>

      <para>Check the <ulink
	  url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">man pages</ulink> to
	see if the function used is a <acronym>POSIX</acronym>
	interface (in the <quote>STANDARDS</quote> section of the man
	page).</para>

      <para>Do not assume that <filename>/bin/sh</filename> is
	<application>bash</application>.  Ensure that a command line
	passed to &man.system.3; will work with a
	<acronym>POSIX</acronym> compliant shell.</para>

      <para>A list of common <application>bash</application>isms is
	available <ulink
	  url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh">here</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Do not <literal>#include
	  <filename>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</filename></literal> if
	<filename>inttypes.h</filename> is sufficient.  This will
	ensure that the software builds on older versions of
	&os;.</para>

      <para>Check that headers are included in the
	<acronym>POSIX</acronym> or man page recommended way, e.g.
	<filename>sys/types.h</filename> is often forgotten, which is
	not as much of a problem for &linux; as it is for &os;.</para>

      <para>Compile threaded applications with
	<quote>-pthread</quote>, not <quote>-lpthread</quote> or
	variations thereof.</para>

  <chapter id="keeping-up">
    <title>Keeping Up</title>

    <para>The &os; Ports Collection is constantly changing.  Here is
      some information on how to keep up.</para>

    <sect1 id="freshports">
      <title>FreshPorts</title>

      <para>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have
	already been committed is by subscribing to <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts</ulink>.  You
	can select multiple ports to monitor.  Maintainers are
	strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive
	notification of not only their own changes, but also any
	changes that any other &os; committer has made.  (These are
	often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying
	ports framework&mdash;although it would be most polite to
	receive an advance heads-up from those committing such
	changes, sometimes this is overlooked or just simply
	impractical.  Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor
	in nature.  We expect everyone to use their best judgement in
	these cases.)</para>

      <para>If you wish to use FreshPorts, all you need is an account.
	If your registered email address is
	<literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, you will see the opt-in link
	on the right hand side of the webpages.  For those of you who
	already have a FreshPorts account, but are not using your
	<literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal> email address, just change
	your email to <literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, subscribe, then
	change it back again.</para>

      <para>FreshPorts also has a sanity test feature which
	automatically tests each commit to the FreeBSD ports tree.  If
	subscribed to this service, you will be notified of any errors
	which FreshPorts detects during sanity testing of your
	commits.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="svnweb">
      <title>The Web Interface to the Source Repository</title>

      <para>It is possible to browse the files in the source
	repository by using a web interface.  Changes that affect the
	entire port system are now documented in the <ulink
	  url="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/CHANGES">CHANGES</ulink>
	file.  Changes that affect individual ports
	are now documented in the <ulink
	  url="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/UPDATING">UPDATING</ulink>
	file.  However, the definitive answer to
	any question is undoubtedly to read the source code of <ulink
	  url="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.port.mk">bsd.port.mk</ulink>,
	and associated files.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="ports-mailling-list">
      <title>The &os; Ports Mailing List</title>

      <para>If you maintain ports, you should consider following the
	&a.ports;.  Important changes to the way ports work will be
	announced there, and then committed to
	<filename>CHANGES</filename>.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="build-cluster">
      <title>The &os; Port Building Cluster on
	<hostid role="hostname">pointyhat.FreeBSD.org</hostid></title>

      <para>One of the least-publicized strengths of &os; is that
	an entire cluster of machines is dedicated to continually
	building the Ports Collection, for each of the major OS
	releases and for each Tier-1 architecture.  You can find
	the results of these builds at <ulink
	  url="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/">package building logs
	  and errors</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Individual ports are built unless they are specifically
	marked with <makevar>IGNORE</makevar>.  Ports that are
	marked with <makevar>BROKEN</makevar> will still be attempted,
	to see if the underlying problem has been resolved.  (This
	is done by passing <makevar>TRYBROKEN</makevar> to the
	port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.)</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="distfile-survey">
      <title>Portscout: the &os; Ports Distfile Scanner</title>

      <para>The build cluster is dedicated to building the latest
	release of each port with distfiles that have already been
	fetched.  However, as the Internet continually changes,
	distfiles can quickly go missing.  <ulink
	  url="http://portscout.org">Portscout</ulink>, the &os;
	Ports distfile scanner, attempts to query every download site
	for every port to find out if each distfile is still
	available.  <application>Portscout</application> can generate
	<acronym>HTML</acronym> reports and send emails about newly
	available ports to those who request them.  Unless not
	otherwise subscribed, maintainers are asked to check
	periodically for changes, either by hand or using the
	<acronym>RSS</acronym> feed.</para>

      <para><application>Portscout</application>'s first page gives
	the email address of the port maintainer, the number of ports
	the maintainer is responsible for, the number of those ports
	with new distfiles, and the percentage of those ports that are
	out-of-date.  The search function allows for searching by
	email address for a specific maintainer, and for selecting
	whether or not only out-of-date ports should be shown.</para>

      <para>Upon clicking on a maintainer's email address,
	a list of all of their ports is displayed, along with port
	category, current version number, whether or not there is a
	new version, when the port was last updated, and finally when
	it was last checked.  A search function on this page allows
	the user to search for a specific port.</para>

      <para>Clicking on a port name in the list displays the
	<ulink url="http://freshports.org">FreshPorts</ulink> port
	information.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="portsmon">
      <title>The &os; Ports Monitoring System</title>

      <para>Another handy resource is the <ulink
	  url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org"> FreeBSD Ports Monitoring
	  System</ulink> (also known as <literal>portsmon</literal>).
	This system comprises a database that processes information
	from several sources and allows it to be browsed via a web
	interface.  Currently, the ports Problem Reports (PRs), the
	error logs from the build cluster, and individual files from
	the ports collection are used.  In the future, this will be
	expanded to include the distfile survey, as well as other
	sources.</para>

      <para>To get started, you can view all information about a
	particular port by using the <ulink
	  url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">
	  Overview of One Port</ulink>.</para>

      <para>As of this writing, this is the only resource available
	that maps GNATS PR entries to portnames.  (PR submitters do
	not always include the portname in their Synopsis, although we
	would prefer that they did.)  So, <literal>portsmon</literal>
	is a good place to start if you want to find out whether an
	existing port has any PRs filed against it and/or any build
	errors; or, to find out if a new port that you may be thinking
	about creating has already been submitted.</para>

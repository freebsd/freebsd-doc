      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD ports collection is the way almost everyone
	installs applications ("ports") on FreeBSD.  Like everything
	else about FreeBSD, it is primarily a volunteer effort.
	It is important to keep this in mind when reading this
	document.</para>

      <para>In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer
	to maintain an existing port if it is unmaintained&mdash;you
	do not need any special commit privileges to do so.</para>

    </chapter>

    <chapter id="own-port">
      <title>Making a port yourself</title>

      <para>So, you are interested in making your own port or
	upgrading an existing one?  Great!</para>

      <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
	FreeBSD.  If you want to upgrade an existing port, you should
	read this and then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading">.</para>

      <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed, you should
	refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which
	all port Makefiles include.  Even if you do not hack Makefiles
	daily, it is well commented, and you will still gain much
	knowledge from it.  Additionally, you may send specific questions
	to the &a.ports;.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Only a fraction of the variables
	  (<makevar><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></makevar>) that can be
	  overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not all)
	  are documented at the start of <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>;
	  the others probably ought to be.
	  Note that this file uses a non-standard tab setting:
	  <application>Emacs</application> and
	  <application>Vim</application> should recognize the setting on
	  loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and
	  &man.ex.1; can be set to use the correct value by
	  typing <command>:set tabstop=4</command> once the file has been
	  loaded.</para>

    <chapter id="quick-porting">
      <title>Quick Porting</title>

      <para>This section tells you how to do a quick port.  In many cases, it
	is not sufficient, so you will have to read further on into
	the document.</para>

      <para>First, get the original tarball and put it into
	<makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>, which defaults to
	<filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The following assumes that the software compiled out-of-the-box,
	  i.e., there was absolutely no change required for the port to work
	  on your FreeBSD box.  If you needed to change something, you will
	  have to refer to the next section too.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-makefile">
	<title>Writing the <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

	<para>The minimal <filename>Makefile</filename> would look something
	  like this:</para>

	  ports tree.  You can find a more detailed example in the <link
	    linkend="porting-samplem">sample Makefile</link> section.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="porting-desc">
	<title>Writing the description files</title>

	<para>There are two description files that are required for
	  any port, whether they actually package or not. They are
	  <filename>pkg-descr</filename> and
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  Their
	  <filename>pkg-</filename> prefix distinguishes them from
	  other files.</para>

	<sect2>
	  <title><filename>pkg-descr</filename></title>

	  <para>This is a longer description of the port.  One to a few
	    paragraphs concisely explaining what the port does is
	    sufficient.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a manual or an in-depth
	      description on how to use or compile the port! <emphasis>Please
	      be careful if you are copying from the
	      <filename>README</filename> or manpage</emphasis>; too often
	      they are not a concise description of the port or are in an
	      awkward format (e.g., manpages have justified spacing).  If the
	      ported software has an official WWW homepage, you should list it
	      here.  Prefix <emphasis>one</emphasis> of the websites with
	      <literal>WWW:</literal> so that automated tools will work
	      correctly.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The following example shows how your
	    <filename>pkg-descr</filename> should look:</para>

	  <programlisting>This is a port of oneko, in which a cat chases a poor mouse all over
the screen.
 :
(etc.)

WWW: http://www.oneko.org/</programlisting>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title><filename>pkg-plist</filename></title>

	  <para>This file lists all the files installed by the port.  It is
	    also called the <quote>packing list</quote> because the package is
	    generated by packing the files listed here.  The pathnames are
	    relative to the installation prefix (usually
	    <filename>/usr/local</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>).  If you are using the
	    <makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar> variables (as
	    you should be), do not list any manpages here.  If the port creates
	    directories during installation, make sure to add
	    <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines to remove them when the package is
	    deleted.</para>

	  <para>Here is a small example:</para>

	  <programlisting>bin/oneko
lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	  <para>Refer to the &man.pkg.create.1; manual page for details on the
	    packing list.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>It is recommended that you keep all the filenames in this
	      file sorted alphabetically.  It will make verifying the changes
	      when you upgrade the port much easier.</para>
	  </note>

	  <note>
	    <para>Creating a packing list manually can be a very tedious
	      task.  If the port installs a large numbers of files, <link
		linkend="plist-autoplist">creating the packing list
		automatically</link> might save time.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>There is only one case when <filename>pkg-plist</filename>
	    can be omitted from a port.  If the port installs just a handful
	    of files, and perhaps directories, the files and directories may
	    be listed in the variables <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	    <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>, respectively, within the port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For instance, we could get along
	    without <filename>pkg-plist</filename> in the above
	    <filename>oneko</filename> port by adding the
	    following lines to the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>PLIST_FILES=    bin/oneko \
                lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko \
                lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm \
                lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm \
                lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
PLIST_DIRS=     lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	  <para>Of course, <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> should be left
	    unset if a port installs no directories of its own.</para>

	  <para>The price for this way of listing port's files and
	    directories is that you cannot use command sequences
	    described in &man.pkg.create.1;.  Therefore, it is suitable
	    only for simple ports and makes them even simpler.  At the
	    same time, it has the advantage of reducing the number of files
	    in the ports collection.  Please consider using this technique
	    before you resort to <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Later we will see how <filename>pkg-plist</filename>
	    and <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> can be used to fulfil
	    <link linkend="plist">more sophisticated
	    tasks</link>.</para>

	<title>Creating the checksum file</title>

	<para>Just type <command>make makesum</command>. The ports make rules
	  will automatically generate the file
	  <filename>distinfo</filename>.</para>

	<para>If a file fetched has its checksum changed regularly and you are
	  certain the source is trusted (i.e. it comes from manufacturer CDs
	  or documentation generated daily), you should specify these files in
	  the <makevar>IGNOREFILES</makevar> variable.
	  Then the checksum is not calculated for that file when you run
	  <command>make makesum</command>, but set to
	  <literal>IGNORE</literal>.</para>

      <para>Ok, so it was not that simple, and the port required some

      <sect1 id="slow-work">
	<title>How things work</title>

	<para>First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when the user

	<procedure>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is run.  The
	      <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is responsible for making
	      sure that the tarball exists locally in
	      <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>. If <maketarget>fetch</maketarget>
	      cannot find the required files in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> it
	      will look up the URL <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, which is

		url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/"></ulink>,
	      where we put sanctioned distfiles as backup.  It will then
	      attempt to fetch the named distribution file with

	      the file in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> for future use and
	      proceed.</para>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target is run.  It
	      looks for your port's distribution file (typically a gzip'd
	      tarball) in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> and unpacks it into a

	    </orderedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>build</maketarget> target is run.  This is
	      responsible for descending into the port's private working
	      directory (<makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) and building it.  If
	      <makevar>USE_GMAKE</makevar> is set, GNU <command>make</command>
	      will be used, otherwise the system <command>make</command> will
	      be used.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>The above are the default actions.  In addition, you can define
	  targets
	  <maketarget>pre-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget> or
	  <maketarget>post-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>,
	  or put scripts with those names, in the <filename>scripts</filename>
	  subdirectory, and they will be run before or after the default
	  actions are done.</para>

	<para>For example, if you have a <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget>
	  target defined in your <filename>Makefile</filename>, and a file
	  <filename>pre-build</filename> in the <filename>scripts</filename>
	  subdirectory, the <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target will
	  be called after the regular extraction actions, and the
	  <filename>pre-build</filename> script will be executed before the
	  default build rules are done.  It is recommended that you use
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> targets if the actions are simple
	  enough, because it will be easier for someone to figure out what
	  kind of non-default action the port requires.</para>

	<para>The default actions are done by the
	  <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> targets
	  <maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>.
	  For example, the commands to extract a port are in the target
	  <maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>.  If you are not happy with the
	  default target, you can fix it by redefining the
	  <maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>
	  target in your <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <quote>main</quote> targets (e.g.,
	    <maketarget>extract</maketarget>,
	    <maketarget>configure</maketarget>, etc.) do nothing more than
	    make sure all  the stages up to that one are completed and call
	    the real targets or scripts, and they are not intended to be
	    changed.  If you want to fix the extraction, fix
	    <maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>, but never ever change
	    the way <maketarget>extract</maketarget> operates!</para>

	<para>Now that you understand what goes on when the user types

      <sect1 id="slow-sources">
	<title>Getting the original sources</title>

	<para>Get the original sources (normally) as a compressed tarball
	  (<filename><replaceable>foo</replaceable>.tar.gz</filename> or

	<para>If you cannot find a FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected to the

	  <hostid>freefall</hostid> account.
	  Ask the person who commits your port to do this.

	<para>If your port's distfile changes all the time without any

	  consider putting the distfile on your home page and listing it as
	  the first <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  If you can, try
	  to talk the port author out of doing this; it
	  really does help to establish some kind of source code control.

	<para>If your port requires some additional `patches' that are

	<title>Patching</title>

	<para>In the preparation of the port, files that have been added or
	  changed can be picked up with a &man.diff.1;
	  for later feeding to &man.patch.1;.  Each patch you
	  wish to apply should be saved into a file named
	  <filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> where
	  <replaceable>*</replaceable> indicates
	  the pathname of the file that is patched,
	  such as <filename>patch-Imakefile</filename> or
	  <filename>patch-src-config.h</filename>.  These files should
	  be stored in <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar>
	  (usually <filename>files/</filename>, from where they will be
	  automatically applied.  All patches must be relative to
	  <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar> (generally the directory your port's
	  tarball unpacks itself into, that being where the build is done).
	  To make fixes and upgrades easier, you should avoid having more than
	  one patch fix the same file (e.g., <filename>patch-file</filename> and
	  <filename>patch-file2</filename> both changing
	  <filename><makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>/foobar.c</filename>).</para>

	<para>Please only use characters <literal>[-+._a-zA-Z0-9]</literal> for
	  naming your patches.  Do not use any other characters besides them.
	  Do not name your patches like <filename>patch-aa</filename> or
	  <filename>patch-ab</filename> etc, always mention path and file name
	  in patch names.</para>

	<para>Do not put RCS strings in patches.  CVS will mangle them when we
	  put the files into the ports tree, and when we check them out again,
	  they will come out different and the patch will fail.  RCS strings
	  are surrounded by dollar (<literal>&dollar;</literal>) signs, and
	  typically start with <literal>&dollar;Id</literal> or
	  <literal>&dollar;RCS</literal>.</para>

	<para>Using the recurse (<option>-r</option>) option to
	  &man.diff.1; to generate patches is fine, but please take
	  a look at the resulting patches to make sure you do not have any
	  unnecessary junk in there.  In particular, diffs between two backup
	  files, <filename>Makefile</filename>s when the port uses
	  <command>Imake</command> or GNU <command>configure</command>, etc.,
	  are unnecessary and should be deleted.  If you had to edit
	  <filename>configure.in</filename> and run
	  <command>autoconf</command> to regenerate
	  <command>configure</command>, do not take the diffs of
	  <command>configure</command> (it often grows to a few thousand
	  lines!); define <literal>USE_AUTOTOOLS=autoconf:253</literal> and take the
	  diffs of <filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

	<para>If you had to delete a file, then you can do it in the
	  <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target rather than as part of
	  the patch.</para>

	<para>Simple replacements can be performed directly from the port
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> using the in-place mode of
	  &man.sed.1;.  This is very useful when you need to patch in
	  a variable value. Example:</para>

	<programlisting>post-patch:
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|for Linux|for FreeBSD|g' ${WRKSRC}/README
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|-pthread|${PTHREAD_LIBS}|' ${WRKSRC}/configure</programlisting>

	<para>Quite often, there is a situation when the software being
	  ported, especially if it is primarily developed on &windows;, uses
	  the CR/LF convention for most of its source files.  This may cause
	  problems with further patching, compiler warnings, scripts
	  execution (<command>/bin/sh^M</command> not found), etc.  To
	  quickly convert all files from CR/LF to just LF, add
	  <literal>USE_DOS2UNIX=yes</literal> to the port
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>.  A list of files to convert can
	  be specified:</para>

	  <title><makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar></title>

	  <para>From time to time a software vendor or FreeBSD porter
	    will do something silly and release a version of their
	    software which is actually numerically less than the
	    previous version. An example of this is a port which goes
	    from foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be
	    incorrectly treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a
	    numerically greater value than 1).</para>

	  <para>In situations such as this, the
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> version should be increased.
	    If <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> is nonzero it is appended
	    to the package name as described in section 0 above.
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> must never be decreased or reset
	    to zero, because that would cause comparison to a package
	    from an earlier epoch to fail (i.e. the package would not
	    be detected as out of date): the new version number (e.g.
	    <literal>1.0,1</literal> in the above example) is still
	    numerically less than the previous version (20000801), but
	    the <literal>,1</literal> suffix is treated specially by
	    automated tools and found to be greater than the implied
	    suffix <literal>,0</literal> on the earlier package.</para>

	  <para>Dropping or resetting <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar>
	    incorrectly leads
	    to no end of grief; if you do not understand the above discussion,
	    please keep after it until you do, or ask questions on
	    the mailing lists.</para>

	  <para>It is expected that <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> will
	    not be used for the majority of ports, and that sensible
	    use of <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> can often pre-empt
	    it becoming necessary if a future release of the software
	    should change the version structure. However, care is
	    needed by FreeBSD porters when a vendor release is made
	    without an official version number &mdash; such as a code
	    <quote>snapshot</quote> release.  The temptation is to label the
	    release with the release date, which will cause problems
	    as in the example above when a new <quote>official</quote> release is
	    made.</para>

	  <para>For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date
	    20000917, and the previous version of the software was
	    version 1.2, the snapshot release should be given a
	    <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> of 1.2.20000917 or similar,
	    not 20000917, so that the succeeding release, say 1.3, is
	    still a numerically greater value.</para>

	    period between them.</para>

	  <para>The idea is to make it easier to sort ports by looking
	    at the version string.  In particular, make sure version
	    number components are always delimited by a period, and
	    if the date is part of the string, use the
	    <literal><replaceable>yyyy</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>dd</replaceable></literal>
	    format, not
	    <literal><replaceable>dd</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></literal>
	    or the non-Y2K compliant
	    <literal><replaceable>yy</replaceable>.<replaceable>mm</replaceable>.<replaceable>dd</replaceable></literal>
	    format.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

	<title>Choosing the right category</title>

	<para>As many of the categories overlap, you often have to choose
	  which of the categories should be the primary category of your port.
	  There are several rules that govern this issue.  Here is the list of
	  priorities, in decreasing order of precedence:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first category must be a physical category (see
	      <link linkend="porting-categories">above</link>).  This is
	      necessary to make the packaging work.  Virtual categories and
	      physical categories may be intermixed after that.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Language specific categories always come first.  For
	      example, if your port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then your
	      <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line would read <filename>japanese
		x11-fonts</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Specific categories are listed before less-specific ones.  For
	      instance, an HTML editor should be listed as <filename>www
		editors</filename>, not the other way around.  Also, you should not
	      list <filename>net</filename> when the port belongs to
	      any of <filename>irc</filename>, <filename>mail</filename>,
	      <filename>mbone</filename>, <filename>news</filename>,
	      <filename>security</filename>, or <filename>www</filename>, as
	      <filename>net</filename> is included implicitly.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>x11</filename> is used as a secondary category only
	      when the primary category is a natural language.  In particular,
	      you should not put <filename>x11</filename> in the category line
	      for X applications.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><application>Emacs</application> modes should be
	      placed in the same ports category as the application
	      supported by the mode, not in
	      <filename>editors</filename>.  For example, an
	      <application>Emacs</application> mode to edit source
	      files of some programming language should go into
	      <filename>lang</filename>.
	      </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>misc</filename>
		  should not appear with any other non-virtual category.
		  If you have <literal>misc</literal> with something else in
		  your <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line, that means you can
		  safely delete <literal>misc</literal> and just put the port
		  in that other subdirectory!</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If your port truly does not belong anywhere else, put it in
	      <filename>misc</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If you are not sure about the category, please put a comment to
	  that effect in your &man.send-pr.1; submission so we can
	  discuss it before we import it.  If you are a committer, send a note
	  to the &a.ports; so we can discuss it first.  Too often, new ports are
	  imported to the wrong category only to be moved right away.
	  This causes unnecessary and undesirable bloat in the master
	  source repository.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="proposing-categories">
	<title>Proposing a new category</title>

	<para>As the Ports Collection has grown over time, various new
	  categories have been introduced.  New categories can either
	  be <emphasis>virtual</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that do
	  not have a corresponding subdirectory in the ports tree&mdash;
	  or <emphasis>physical</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that
	  do.  The following text discusses the issues involved in creating
	  a new physical category so that you can understand them before
	  you propose one.</para>

	<para>Our existing practice has been to avoid creating a new
	  physical category unless either a large number of ports would
	  logically belong to it, or the ports that would belong to it
	  are a logically distinct group that is of limited general
	  interest (for instance, categories related to spoken human
	  languages), or preferably both.</para>

	<para>The rationale for this is that such a change creates a
	  <ulink url="&url.articles.committers-guide;/#ports">
	  fair amount of work</ulink> for both the committers and also
	  for all users who track changes to the Ports Collection.  In
	  addition, proposed category changes just naturally seem to
	  attract controversy.  (Perhaps this is because there is no
	  clear consensus on when a category is <quote>too big</quote>,
	  nor whether categories should lend themselves to browsing (and
	  thus what number of categories would be an ideal number), and
	  so forth.)</para>

	<para>Here is the procedure:</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>Propose the new category on &a.ports;.  You should
	      include a detailed rationale for the new category,
	      including why you feel the existing categories are not
	      sufficient, and the list of existing ports proposed to move.
	      (If there are new ports pending in
	      <application>GNATS</application> that would fit this
	      category, list them too.)  If you are the maintainer and/or
	      submitter, respectively, mention that as it may help you
	      to make your case.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Participate in the discussion.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If it seems that there is support for your idea,
	      file a PR which includes both the rationale and the list
	      of existing ports that need to be moved.  Ideally, this
	      PR should also include patches for the following:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for the
		  new ports once they are repocopied</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  new category</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  old ports' categories</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for ports
		  that depend on the old ports</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>(for extra credit, you can include the other
		  files that have to change, as per the procedure
		  in the Committer's Guide.)</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Since it affects the ports infrastructure and involves
	      not only performing repo-copies but also possibly running
	      regression tests on the build cluster, the PR should be
	      assigned to the &a.portmgr;.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If that PR is approved, a committer will need to follow
	      the rest of the procedure that is
	      <ulink url="&url.articles.committers-guide;/#ports">
	      outlined in the Committer's Guide</ulink>.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>Proposing a new virtual category should be similar to
	  the above but much less involved, since no ports will
	  actually have to move.  In this case, the only patches to
	  include in the PR would be those to add the new category to the
	  <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar>s of the affected ports.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="proposing-reorg">
	<title>Proposing reorganizing all the categories</title>

	<para>Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the categories
	  with either a 2-level structure, or some other kind of keyword
	  structure.  To date, nothing has come of any of these proposals
	  because, while they are very easy to make, the effort involved to
	  retrofit the entire existing ports collection with any kind of
	  reorganization is daunting to say the very least.  Please read
	  the history of these proposals in the mailing list archives before
	  you post this idea; furthermore, you should be prepared to be
	  challenged to offer a working prototype.</para>

      <title>The distribution files</title>

      <para>The second part of the <filename>Makefile</filename> describes the

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTVERSION/DISTNAME</makevar></title>

	<para><makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is the name of the port as

	  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> defaults to
	  <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>, so override it only if necessary.
	  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is only used in two places.
	  First, the distribution file list
	  (<makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>) defaults to
	  <makevar>${DISTNAME}</makevar><makevar>${EXTRACT_SUFX}</makevar>.
	  Second, the distribution file is expected to extract into a

        <para>Some vendor's distribution names which do not fit into the

	<para>Record the directory part of the FTP/HTTP-URL pointing at the

	  the trailing slash (<filename>/</filename>)!</para>

	<para>The <command>make</command> macros will try to use this
	  specification for grabbing the distribution file with
	  <makevar>FETCH</makevar> if they cannot find it already on the
	  system.</para>

	<para>It is recommended that you put multiple sites on this list,
	  preferably from different continents.  This will safeguard against
	  wide-area network problems.  We are even planning to add support
	  for automatically determining the closest master site and fetching
	  from there; having multiple sites will go a long way towards
	  helping this effort.</para>

	<para>If the original tarball is part of one of the popular
	  archives such as X-contrib, GNU, or Perl CPAN, you may be able
	  refer to those sites in an easy compact form using
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar>

	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> to one of these variables and

MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR=   applications</programlisting>

	<para>These variables are defined in

	<para>The user can also set the <makevar>MASTER_SITE_*</makevar>
	  variables in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> to override our

	  instead.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar></title>

	<para>If you have one distribution file, and it uses an odd suffix to
	  indicate the compression mechanism, set
	  <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>.</para>

	<para>For example, if the distribution file was named
	  <filename>foo.tgz</filename> instead of the more normal
	  <filename>foo.tar.gz</filename>, you would write:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTNAME=      foo
EXTRACT_SUFX=  .tgz</programlisting>

	<para>The <makevar>USE_BZIP2</makevar> and <makevar>USE_ZIP</makevar>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>Sometimes the names of the files to be downloaded have no

	  called <filename>source.tar.gz</filename> or similar.  In other
	  cases the application's source code might be in several different
	  archives, all of which must be downloaded.</para>

	<para>If this is the case, set <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> to be a

	  downloaded.</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=     source1.tar.gz source2.tar.gz</programlisting>

	<para>If your port requires some additional patches that are available
	  by FTP or HTTP, set <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> to the names of
	  the files and <makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar> to the URL of the
	  directory that contains them (the format is the same as
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>).</para>

	<para>If the patch is not relative to the top of the source tree
	  (i.e., <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) because it contains some extra
	  pathnames, set <makevar>PATCH_DIST_STRIP</makevar> accordingly. For
	  instance, if all the pathnames in the patch have an extra
	  <literal>foozolix-1.0/</literal> in front of the filenames, then set
	  <literal>PATCH_DIST_STRIP=-p1</literal>.</para>

	<para>Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be
	  decompressed automatically if the filenames end with
	  <filename>.gz</filename> or <filename>.Z</filename>.</para>

	<para>If the patch is distributed with some other files, such as
	  documentation, in a gzip'd tarball, you cannot just use
	  <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar>.  If that is the case, add the name
	  and the location of the patch tarball to
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.
	  Then, use the <makevar>EXTRA_PATCHES</makevar> variable to
	  point to those files and <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>
	  will automatically apply them for you.  In particular, do
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy patch files into the
	  <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> directory&mdash;that directory may
	  not be writable.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The tarball will have been extracted alongside the
	    regular source by then, so there is no need to explicitly extract
	    it if it is a regular gzip'd or compress'd tarball. If you do the
	    latter, take extra care not to overwrite something that already
	    exists in that directory.  Also, do not forget to add a command to

	<para>This section has information on the fetching mechanism

	<para>A little background first.  OpenBSD has a neat feature
	  inside both <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> variables, both files and
	  patches can be postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
	  identifiers where <literal>n</literal> both can be
	  <literal>[0-9]</literal> and denote a group designation.
	  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=      alpha:0 beta:1</programlisting>

	<para>In OpenBSD, distribution file <filename>alpha</filename>
	  will be associated with variable
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES0</makevar> instead of our common
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> and
	  <filename>beta</filename> with
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES1</makevar>.</para>

	<para>This is a very interesting feature which can decrease
	  that endless search for the correct download site.</para>

	<para>Just picture 2 files in <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  20 sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, the sites slow
	  as hell where <filename>beta</filename> is carried by all
	  sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, and
	  <filename>alpha</filename> can only be found in the 20th
	  site.  It would be such a waste to check all of them if

	<para>Now that you have the idea, just imagine more

	    grained fetching of multiple distribution files and
	    patches from different sites and subdirectories.  We
	    describe here a case of simplified
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> usage.  This will be
	    sufficient for most scenarios.  However, if you need
	    further information, you will have to refer to the next
	    section.</para>

	  <para>Some applications consist of multiple distribution
	    files that must be downloaded from a number of different
	    sites.  For example,
	    <application>Ghostscript</application> consists of the
	    core of the program, and then a large number of driver
	    files that are used depending on the user's printer.  Some
	    of these driver files are supplied with the core, but many
	    others must be downloaded from a variety of different
	    sites.</para>

	  <para>To support this, each entry in
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> may be followed by a colon
	    and a <quote>tag name</quote>.  Each site listed in
	    <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> is then followed by a
	    colon, and the tag that indicates which distribution files
	    should be downloaded from this site.</para>

	  <para>For example, consider an application with the source
	    split in two parts, <filename>source1.tar.gz</filename>
	    and <filename>source2.tar.gz</filename>, which must be
	    downloaded from two different sites.  The port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would include lines like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	      with 1 file per site</title>

	    <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=   ftp://ftp.example1.com/:source1 \
		ftp://ftp.example2.com/:source2
DISTFILES=      source1.tar.gz:source1 \
		source2.tar.gz:source2</programlisting>
	  </example>

	  <para>Multiple distribution files can have the same tag.
	    Continuing the previous example, suppose that there was a
	    third distfile, <filename>source3.tar.gz</filename>, that
	    should be downloaded from
	    <hostid>ftp.example2.com</hostid>.	The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would then be written like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>

	  <title>Detailed information</title>

	  <para>Okay, so the previous section example did not reflect
	    your needs?	 In this section we will explain in detail how
	    the fine grained fetching mechanism
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> works and how you can
	    modify your ports to use it.</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements can be postfixed with
		<literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> where
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> is
		<literal>[^:,]+</literal>, i.e.,
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> could conceptually be any
		alphanumeric string but we will limit it to
		<literal>[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]+</literal> for
		now.</para>

	      <para>Moreover, string matching is case sensitive;
		i.e., <literal>n</literal> is different from
		<literal>N</literal>.</para>

	      <para>However, the following words cannot be used for
		postfixing purposes since they yield special meaning:
		<literal>default</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and
		<literal>ALL</literal> (they are used internally in
		item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-what-changes-in-port-targets">).
		Furthermore, <literal>DEFAULT</literal> is a special
		purpose word (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
		belong to the group <literal>n</literal>,
		<literal>:m</literal> belong to group
		<literal>m</literal> and so forth.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">
	      <para>Elements without a postfix are groupless, i.e.,
		they all belong to the special group
		<literal>DEFAULT</literal>.  If you postfix any
		elements with <literal>DEFAULT</literal>, you are just
		being redundant unless you want to have an element
		belonging to both <literal>DEFAULT</literal> and other
		groups at the same time (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">).</para>

	      <para>The following examples are equivalent but the
		first one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=   alpha

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Groups are not exclusive, an element may belong to
		several different groups at the same time and a group
		can either have either several different elements or
		none at all.  Repeated elements within the same group
		will be simply that, repeated elements.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">
	      <para>When you want an element to belong to several
		groups at the same time, you can use the comma
		operator (<literal>,</literal>).</para>

	      <para>Instead of repeating it several times, each time
		with a different postfix, we can list several groups
		at once in a single postfix.  For instance,
		<literal>:m,n,o</literal> marks an element that
		belongs to group <literal>m</literal>,
		<literal>n</literal> and <literal>o</literal>.</para>

	      <para>All the following examples are equivalent but the
		last one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=   alpha alpha:SOME_SITE

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT alpha:SOME_SITE

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:SOME_SITE,DEFAULT

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT,SOME_SITE</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>All sites within a given group are sorted
		according to <makevar>MASTER_SORT_AWK</makevar>.  All
		groups within <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> and
		<makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar> are sorted as
		well.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-group-semantics">
	      <para>Group semantics can be used in any of the
		following variables <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>,
		<makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar>,
		<makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar>,
		<makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar>,
		<makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>, and
		<makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> according to the
		following syntax:</para>

	      <orderedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>All <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>,
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar>,
		    <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> and
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> elements must
		    be terminated with the forward slash
		    <literal>/</literal> character.  If any elements
		    belong to any groups, the group postfix
		    <literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>
		    must come right after the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal>.  The
		    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> mechanism relies
		    on the existence of the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal> to avoid confusing elements
		    where a <literal>:n</literal> is a valid part of
		    the element with occurrences where
		    <literal>:n</literal> denotes group
		    <literal>n</literal>.  For compatibility purposes,
		    since the <literal>/</literal> terminator was not
		    required before in both
		    <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> and
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> elements, if
		    the postfix immediate preceding character is not
		    a <literal>/</literal> then <literal>:n</literal>
		    will be considered a valid part of the element
		    instead of a group postfix even if an element is
		    postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>.  See both

	<para>If your port uses binary distfiles and has a license that

	  will instruct the &os; build cluster to keep a copy of the files
	  specified in <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>.  Users of these ports

	  <title>Notes on dependencies</title>

	  <para>As mentioned above, the default target to call when a
	    dependency is required is <maketarget>DEPENDS_TARGET</maketarget>.
	    It defaults to <literal>install</literal>.  This is a user
	    variable; it is never defined in a port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename>.  If your port needs a special way
	    to handle a dependency, use the <literal>:target</literal> part of
	    the <makevar>*_DEPENDS</makevar> variables instead of redefining
	    <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar>.</para>

	  <para>When you type <command>make clean</command>, its dependencies
	    are automatically cleaned too.  If you do not wish this to happen,
	    define the variable <makevar>NOCLEANDEPENDS</makevar> in your
	    environment.  This may be particularly desirable if the port
	    has something that takes a long time to rebuild in its
	    dependency list, such as KDE, GNOME or Mozilla.</para>

	  <para>To depend on another port unconditionally, use the
	    variable <makevar>${NONEXISTENT}</makevar> as the first field
	    of <makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar> or
	    <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar>.  Use this only when you need to
	    get the source of the other port.  You can often save
	    compilation time by specifying the target too.  For
	    instance

	    <programlisting>BUILD_DEPENDS=   ${NONEXISTENT}:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg:extract</programlisting>

	    will always descend to the <literal>jpeg</literal> port and extract it.</para>

	  <para>Do not use <makevar>DEPENDS</makevar> unless there is no other
	    way the behavior you want can be accomplished.  It will cause the
	    other port to always be built (and installed, by default), and the
	    dependency will go into the packages as well.  If this is really
	    what you need, you should probably write it as
	    <literal>BUILD_DEPENDS</literal> and
	    <literal>RUN_DEPENDS</literal> instead&mdash;at least the

	<para>The ports building technology does not tolerate

	  These can really be hard to detect; if in doubt, before
	  you make that change, make sure you have done the following:
	  <command>cd /usr/ports; make index</command>.  That process
	  can be quite slow on older machines, but you may be able to
	  save a large number of people&mdash;including yourself&mdash;
	  a lot of grief in the process.</para>

      <title><makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar></title>

      <para>If your port needs to build slightly different versions of
	packages by having a variable (for instance, resolution, or paper
	size) take different values, create one subdirectory per package to
	make it easier for users to see what to do, but try to share as many
	files as possible between ports.  Typically you only need a very short
	<filename>Makefile</filename> in all but one of the directories if you
	use variables cleverly.  In the sole <filename>Makefile</filename>,
	you can use <makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar> to specify the directory
	where the rest of the files are.  Also, use a variable as part of
	<link linkend="porting-pkgname"><makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar></link> so
	the packages will have different names.</para>

	be destroyed and recreated by <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>
	to make sure it points to the correct file.  Any manpages
	listed in MLINKS must not be listed in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>To specify whether the manpages are compressed upon installation,
	use the <makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar> variable. This variable can
	take three values, <literal>yes</literal>, <literal>no</literal> and
	<literal>maybe</literal>. <literal>yes</literal> means manpages are
	already installed compressed, <literal>no</literal> means they are
	not, and <literal>maybe</literal> means the software already respects
	the value of <makevar>NOMANCOMPRESS</makevar> so
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> does not have to do anything
	special.</para>

      <para><makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar> is automatically set to
	<literal>yes</literal> if <makevar>USE_IMAKE</makevar> is set and
	<makevar>NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES</makevar> is not set, and to
	<literal>no</literal> otherwise.  You do not have to explicitly define
	it unless the default is not suitable for your port.</para>

      <para>If your port anchors its man tree somewhere other than
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, you can use the
	<makevar>MANPREFIX</makevar> to set it.  Also, if only manpages in
	certain sections go in a non-standard place, such as some <literal>perl</literal> modules
	ports, you can set individual man paths using
	<makevar>MAN<replaceable>sect</replaceable>PREFIX</makevar> (where
	<replaceable>sect</replaceable> is one of <literal>1-9</literal>,
	<literal>L</literal> or <literal>N</literal>).</para>

      <para>If your manpages go to language-specific subdirectories, set the
	name of the languages to <makevar>MANLANG</makevar>.  The value of
	this variable defaults to <literal>""</literal> (i.e., English
	only).</para>

      <para>Here is an example that puts it all together.</para>

      <para>Additionally <filename>${PREFIX}/man/man8/alt-name.8.gz</filename>
	may or may not be installed by your port.  Regardless, a

	<sect3>
	  <title>Background</title>
	    <para>The <makevar>OPTIONS</makevar> variable gives the user who
	      installs the port a dialog with the available options and saves
	      them to <filename>/var/db/ports/<replaceable>portname</replaceable>/options</filename>.
	      Next time when the port has to be rebuild, the options are reused.
	      Never again you will have to remember all the twenty
	      <makevar>WITH_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar> and
	      <makevar>WITHOUT_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar> options you
	      used to build this port!</para>

	    <para>When the user runs <command>make config</command> (or runs
	      <command>make build</command> for the first time), the framework will
	      check for
	      <filename>/var/db/ports/<replaceable>portname</replaceable>/options</filename>.
	      If that file does not exist, it will use the values of
	      <makevar>OPTIONS</makevar> to create a dialogbox where the options
	      can be enabled or disabled.  Then the
	      <filename>options</filename> file is saved and the selected
	      variables will be used when building the port.</para>

	    <para>Use <command>make showconfig</command> to see the saved
	      configuration.  Use <command>make rmconfig</command> to remove the
	      saved configuration.</para>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Syntax</title>
	    <para>The syntax for the <makevar>OPTIONS</makevar> variable is:

<programlisting>OPTIONS=	OPTION	"descriptive text" default ...
</programlisting>

	      The value for default is either <literal>ON</literal> or
	      <literal>OFF</literal>.  Multiple repetitions of these three fields
	      are allowed.</para>

	    <para><makevar>OPTIONS</makevar> definition must appear before
	      the inclusion of <filename>bsd.port.pre.mk</filename>.
	      The <makevar>WITH_*</makevar> and <makevar>WITHOUT_*</makevar>
	      variables can only be tested after the inclusion of
	      <filename>bsd.port.pre.mk</filename>.</para>

	    <para>
	      Due to a deficiency in the infrastructure, you can only test
	      <makevar>WITH_*</makevar> variables for options which are
	      <literal>OFF</literal> by default, and
	      <makevar>WITHOUT_*</makevar> variables for options which
	      default to <literal>ON</literal>.  The reasoning behind this:
	      when packages are built with <makevar>PACKAGE_BUILDING</makevar> or
	      <makevar>BATCH</makevar> defined, the <command>config</command>
	      target is not run, and therefore no <makevar>OPTIONS</makevar>
	      are selected.  This would cause <command>make depends</command> and
	      <command>make describe</command> to break for ports not following
	      the aforementioned rule.</para>

      <para>There are some more things you have to take into account when you
	create a port.  This section explains the most common of those.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-shlibs">
	<title>Shared Libraries</title>

	<para>If your port installs one or more shared libraries, define a
	  <makevar>USE_LDCONFIG</makevar> make variable, which will instruct
	  a <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to run
	  <literal>&dollar;{LDCONFIG} -m</literal> on the directory where the
	  new library is installed (usually
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib</filename>) during
	  <maketarget>post-install</maketarget> target to register it into the
	  shared library cache.  This variable, when defined, will also
	  facilitate addition of an appropriate
	  <literal>@exec /sbin/ldconfig -m</literal> and
	  <literal>@unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R</literal> pair into your
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file, so that a user who installed
	  the package can start using the shared library immediately and
	  de-installation will not cause the system to still believe the
	  library is there.</para>

	<programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG= yes</programlisting>

	<para>If you need, you can override the default directory
	  by setting the <makevar>USE_LDCONFIG</makevar>
	  value to a list of directories into which
	  shared libraries are to be installed.  For example if your port
	  installs shared libraries into
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/foo</filename> and
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/bar</filename> directories
	  you could use the following in your
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG= ${PREFIX}/lib/foo ${PREFIX}/lib/bar</programlisting>

	<para>Please
	  double-check, often this is not necessary at all or can be avoided
	  through <literal>-rpath</literal> or setting <envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar>
	  during linking (see <filename role="package">lang/moscow_ml</filename>
	  for an example), or through a shell-wrapper which sets
	  <makevar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</makevar> before invoking the binary, like
	  <filename role="package">www/mozilla</filename> does.</para>

	<para>When installing 32-bit libraries on 64-bit system, use
	  <makevar>USE_LDCONFIG32</makevar> instead.</para>

	<para>Try to keep shared library version numbers in the
	  <filename>libfoo.so.0</filename> format.  Our runtime linker only
	  cares for the major (first) number.</para>

	<para>When the major library version number increments in the update
	  to the new port version, all other ports that link to the affected
	  library should have their <makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> incremented,
	  to force recompilation with the new library version.</para>

	<para>If the port installs shared libraries with long version numbers,
	  e.g. <filename>libfoo.so.0.2.9</filename>, the ports infrastructure
	  will try to rename the files.  Define
	  <makevar>NO_FILTER_SHLIBS</makevar> to disable this
	  functionality.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable indicates that we may not generate a binary

	  disallow binary redistribution, or it may prohibit distribution
	  of packages created from patched sources.</para>

	<para>However, the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> may be
	  freely mirrored on FTP/HTTP.  They may also be distributed on
	  a CD-ROM (or similar media) unless <makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar>

	<para><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should also be used if the binary
	  package is not generally useful, and the application should always

	  has configuration information that is site specific hard coded in to
	  it at compile time, set <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should be set to a string

	  generated.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar></title>

	<para>This variable alone indicates that, although we are allowed
	  to generate binary packages, we may put neither those packages
	  nor the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> onto a CD-ROM (or
	  similar media) for resale.  However, the binary packages and
	  the port's <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> will still be available
	  via FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para> If this variable is set along with
	  <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>, then only the port's

	  FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed

	<para>Tools which check for the availability of these files

	<para>Set this variable alone if the application's license permits

	<para><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> or <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>
	  should not be set along with <makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar>
	  since the latter variable implies the former ones.</para>

	<para><makevar>RESTRICTED</makevar> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed.
	  Typically, this indicates that the port contains proprietary
	  software and that the user will need to manually download the

	  <title>Introduction</title>

	  <para>The various GNU autotools provide an abstraction mechanism for
	    building a piece of software over a wide variety of operating
	    systems and machine architectures.  Within the Ports Collection,
	    an individual port can make use of these tools via a simple
	    construct:</para>

	  <programlisting>USE_AUTOTOOLS= <replaceable>tool</replaceable>:<replaceable>version</replaceable>[:<replaceable>operation</replaceable>] ...</programlisting>

	  <para>At the time of writing, <replaceable>tool</replaceable> can be
	    one of <literal>libtool</literal>, <literal>libltdl</literal>,
	    <literal>autoconf</literal>, <literal>autoheader</literal>,
	    <literal>automake</literal> or <literal>aclocal</literal>.</para>

	  <para><replaceable>version</replaceable> specifies the particular
	    tool revision to be used (see
	    <literal>devel/{automake,autoconf,libtool}[0-9]+</literal> for
	    valid versions).</para>

	  <para><replaceable>operation</replaceable> is an optional extension
	    to modify how the tool is used.</para>

	  <para>Multiple tools can be specified at once, either by including
	    them all on a single line, or using the <literal>+=</literal>
	    Makefile construct.</para>

	  <para>Before proceeding any further, it cannot be stressed highly
	    enough that the constructs discussed here are for use ONLY in
	    building other ports.  For cross-development work, the
	    <literal>devel/gnu-{automake,autoconf,libtool}</literal> ports
	    should be used, such as within an IDE.  <filename
	    role="package">devel/anjuta</filename> and <filename

	    respectively) are good examples of how to achieve this.</para>

	  <para>Shared libraries using the GNU building framework usually use

	    underlying operating system.  The usual practice is to use copy of
	    <command>libtool</command> bundled with the application.  In case

	    The <makevar>GNU_CONFIGURE</makevar> is implied.
	    Further, a number of make and shell
	    variables will be assigned for onward use by the port.  See

      <title>Using GNU <literal>gettext</literal></title>

      <sect2>
	<title>Basic usage</title>

	<para>If your port requires <literal>gettext</literal>,
	  just set <makevar>USE_GETTEXT</makevar> to <literal>yes</literal>,
	  and your port will grow the dependency on <filename
	  role="package">devel/gettext</filename>.  The value of
	  <makevar>USE_GETTEXT</makevar> can also specify the required
	  version of the <literal>libintl</literal> library, the basic
	  part of <literal>gettext</literal>, but using this
	  feature is <emphasis>strongly discouraged</emphasis>:
	  Your port should work with just the current version of
	  <filename role="package">devel/gettext</filename>.</para>

	<para>A rather common case is a port using
	  <literal>gettext</literal> and <command>configure</command>.
	  Generally, GNU <command>configure</command> should be
	  able to locate <literal>gettext</literal> automatically.
	  If it ever fails to, hints at the location of
	  <literal>gettext</literal> can be passed in
	  <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> and <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_GETTEXT=    yes
CPPFLAGS+=      -I${LOCALBASE}/include
LDFLAGS+=       -L${LOCALBASE}/lib

GNU_CONFIGURE=  yes
CONFIGURE_ENV=  CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS}" \
                LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS}"</programlisting>

	<para>Of course, the code can be more compact if there are no
	  more flags to pass to <command>configure</command>:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_GETTEXT=    yes
GNU_CONFIGURE=  yes
CONFIGURE_ENV=  CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
                LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Optional usage</title>

	<para>Some software products allow for disabling NLS,
	  e.g., through passing <option>--disable-nls</option> to
	  <command>configure</command>.  In that case, your port
	  should use <literal>gettext</literal> conditionally,
	  depending on the status of <link
	  linkend="knobs-without-nls"><makevar>WITHOUT_NLS</makevar></link>.
	  For ports of low to medium complexity, you can rely on the
	  following idiom:</para>

	<programlisting>GNU_CONFIGURE=          yes

.if !defined(WITHOUT_NLS)
USE_GETTEXT=            yes
PLIST_SUB+=             NLS=""
.else
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --disable-nls
PLIST_SUB+=             NLS="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

	<para>The next item on your to-do list is to arrange so that
	  the message catalog files are included in the packing list
	  conditionally.  The <filename>Makefile</filename> part of
	  this task is already provided by the idiom.  It is explained
	  in the section on <link linkend="plist-sub">advanced
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> practices</link>.  In a
	  nutshell, each occurrence of <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> will be replaced by
	  <quote><literal>@comment&nbsp;</literal></quote> if NLS is
	  disabled, or by a null string if NLS is enabled.  Consequently,
	  the lines prefixed by <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> will become
	  mere comments in the final packing list if NLS is off;
	  otherwise the prefix will be just left out.  All you need
	  to do now is insert <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> before each
	  path to a message catalog file in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.
	  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>%%NLS%%share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo
%%NLS%%share/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo</programlisting>

	<para>In high complexity cases, you may need to use more advanced
	  techniques than the recipe given here, such as <link
	  linkend="plist-dynamic">dynamic packing list generation</link>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Handling message catalog directories</title>

	<para>There is a point to note about installing message catalog
	  files.  The target directories for them, which reside under
	  <filename><makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar>/share/locale</filename>,
	  should rarely be created and removed by your port.  The
	  most popular languages have their respective directories
	  listed in <filename>/etc/mtree/BSD.local.dist</filename>;
	  that is, they are a part of the base system.  The directories
	  for many other languages are governed by the <filename
	  role="package">devel/gettext</filename> port.  You may want
	  to consult its <filename>pkg-plist</filename> and see whether
	  your port is going to install a message catalog file for a
	  unique language.</para>

      <sect2 id="java-building-with-ant">
	<title>Building with Ant</title>

	<para>When the port is to be built using Apache Ant, it has to
	  define <makevar>USE_ANT</makevar>. Ant is thus considered to be
	  the sub-make command. When no <literal>do-build</literal> target
	  is defined by the port, a default one will be set that simply
	  runs Ant according to <makevar>MAKE_ENV</makevar>,
	  <makevar>MAKE_ARGS</makevar> and <makevar>ALL_TARGETS</makevar>.
	  This is similar to the <makevar>USE_GMAKE</makevar> mechanism,
	  which is documented in <xref linkend="building">.</para>

	<para>If <command>jikes</command> is used in place of
	  <command>javac</command> (see <makevar>USE_JIKES</makevar> in
	  <xref linkend="java-variables">), then Ant will automatically
	  use it to build the port.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="java-best-practices">
	<title>Best practices</title>

	<para>When porting a Java library, your port should install the
	  JAR file(s) in <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>, and everything
	  else under <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename>
	  (except for the documentation, see below). In order to reduce
	  the packing file size, you may reference the JAR file(s) directly
	  in the <filename>Makefile</filename>. Just use the following
	  statement (where <filename>myport.jar</filename> is the name
	  of the JAR file installed as part of the port):</para>

	<programlisting>PLIST_FILES+= %%JAVAJARDIR%%/myport.jar</programlisting>

	<para>When porting a Java application, the port usually installs
	  everything under a single directory (including its JAR
	  dependencies).  The use of
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> is strongly
	  encouraged in this regard.  It is up the porter to decide
	  whether the port should install the additional JAR dependencies
	  under this directory or directly use the already installed ones
	  (from <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>).</para>

	<para>Regardless of the type of your port (library or application),
	  the additional documentation should be installed in the
	  <link linkend="dads-documentation">same location</link> as for
	  any other port.  The JavaDoc tool is known to produce a
	  different set of files depending on the version of the JDK that
	  is used. For ports that do not enforce the use of a particular
	  JDK, it is therefore a complex task to specify the packing list
	  (<filename>pkg-plist</filename>).  This is one reason why
	  porters are strongly encouraged to use the
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> macro.  Moreover, even if you can
	  predict the set of files that will be generated by
	  <command>javadoc</command>, the size of the resulting
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> advocates for the use of
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>.</para>

	<para>The default value for <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> is
	  <filename>${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}</filename>.  It is a good
	  idea to override <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> to
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> for Java ports.
	  Indeed, <makevar>DATADIR</makevar> is automatically added to
	  <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar> (documented in <xref
	  linkend="plist-sub">) so you may use
	  <literal>%%DATADIR%%</literal> directly in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>As for the choice of building Java ports from source or
	  directly installing them from a binary distribution, there is
	  no defined policy at the time of writing.  However, people from
	  the <ulink
	  url="http://www.freebsd.org/java/">&os; Java Project</ulink>
	  encourage porters to have their ports built from source whenever
	  it is a trivial task.</para>

	<para>All the features that have been presented in this section
	  are implemented in <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>. If you
	  ever think that your port needs more sophisticated Java support,
	  please first have a look at the <ulink
	  url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/Mk/bsd.java.mk">
	  bsd.java.mk CVS log</ulink> as it usually takes some time to
	  document the latest features.  Then, if you think the support
	  you are lacking would be beneficial to many other Java ports,
	  feel free to discuss it on the &a.java;.</para>

	<para>Although there is a <literal>java</literal> category for
	  PRs, it refers to the JDK porting effort from the &os; Java
	  project.  Therefore, you should submit your Java port in the
	  <literal>ports</literal> category as for any other port, unless
	  the issue you are trying to resolve is related to either a JDK
	  implementation or <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.</para>

	<para>Similarly, there is a defined policy regarding the
	  <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> of a Java port, which is detailed
	  in <xref linkend="makefile-categories">.</para>

	<title>Changing <filename>pkg-plist</filename> based on make
	  variables</title>

	<para>Some ports, particularly the <literal>p5-</literal> ports,
	  need to change their <filename>pkg-plist</filename> depending on
	  what options they are configured with (or version of
	  <literal>perl</literal>, in the case of <literal>p5-</literal>
	  ports).  To make this easy, any instances in the
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>,
	  <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>, and
	  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> will be substituted for
	  appropriately.  The value of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal> is the
	  numeric revision of the operating system (e.g.,
	  <literal>4.9</literal>).  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> is
	  the full version number of <command>perl</command> (e.g.,
	  <literal>5.00502</literal>) and <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>
	  is the <command>perl</command> version number minus
	  the patchlevel (e.g., <literal>5.005</literal>).  Several other
	  <literal>%%<replaceable>VARS</replaceable>%%</literal> related to
	  port's documentation files are described in <link
	  linkend="dads-documentation">the relevant section</link>.</para>

	<para>If you need to make other substitutions, you can set the
	  <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar> variable with a list of
	  <literal><replaceable>VAR</replaceable>=<replaceable>VALUE</replaceable></literal>
	  pairs and instances of
	  <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal> will be
	  substituted with <replaceable>VALUE</replaceable> in the
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>For instance, if you have a port that installs many files in a
	  version-specific subdirectory, you can put something like</para>

	<programlisting>OCTAVE_VERSION= 2.0.13
PLIST_SUB=      OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

	<para>in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use
	  <literal>%%OCTAVE_VERSION%%</literal> wherever the version shows up
	  in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That way, when you upgrade the port,
	  you will not have to change dozens (or in some cases, hundreds) of
	  lines in the <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>This substitution (as well as addition of any <link
	  linkend="makefile-manpages">manual pages</link>) will be done between
	  the <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget> and
	  <maketarget>do-install</maketarget> targets, by reading from
	  <filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename> and writing to
	  <filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename>
	  (default:
	  <filename><makevar>WRKDIR</makevar>/.PLIST.mktmp</filename>).  So if
	  your port builds <filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename>
	  on the fly, do so in or
	  before <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget>.  Also, if your port
	  needs to edit the resulting file, do so in
	  <maketarget>post-install</maketarget> to a file named
	  <filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename>.</para>

	<para>Another possibility to modify port's packing list is based
	  on setting the variables <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>.  The value of each variable
	  is regarded as a list of pathnames to
	  write to <filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename>
	  along with <filename><makevar>PLIST</makevar></filename>
	  contents.  Names listed in <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar>
	  and <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> are subject to
	  <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal>
	  substitution, as described above.
	  Except for that, names from <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar>
	  will appear in the final packing list unchanged,
	  while <literal>@dirrm</literal> will be
	  prepended to names from <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar>.
	  To take effect, <makevar>PLIST_FILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PLIST_DIRS</makevar> must be set before
	  <filename><makevar>TMPPLIST</makevar></filename> is written,
	  i.e. in <maketarget>pre-install</maketarget> or earlier.</para>

	  <title>Cleaning up empty directories</title>

	<para>Do make your ports remove empty directories when they are
	  de-installed.  This is usually accomplished by adding
	  <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines for all directories that are
	  specifically created by the port.  You need to delete subdirectories

	  <para>Empty directories created during port installation need special

      <sect1 id="plist-dynamic">
	<title>Dynamic vs. static package list</title>

	<para>A <emphasis>static package list</emphasis> is a package list

	  Even if the contents are auto-generated by a tool or a target
	  in the Makefile <emphasis>before</emphasis> the inclusion into the

	  static list, since it is possible to examine it without having
	  to download or compile the distfile.</para>

	<para>A <emphasis>dynamic package list</emphasis> is a package list
	  which is generated at the time the port is compiled based upon the
	  files and directories which are installed.  It is not possible to
	  examine it before the source code of the ported application
	  is downloaded and compiled, or after running a <literal>make
	  clean</literal>.</para>

	<para>While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden,
	  maintainers should use static package lists wherever possible, as it
	  enables users to &man.grep.1; through available ports to discover,
	  for example, which port installs a certain file.  Dynamic lists
	  should be primarily used for
	  complex ports where the package list changes drastically based upon
	  optional features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package
	  list is infeasible), or ports which change the
	  package list based upon the version of dependent software used (e.g.
	  ports which generate docs with
	  <application>Javadoc</application>).</para>

	<para>Maintainers who prefer dynamic package lists are encouraged to
	  add a new target to their port which generates the
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file so that users may examine
	  the contents.</para>

      </sect1>

    <sect1 id="plist-autoplist">
      <title>Automated package list creation</title>

      <para>First, make sure your port is almost complete, with only

      <para>Next, create a temporary directory tree into which your port can be

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/$(make -V PORTNAME)</userinput>

      <para>If your port honors <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> (which it should)
	you can then install the port and create the package list.</para>

&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /var/tmp/$(make -V PORTNAME) && find -d * \! -type d) | sort &gt; pkg-plist</userinput></screen>

      <para>Finally, you need to tidy up the packing list by hand; it is not
	<emphasis>all</emphasis> automated.  Manual pages should be listed in
	the port's <filename>Makefile</filename> under
	<makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar>, and not in the
	package list.  User configuration files should be removed, or
	installed as
	<filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>.
	The <filename>info/dir</filename> file should not be listed
	and appropriate <filename>install-info</filename> lines should
	be added as noted in the <link linkend="makefile-info">info
	files</link> section.  Any
	libraries installed by the port should be listed as specified in the
	<link linkend="porting-shlibs">shared libraries</link> section.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, use the <command>plist</command> script in
	<filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/</filename> to build the
	package list automatically.  The first step is the same as
	above: take the first three lines, that is,
	<command>mkdir</command>, <command>mtree</command> and
	<command>make depends</command>.  Then build and install the

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install PREFIX=/var/tmp/$(make -V PORTNAME)</userinput></screen>

      <para>And let <command>plist</command> create the

	<note>
	  <para>It is important to be able to generate this file no

      <sect1 id="porting-prefix">
	<title><makevar>PREFIX</makevar> and <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar></title>

	<para><makevar>PREFIX</makevar> determines the location where
	  the port will install.  It is usually <filename>/usr/local</filename>,
	  or <filename>/opt</filename>.  User can set <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>
	  to anything he wants.  Your port must respect this variable.</para>

	<para><makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>, if set by user, determines the
	  complete alternative environment, usually a jail, or an installed
	  system mounted elsewhere than <filename>/</filename>.
	  A port will actually install into
	  <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>/<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, and register
	  with the package database in <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>/var/db/pkg.
	  It is very important to write ports that respect
	  <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>.</para>

	<para>The value of <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> will be set
	  to <makevar>LOCALBASE_REL</makevar> (default
	  <filename>/usr/local</filename>).  If
	  <makevar>USE_X_PREFIX</makevar> or <makevar>USE_IMAKE</makevar> is
	  set, <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> will be <makevar>X11BASE_REL</makevar> (default
	  <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>).  If
	  <makevar>USE_LINUX_PREFIX</makevar> is set, <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>
	  will be <makevar>LINUXBASE_REL</makevar> (default
	  <filename>/compat/linux</filename>).</para>

	<para>Avoiding the hard-coding of <filename>/usr/local</filename> or
	  <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename> anywhere in the source will make the
	  port much more flexible and able to cater to the needs of other
	  sites.  For X ports that use <command>imake</command>, this is
	  automatic; otherwise, this can often be done by simply replacing the
	  occurrences of <filename>/usr/local</filename> (or
	  <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename> for X ports that do not use imake)
	  in the various <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the port to read
	  <makevar>${PREFIX}</makevar>, as this variable is automatically passed
	  down to every stage of the build and install processes.</para>

	<para>Make sure your application is not installing things in
	<filename>/usr/local</filename> instead of <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>.
	A quick test for this is to do this is:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make clean; make package PREFIX=/var/tmp/$(make -V PORTNAME)</userinput></screen>

	<para>If anything is installed outside of <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>,
	the package creation process will complain that it
	cannot find the files.</para>

	<!-- XXX This paragraph is confusing and poorly indented. -->
	<para>This does not test for the existence of internal references,
	or correct use of <makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> for references to
	files from other ports.  Testing the installation in
	<filename>/var/tmp/$(make -V PORTNAME)</filename>
	to do that while you have it installed would do that.</para>

	<para>Do not set <makevar>USE_X_PREFIX</makevar> unless your port
	  truly requires it (i.e., it needs to
	  reference files in <makevar>X11BASE</makevar>).</para>

	<para>The variable <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> can be reassigned in your
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> or in the user's environment.
	  However, it is strongly discouraged for individual ports to set this
	  variable explicitly in the <filename>Makefile</filename>s.</para>

	<para>Also, refer to programs/files from other ports with the
	  variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For instance, if
	  your port requires a macro <literal>PAGER</literal> to be the full
	  pathname of <command>less</command>, use the compiler flag:

	  <programlisting>-DPAGER=\"&dollar;{LOCALBASE}/bin/less\"</programlisting>

	  instead of
	  <literal>-DPAGER=\"/usr/local/bin/less\"</literal>. This way it will
	  have a better chance of working if the system administrator has
	  moved the whole <filename>/usr/local</filename> tree somewhere else.</para>

	<para>Note that <makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar>,
	  <makevar>LINUXBASE</makevar>, <makevar>X11BASE</makevar>,
	  <makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar>, <makevar>EXAMPLESDIR</makevar>,
	  <makevar>DATADIR</makevar>, <makevar>DESKTOPDIR</makevar> variables
	  already contain <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>.  Using
	  <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>&nbsp;<makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> is
	  wrong.  Use <makevar>LOCALBASE_REL</makevar>,
	  <makevar>LINUXBASE_REL</makevar>, <makevar>X11BASE_REL</makevar>
	  if you need a variable relative to <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>.
	  To keep things terse, <makevar>TARGETDIR</makevar> can be used to
	  replace <makevar>DESTDIR</makevar>&nbsp;<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>.</para>

	<para>Example of correct usage:</para>

	${INSTALL_DATA} ${WRKSRC}/guide.txt ${DOCSDIR}</programlisting>

	<para>When referencing dependencies in the port, the

      <title>Upgrading</title>

      <para>When you notice that a port is out of date compared to the latest
	version from the original authors, you should first ensure that you
	have the latest
	port.  You can find them in the
	<filename>ports/ports-current</filename> directory of the &os; FTP mirror
	sites.  However, if you are working with more than a few
	ports, you will probably find it easier to use
	<application>CVSup</application> to keep your whole ports collection
	up-to-date, as described in the
	<ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/synching.html#CVSUP-CONFIG">Handbook</ulink>.
	This will have the added benefit of tracking all the ports'
	dependencies.</para>

      <para>The next step is to see if there is an update already pending.
	To do this, you have two options.  There is a searchable interface
	to the
	<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	FreeBSD Problem Report (PR) database</ulink> (also known as
	<literal>GNATS</literal>).  Select <literal>ports</literal> in the
	dropdown, and enter the name of the port.</para>

      <para>However, sometimes people forget to put the name of the port
	into the Synopsis field in an unambiguous fashion.  In that case,
	you can try the <link linkend="portsmon">
	FreeBSD Ports Monitoring System</link> (also known as
	<literal>portsmon</literal>).  This system attempts to classify
	port PRs by portname.  To search for PRs about a particular port,
	use the <ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">
	Overview of One Port</ulink>.</para>

      <para>If there is no pending PR, the next step is to send an email
	to the port's maintainer, as shown by
	<command>make maintainer</command>.  That person may
	already be working on an upgrade, or have a reason to not upgrade the
	port right now (because of, for example, stability problems of the new
	version); you would not want to duplicate their work.  Note that
	unmaintained ports are listed with a maintainer of
	<literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>, which is just the general
	ports mailing list, so sending mail there
	probably will not help in this case.</para>

      <para>If the maintainer asks you to do the upgrade or there is
	no maintainer, then you have a chance to help out &os; by
	preparing the update yourself!  Please make the changes and save
	the result of the

	of the new and old
	ports directories (e.g., if your modified port directory is
	called <filename>superedit</filename> and the original is in our tree
	as <filename>superedit.bak</filename>, then save the result of
	<command>diff -ruN superedit.bak superedit</command>).  Either
	unified or context diff is fine, but port committers generally
	prefer unified diffs.  Note the use of the <literal>-N</literal>
	option&mdash;this is the accepted way to force diff to properly
	deal with the case of new files being added or old files being
	deleted.  Before sending us the diff, please examine the
	output to make sure all the changes make sense.  To

	<filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/patchtool.py</filename>.
	Before using it, please read
	<filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/README.patchtool</filename>.</para>

      <para>If the port is unmaintained, and you are actively using
	it yourself, please consider volunteering to become its
	maintainer.  &os; has over 2000 ports without maintainers,
	and this is an area where more volunteers are always needed.

	refer to the
	<ulink url="&url.books.developers-handbook;/policies.html#POLICIES-MAINTAINER">

      <para> The best way to
	send us the diff is by including it via &man.send-pr.1; (category
	<literal>ports</literal>).  If you are maintaining the port,
	be sure to put <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> at the beginning
	of your synopsis line and set the <quote>Class</quote> of your PR
	to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  Otherwise, the
	<quote>Class</quote> of your PR should be
	<literal>change-request</literal>.  Please mention any added or
	deleted files in the message, as they have to be explicitly specified
	to &man.cvs.1; when doing a commit.  If the diff is more than about 20KB,
	please compress and uuencode it; otherwise, just include it in the PR
	as is.</para>

      <para>Before you &man.send-pr.1;, you should review the

      <title>Ports security</title>

      <sect1 id="security-intro">
	<title>Why security is so important</title>

	<para>Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software.
	  Arguably, the most dangerous of them are those opening
	  security vulnerabilities.  From the technical viewpoint,
	  such vulnerabilities are to be closed by exterminating
	  the bugs that caused them.  However, the policies for
	  handling mere bugs and security vulnerabilities are
	  very different.</para>

	<para>A typical small bug affects only those users who have
	  enabled some combination of options triggering the bug.
	  The developer will eventually release a patch followed
	  by a new version of the software, free of the bug, but
	  the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading
	  immediately because the bug has never vexed them.  A
	  critical bug that may cause data loss represents a graver
	  issue.  Nevertheless, prudent users know that a lot of
	  possible accidents, besides software bugs, are likely to
	  lead to data loss, and so they make backups of important
	  data; in addition, a critical bug will be discovered
	  really soon.</para>

	<para>A security vulnerability is all different.  First,
	  it may remain unnoticed for years because often it does
	  not cause software malfunction.  Second, a malicious party
	  can use it to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable
	  system, to destroy or alter sensitive data; and in the
	  worst case the user will not even notice the harm caused.
	  Third, exposing a vulnerable system often assists attackers
	  to break into other systems that could not be compromised

	<title>Fixing security vulnerabilities</title>

	<para>While on the subject of ports and packages, a security
	  vulnerability may initially appear in the original
	  distribution or in the port files.  In the former case,
	  the original software developer is likely to release a
	  patch or a new version instantly, and you will
	  only need to update the port promptly with respect to
	  the author's fix.  If the fix is delayed for some reason,
	  you should either <link linkend="dads-noinstall">mark the port as
	  <makevar>FORBIDDEN</makevar></link>
	  or introduce a patch file of your own to the port.  In
	  the case of a vulnerable port, just fix the port as soon as
	  possible.  In either case, <link linkend="port-upgrading">the
	  standard procedure for submitting your change</link> should
	  be followed unless you have rights to commit it directly
	  to the ports tree.</para>

	<important>
	  <para>Being a ports committer is not enough to commit to
	    an arbitrary port.  Remember that ports usually have
	    maintainers, whom you should respect.</para>
	</important>

	<para>Please make sure that the port's revision is bumped
	  as soon as the vulnerability has been closed.
	  That is how the users who upgrade installed packages
	  on a regular basis will see they need to run an update.
	  Besides, a new package will be built and distributed
	  over FTP and WWW mirrors, replacing the vulnerable one.
	  <makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> should be bumped unless
	  <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> has changed in the course
	  of correcting the vulnerability.  That is you should
	  bump <makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> if you have added a
	  patch file to the port, but you should not if you have updated
	  the port to the latest software version and thus already
	  touched <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar>.  Please refer to the
	  <link linkend="makefile-naming-revepoch">corresponding section</link>
	  for more information.</para>

	<title>Keeping the community informed</title>

	<sect2 id="security-notify-vuxml-db">
	  <title>The VuXML database</title>

	  <para>A very important and urgent step to take as early as
	    a security vulnerability is discovered is to notify the
	    community of port users about the jeopardy.  Such
	    notification serves two purposes.  First, should the danger
	    be really severe, it will be wise to apply an instant workaround,
	    e.g., stop the affected network service or even deinstall
	    the port completely, until the vulnerability is closed.
	    Second, a lot of users tend to upgrade installed packages
	    just occasionally.  They will know from the notification
	    that they <emphasis>must</emphasis> update the package
	    without delay as soon as a corrected version is available.</para>

	  <para>Given the huge number of ports in the tree,
	    a security advisory cannot be issued on each incident
	    without creating a flood and losing the attention of
	    the audience by the time it comes to really serious
	    matters.  Therefore security vulnerabilities found in
	    ports are recorded in <ulink
	    url="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
	    database</ulink>.  The Security Officer Team members
	    are monitoring it for issues requiring their
	    intervention.</para>

	  <para>If you have committer rights, you can update the VuXML
	    database by yourself.  So you will both help the Security
	    Officer Team and deliver the crucial information to the
	    community earlier.  However, if you are not a committer,
	    or you believe you have found an exceptionally severe
	    vulnerability, or whatever, please do not hesitate to
	    contact the Security Officer Team directly as described
	    on the <ulink
	    url="http://www.freebsd.org/security/#how">FreeBSD
	    Security Information</ulink> page.</para>

	  <para>All right, you elected the hard way.  As it may be obvious
	    from its title, the VuXML database is essentially an
	    XML document.  Its source file <filename>vuln.xml</filename>
	    is kept right inside the port <filename
	    role="package">security/vuxml</filename>.  Therefore
	    the file's full pathname will be
	    <filename><envar>PORTSDIR</envar>/security/vuxml/vuln.xml</filename>.
	    Each time you discover a security vulnerability in a
	    port, please add an entry for it to that file.
	    Until you are familiar with VuXML, the best thing you can
	    do is to find an existing entry fitting your case, then copy
	    it and use as a template.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2 id="security-notify-vuxml-intro">
	  <title>A short introduction to VuXML</title>

	  <para>The full-blown XML is complex and far beyond the scope of
	    this book.  However, to gain basic insight on the structure
	    of a VuXML entry, you need only the notion of tags.  XML
	    tag names are enclosed in angle brackets.  Each opening
	    &lt;tag&gt; must have a matching closing &lt;/tag&gt;.
	    Tags may be nested.  If nesting, the inner tags must be
	    closed before the outer ones.  There is a hierarchy of
	    tags, i.e.  more complex rules of nesting them.  Sounds
	    very similar to HTML, doesn't it?  The major difference
	    is that XML is e<emphasis>X</emphasis>tensible, i.e. based
	    on defining custom tags.  Due to its intrinsic structure,
	    XML puts otherwise amorphous data into shape.  VuXML is
	    particularly tailored to mark up descriptions of security
	    vulnerabilities.</para>

	  <para>Now let's consider a realistic VuXML entry:</para>

		it for the template UUID unless you are writing the
		entry from scratch).  You can use &man.uuidgen.1; to
		generate a VuXML UUID; alternatively, if you are using
		FreeBSD 4.x, you may install the port <filename
		role="package">devel/p5-Data-UUID</filename> and issue
		the following command:</para>

	      <programlisting>perl -MData::UUID -le 'print lc new Data::UUID-&gt;create_str'</programlisting>

	<para>Do not write anything to files outside

	  place that is guaranteed to be writable during the port build (see
	  <ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/ports-using.html#PORTS-CD">
	  installing ports from a CDROM</ulink> for an

	<para>Make sure your port honors <makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar>.
	  Most ports do not have to worry about this.  In particular, if you
	  are referring to a <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar> of another port, note
	  that the correct location is
	  <filename><makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar><makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar>/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> not <filename><makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar>/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> or <filename><makevar>.CURDIR</makevar>/../../<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> or some such.</para>

	<para>Also, if you are defining <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar> yourself,

	<title>Differentiating operating systems and OS versions</title>

	<para>You may come across code that needs modifications or conditional
	  compilation based upon what version of Unix it is running under.  If
	  you need to make such changes to the code for conditional
	  compilation, make sure you make the changes as general as possible
	  so that we can back-port code to older FreeBSD systems and cross-port
	  to other BSD systems such as 4.4BSD from CSRG, BSD/386, 386BSD,
	  NetBSD, and OpenBSD.</para>

	<para>The preferred way to tell 4.3BSD/Reno (1990) and newer versions
	  of the BSD code apart is by using the <literal>BSD</literal> macro
	  defined in
	  <ulink url="http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/src/sys/sys/param.h">sys/param.h</ulink>.
	  Hopefully that
	  file is already included; if not, add the code:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(__unix__) || defined(unix)) &amp;&amp; !defined(USG)
#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;
#endif</programlisting>

	<para>to the proper place in the <filename>.c</filename> file.  We
	  believe that every system that defines these two symbols has
	  <filename>sys/param.h</filename>.  If you find a system that
	  does not, we would like to know.  Please send mail to the
	  &a.ports;.</para>

	<para>Another way is to use the GNU Autoconf style of doing
	  this:</para>

	<programlisting>#ifdef HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;
#endif</programlisting>

	<para>Do not forget to add <literal>-DHAVE_SYS_PARAM_H</literal> to the
	  <makevar>CFLAGS</makevar> in the <filename>Makefile</filename> for
	  this method.</para>

	<para>Once you have <filename>sys/param.h</filename> included, you may
	  use:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199103))</programlisting>

	<para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.3 Net2 code base
	  or newer (e.g. FreeBSD 1.x, 4.3/Reno, NetBSD 0.9, 386BSD, BSD/386
	  1.1 and below).</para>

	<para>Use:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199306))</programlisting>

	<para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.4 code base or
	  newer (e.g. FreeBSD 2.x, 4.4, NetBSD 1.0, BSD/386 2.0 or
	  above).</para>

	<para>The value of the <literal>BSD</literal> macro is
	  <literal>199506</literal> for the 4.4BSD-Lite2 code base.  This is
	  stated for informational purposes only.  It should not be used to
	  distinguish between versions of FreeBSD based only on 4.4-Lite vs.
	  versions that have merged in changes from 4.4-Lite2.  The
	  <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> macro should be used instead.</para>

	<para>Use sparingly:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined in all versions of
	      FreeBSD.  Use it if the change you are making
	      <emphasis>only</emphasis> affects FreeBSD.  Porting gotchas like
	      the use of <literal>sys_errlist[]</literal> vs
	      <function>strerror()</function> are Berkeley-isms, not FreeBSD
	      changes.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>In FreeBSD 2.x, <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined to
	      be <literal>2</literal>.  In earlier versions, it is
	      <literal>1</literal>.  Later versions always bump it to match
	      their major version number.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you need to tell the difference between a FreeBSD 1.x
	      system and a FreeBSD 2.x or above system, usually the right answer
	      is to use the <literal>BSD</literal> macros described above.  If
	      there actually is a FreeBSD specific change (such as special
	      shared library options when using <command>ld</command>) then it
	      is OK to use <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> and <literal>#if
		__FreeBSD__ &gt; 1</literal> to detect a FreeBSD 2.x and later
	      system.  If you need more granularity in detecting FreeBSD
	      systems since 2.0-RELEASE you can use the following:</para>

	    <programlisting>#if __FreeBSD__ &gt;= 2
#include &lt;osreldate.h&gt;
#    if __FreeBSD_version &gt;= 199504
	 /* 2.0.5+ release specific code here */
#    endif
#endif</programlisting>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>In the hundreds of ports that have been done, there have only
	  been one or two cases where <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> should
	  have been used.  Just because an earlier port screwed up and used it
	  in the wrong place does not mean you should do so too.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as
	    <quote>2.2.5-STABLE</quote> after the 2.2.5-RELEASE.  The pattern
	    used to be year followed by the month, but we decided to change it
	    to a more straightforward major/minor system starting from 2.2.
	    This is because the parallel development on several branches made
	    it infeasible to classify the releases simply by their real
	    release dates.  If you are making a port now, you do not have to
	    worry about old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for your

      <sect1 id="dads-documentation">
	<title>Install additional documentation</title>

	<para>If your software has some documentation other than the standard
	  man and info pages that you think is useful for the user, install it
	  under <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/doc</filename>.
	  This can be done, like the previous item, in the
	  <maketarget>post-install</maketarget> target.</para>

	<para>Create a new directory for your port.  The directory name should
	  reflect what the port is.  This usually means
	  <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar>. However, if you
	  think the user might want different versions of the port to be
	  installed at the same time, you can use the whole
	  <makevar>PKGNAME</makevar>.</para>

	<para>Make the installation dependent on the variable
	  <makevar>NOPORTDOCS</makevar> so that users can disable it in

.if !defined(NOPORTDOCS)
	${MKDIR} ${DOCSDIR}
	${INSTALL_MAN} ${WRKSRC}/docs/xvdocs.ps ${DOCSDIR}

	<para>Here are some handy variables and how they are expanded
	  by default when used
	  in the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><makevar>DATADIR</makevar> gets expanded to
	      <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/<makevar>PORTNAME</makevar></filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar> gets expanded to
	      <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/doc/<makevar>PORTNAME</makevar></filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><makevar>EXAMPLESDIR</makevar> gets expanded to
	      <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/examples/<makevar>PORTNAME</makevar></filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>These variables are exported to <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar>.
	  Their values will appear there as pathnames relative to
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar></filename> if possible.
	  That is, <filename>share/doc/<makevar>PORTNAME</makevar></filename>
	  will be substituted for <literal>%%DOCSDIR%%</literal>
	  in the packing list by default, and so on.
	  (See more on <filename>pkg-plist</filename> substitution
	  <link linkend="plist-sub">here</link>.)</para>

	<para>All documentation files and directories installed should
	  be included in <filename>pkg-plist</filename> with the
	  <literal>%%PORTDOCS%%</literal> prefix, for example:</para>

	<programlisting>%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/AUTHORS
%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT
%%PORTDOCS%%@dirrm %%DOCSDIR%%</programlisting>

	<para>As an alternative to enumerating the documentation files
	  in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, a port can set the variable
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> to a list of file names and shell
	  glob patterns to add to the final packing list.
	  The names will be relative to <makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar>.
	  Therefore, a port that utilizes <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> and
	  uses a non-default location for its documentation should set
	  <makevar>DOCSDIR</makevar> accordingly.
	  If a directory is listed in <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>
	  or matched by a glob pattern from this variable,
	  the entire subtree of contained files and directories will be
	  registered in the final packing list. If <makevar>NOPORTDOCS</makevar>
	  is defined then files and directories listed in 
	  <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar> would not be installed and neither
	  would be added to port packing list.
	  Installing the documentation at <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>
	  as shown above remains up to the port itself.
	  A typical example of utilizing <makevar>PORTDOCS</makevar>
	  looks as follows:</para>

        <programlisting>PORTDOCS=       README.* ChangeLog docs/*</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>You can also use the <filename>pkg-message</filename> file to

	<para>Try to let the port put things in the right subdirectories of

	  the subdirectory with the port's name, which is incorrect.  Also,
	  many ports put everything except binaries, header files and manual
	  pages in a subdirectory of <filename>lib</filename>, which does
	  not work well with the BSD paradigm.  Many of the files should be
	  moved to one of the following: <filename>etc</filename>
	  (setup/configuration files), <filename>libexec</filename>
	  (executables started internally), <filename>sbin</filename>
	  (executables for superusers/managers), <filename>info</filename>
	  (documentation for info browser) or  <filename>share</filename>
	  (architecture independent files).  See &man.hier.7; for details;
	  the rules governing
	  <filename>/usr</filename> pretty much apply to
	  <filename>/usr/local</filename> too.  The exception are ports
	  dealing with USENET <quote>news</quote>.  They may use

	<title>Marking a port for removal with <makevar>DEPRECATED</makevar>
	  or <makevar>EXPIRATION_DATE</makevar></title>

	<para>Do remember that <makevar>BROKEN</makevar> and
	  <makevar>FORBIDDEN</makevar> are to be used as a
	  temporary resort if a port is not working.  Permanently
	  broken ports should be removed from the tree
	  entirely.</para>

	<para>When it makes sense to do so, users can be warned about
	  a pending port removal with <makevar>DEPRECATED</makevar>
	  and <makevar>EXPIRATION_DATE</makevar>.  The former is
	  simply a string stating why the port is scheduled for removal;
	  the latter is a string in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).  Both
	  will be shown to the user.</para>

	<para>It is possible to set <makevar>DEPRECATED</makevar>
	  without an <makevar>EXPIRATION_DATE</makevar> (for
	  instance, recommending a newer version of the port), but
	  the converse does not make any sense.</para>

	<para>There is no set policy on how much notice to give.
	  Current practice seems to be one month for security-related
	  issues and two months for build issues.  This also gives any
	  interested committers a little time to fix the problems.</para>

      <sect1 id="dads-dot-error">
	<title>Avoid use of the <literal>.error</literal> construct</title>

	<para>The correct way for a <filename>Makefile</filename> to
	  signal that the port can not be installed due to some external
	  factor (for instance, the user has specified an illegal
	  combination of build options) is to set a nonblank value to
	  <makevar>IGNORE</makevar>.  This value will be formatted and
	  shown to the user by <command>make install</command>.</para>

	<para>It is a common mistake to use <literal>.error</literal>
	  for this purpose.  The problem with this is that many
	  automated tools that work with the ports tree will fail in
	  this situation.  The most common occurrence of this is seen
	  when trying to build <filename>/usr/ports/INDEX</filename>
	  (see <xref linkend="make-describe">).  However, even more
	  trivial commands such as <command>make -V maintainer</command>
	  also fail in this scenario.  This is not acceptable.</para>

      <sect1 id="dads-sysctl">
	<title>Usage of <filename>sysctl</filename></title>

	<para>The usage of <filename>sysctl</filename> is discouraged
	  except in targets.  This is because the evaluation of any
	  <literal>makevar</literal>s, such as used during
	  <command>make index</command>, then has to run the command,
	  further slowing down that process.</para>

	<para>Usage of &man.sysctl.8; should always be done

	<title>Rerolling distfiles</title>

	<para>Sometimes the authors of software change the content of
	  released distfiles without changing the file's name.  You have
	  to verify that the changes are official and have been performed
	  by the author.  It has happened in the past that the distfile
	  was silently altered on the download servers with the intent
	  to cause harm or compromise end user security.</para>

	<para>Put the old distfile aside, download the new one, unpack
	  them and compare the content with &man.diff.1;.  If you see
	  nothing suspicious, you can update <filename>distinfo</filename>.
	  Be sure to summarize the differences in your PR or commit log,
	  so that other people know that you have taken care to ensure

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Some versions of &man.make.1; were broken

	      This would often lead to failures during
	      <command>make describe</command> (and thus, the overall
	      ports <command>make index</command>).  The workaround is
	      to enclose the conditional comparison in spaces, e.g.:
	      <programlisting>if ( ${OSVERSION} &gt; 500023 )</programlisting>
	      Be aware that test-installing a port on 4.9 or 5.2

    <chapter id="keeping-up">
      <title>Keeping Up</title>

      <para>The &os; Ports Collection is constantly changing.  Here is
	some information on how to keep up.</para>

      <sect1 id="freshports">
	<title>FreshPorts</title>

	<para>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have
	  already been committed is by subscribing to
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts</ulink>.
	  You can select multiple ports to monitor.  Maintainers are
	  strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive
	  notification of not only their own changes, but also any
	  changes that any other &os; committer has made.  (These are
	  often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying
	  ports framework&mdash;although it would be most polite to
	  receive an advance heads-up from those committing such changes,
	  sometimes this is overlooked or just simply impractical.
	  Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor in nature.
	  We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these
	  cases.)</para>

	<para>If you wish to use FreshPorts, all you need is an
	  account.  If your registered email address is
	  <literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, you will see the opt-in link on the
	  right hand side of the webpages.
	  For those of you who already have a FreshPorts account, but are not
	  using your <literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal> email address,
	  just change your email to <literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, subscribe,
	  then change it back again.</para>

	<para>FreshPorts also has
	  a sanity test feature which automatically tests each commit to the
	  FreeBSD ports tree.  If subscribed to this service, you will be
	  notified of any errors which FreshPorts detects during sanity
	  testing of your commits.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="cvsweb">
	<title>The Web Interface to the Source Repository</title>

	<para>It is possible to browse the files in the source repository by
	  using a web interface.  Changes that affect the entire port system
	  are now documented in the
	  <ulink url="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/CHANGES">
	  CHANGES</ulink> file.  Changes that affect individual ports
	  are now documented in the
	  <ulink url="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/UPDATING">
	  UPDATING</ulink> file.  However, the definitive answer to any
	  question is undoubtedly to read the source code of <ulink
	  url="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk">
	  bsd.port.mk</ulink>, and associated files.</para>

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="ports-mailling-list">
	<title>The &os; Ports Mailing List</title>

	<para>If you maintain ports, you should consider following the
	  &a.ports;.  Important changes to the way ports work will be announced
	  there, and then committed to <filename>CHANGES</filename>.</para>

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="build-cluster">
	<title>The &os; Port Building Cluster on
	  <hostid role="hostname">pointyhat.FreeBSD.org</hostid></title>

	  <para>One of the least-publicized strengths of &os; is that
	    an entire cluster of machines is dedicated to continually
	    building the Ports Collection, for each of the major OS
	    releases and for each Tier-1 architecture.  You can find
	    the results of these builds at
	    <ulink url="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/">package building logs
	    and errors</ulink>.</para>

	  <para>Individual ports are built unless they are specifically
	    marked with <makevar>IGNORE</makevar>.  Ports that are
	    marked with <makevar>BROKEN</makevar> will still be attempted,
	    to see if the underlying problem has been resolved.  (This
	    is done by passing <makevar>TRYBROKEN</makevar> to the
	    port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.)</para>

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="distfile-survey">
	<title>The &os; Port Distfile Survey</title>

	  <para>The build cluster is dedicated to building the latest
	    release of each port with distfiles that have already been
	    fetched.  However, as the Internet continually changes,
	    distfiles can quickly go missing.  The <ulink
	    url="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~fenner/portsurvey/">FreeBSD
	    Ports distfiles survey</ulink> attempts to query every
	    download site for every port to find out if each distfile
	    is still currently available.  Maintainers are asked to
	    check this report periodically, not only to speed up the
	    building process for users, but to help avoid wasting
	    bandwidth of the sites that volunteer to host all these
	    distfiles.</para>

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="portsmon">

	<title>The &os; Ports Monitoring System</title>

	<para>Another handy resource is the
	  <ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org">
	  FreeBSD Ports Monitoring System</ulink> (also known as
	  <literal>portsmon</literal>).  This system comprises a
	  database that processes information from several sources
	  and allows its to be browsed via a web interface.  Currently,
	  the ports Problem Reports (PRs), the error logs from
	  the build cluster, and individual files from the ports
	  collection are used.  In the future, this will be expanded
	  to include the distfile survey, as well as other sources.</para>

	<para>To get started, you can view all information about a
	  particular port by using the
	  <ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">
	  Overview of One Port</ulink>.</para>

	<para>As of this writing, this is the only resource available
	  that maps GNATS PR entries to portnames.  (PR submitters
	  do not always include the portname in their Synopsis, although
	  we would prefer that they did.)  So, <literal>portsmon</literal>
	  is a good place to start if you want to find out whether an
	  existing port has any PRs filed against it and/or any build
	  errors; or, to find out if a new port that you may be thinking
	  about creating has already been submitted.</para>

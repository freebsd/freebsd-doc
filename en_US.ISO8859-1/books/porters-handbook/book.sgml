      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD ports collection is the way almost everyone
	installs applications ("ports") on FreeBSD.  Like everything
 	else about FreeBSD, it is primarily a volunteer effort.
 	It is important to keep this in mind when reading this
 	document.</para>
 
      <para>In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer
 	to maintain an existing port if it is unmaintained&mdash;you
 	do not need any special commit privileges to do so.</para>

    </chapter>

    <chapter id="own-port">
      <title>Making a port yourself</title>

      <para>So, you are interested in making your own port or
	upgrading an existing one?  Great!</para>

      <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
	FreeBSD.  If you want to upgrade an existing port, you should
	read this and then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading">.</para>

      <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed, you should
	refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which
	all port Makefiles include.  Even if you do not hack Makefiles
	daily, it is well commented, and you will still gain much
	knowledge from it.  Additionally, you may send specific questions
	to the &a.ports;.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Only a fraction of the variables
	  (<makevar><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></makevar>) that can be
	  overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not all)
	  are documented at the start of <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>;
	  the others probably ought to be.
	  Note that this file uses a non-standard tab setting:
	  <application>Emacs</application> and
	  <application>Vim</application> should recognize the setting on
	  loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and
	  &man.ex.1; can be set to use the correct value by
	  typing <command>:set tabstop=4</command> once the file has been
	  loaded.</para>

    <chapter id="quick-porting">
      <title>Quick Porting</title>

      <para>This section tells you how to do a quick port.  In many cases, it
	is not sufficient, so you will have to read further on into
	the document.</para>

      <para>First, get the original tarball and put it into
	<makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>, which defaults to
	<filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The following assumes that the software compiled out-of-the-box,
	  i.e., there was absolutely no change required for the port to work
	  on your FreeBSD box.  If you needed to change something, you will
	  have to refer to the next section too.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-makefile">
	<title>Writing the <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

	<para>The minimal <filename>Makefile</filename> would look something
	  like this:</para>

	<para>See if you can figure it out.  Do not worry about the contents
	  of the <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal> line, it will be
	  filled in automatically by CVS when the port is imported to our main
	  ports tree.  You can find a more detailed example in the <link

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="porting-desc">
	<title>Writing the description files</title>

	<para>There are two description files that are required for
	  any port, whether they actually package or not. They are
	  <filename>pkg-descr</filename> and
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  Their
	  <filename>pkg-</filename> prefix distinguishes them from
	  other files.</para>

	<sect2>
	  <title><filename>pkg-descr</filename></title>

	  <para>This is a longer description of the port.  One to a few
	    paragraphs concisely explaining what the port does is
	    sufficient.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a manual or an in-depth
	      description on how to use or compile the port! <emphasis>Please
	      be careful if you are copying from the
	      <filename>README</filename> or manpage</emphasis>; too often
	      they are not a concise description of the port or are in an
	      awkward format (e.g., manpages have justified spacing).  If the
	      ported software has an official WWW homepage, you should list it
	      here.  Prefix <emphasis>one</emphasis> of the websites with
	      <literal>WWW:</literal> so that automated tools will work
	      correctly.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>It is recommended that you sign your name at the end of this
	    file, as in:</para>

	  <title><filename>pkg-plist</filename></title>

	  <para>This file lists all the files installed by the port.  It is
	    also called the <quote>packing list</quote> because the package is
	    generated by packing the files listed here.  The pathnames are
	    relative to the installation prefix (usually
	    <filename>/usr/local</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename>).  If you are using the
	    <makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar> variables (as
	    you should be), do not list any manpages here.</para>

	  <para>Here is a small example:</para>

	  <programlisting>bin/oneko
lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	  <para>Refer to the &man.pkg.create.1; manual page for details on the
	    packing list.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>You should list all the files, but not the name directories,
	      in the list.  Also, if the port creates directories for itself
	      during installation, make sure to add <literal>@dirrm</literal>
	      lines as necessary to remove them when the port is
	      deleted.</para>

	    <para>It is recommended that you keep all the filenames in this
	      file sorted alphabetically.  It will make verifying the changes
	      when you upgrade the port much easier.</para>

	    <para>Creating a packing list manually can be a very tedious
	      task.  If the port installs a large numbers of files, <link
		linkend="porting-autoplist">creating the packing list
		automatically</link> might save time.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-portlint">
	<title>Checking your port with <command>portlint</command></title>

	<para>Please use <command>portlint</command> to see if your port
	  conforms to our guidelines.  The <command>portlint</command> program
	  is part of the ports collection.  In particular, you may want to
	  check if the <link linkend="porting-samplem">Makefile</link> is in
	  the right shape and the <link
	    linkend="porting-pkgname">package</link> is named

      <sect1 id="porting-submitting">
	<title>Submitting the port</title>

	<para>First, make sure you have read the <link
	    linkend="porting-dads">DOs and DON'Ts</link> section.</para>

	<para>Now that you are happy with your port, the only thing remaining
	  is to put it in the main FreeBSD ports tree and make everybody else
	  happy about it too.  We do not need your <filename>work</filename>
	  directory or the <filename>pkgname.tgz</filename> package, so delete
	  them now.  Next, simply include the output of <command>shar `find
	    port_dir`</command> in a bug report and send it with the
	    &man.send-pr.1; program (see <ulink url="../../articles/contributing/contrib-how.html#CONTRIB-GENERAL">Bug
	    Reports and General Commentary</ulink> for more information about
	    &man.send-pr.1;).  If the uncompressed port is larger than 20KB,
	  you should compress it into a tarfile and use &man.uuencode.1;
	  before including it in the bug report (uuencoded tarfiles are
	  acceptable even if the bug report is smaller than 20KB but are not
	  preferred).  Be sure to classify the bug report as category
	  <literal>ports</literal> and class
	  <literal>change-request</literal>  (Do not mark the report
	  <literal>confidential</literal>!).
	  Also add a short description of the program you ported
	  to the <quote>Description</quote> field of the PR and
	  the shar or uuencoded tarfile to the
	  <quote>Fix</quote> field.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>You can make our work a lot easier, if you use a good
	    description in the synopsis of the problem report.
	    We prefer something like
	    <quote>New port: &lt;category&gt;/&lt;portname&gt;
	    &lt;short description of the port&gt;</quote> for new ports and
	    <quote>Update port: &lt;category&gt;/&lt;portname&gt;
	    &lt;short description of the update&gt;</quote> for port updates.
	    If you stick to this scheme, the chance that someone will take a
	    look at your PR soon is much better.</para>
	</note>

	<para>One more time, <emphasis>do not include the original source
	    distfile, the <filename>work</filename> directory, or the package
	    you built with <command>make package</command></emphasis>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In the past, we asked you to upload new port submissions in
	    our FTP site (<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>). This
	    is no longer recommended as read access is turned off on the
	    <filename>incoming/</filename> directory of that site due to the
	    large amount of pirated software showing up there.</para>
	</note>

	<para>After you have submitted your port, please be patient.
	  Sometimes it can take a few months before a port is included
	  in FreeBSD, although it might only take a few days.  You can
	  view the list of <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?category=ports">ports
	  waiting to be committed to FreeBSD</ulink>.</para>

	<para>Once we have looked at your port, we will get back to you if necessary, and put
	  it in the tree.  Your name will also appear in the list of
	  <ulink url="../../articles/contributors/contrib-additional.html">Additional FreeBSD Contributors</ulink>

    <chapter id="slow">
      <title>Slow Porting</title>

      <para>Ok, so it was not that simple, and the port required some

      <sect1 id="slow-work">
	<title>How things work</title>

	<para>First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when the user
	  first types <command>make</command> in your port's directory.
	  You may find that having <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> in another

	<para>But do not worry if you do not really understand what
	  <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> is doing, not many people do...
	  <!-- smiley --><emphasis>:-&gt;</emphasis></para>

	<procedure>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is run.  The
	      <maketarget>fetch</maketarget> target is responsible for making
	      sure that the tarball exists locally in
	      <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>. If <maketarget>fetch</maketarget>
	      cannot find the required files in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> it
	      will look up the URL <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, which is
	      set in the Makefile, as well as our main FTP site at <ulink
		url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/"></ulink>,
	      where we put sanctioned distfiles as backup.  It will then
	      attempt to fetch the named distribution file with
	      <makevar>FETCH</makevar>, assuming that the requesting site has
	      direct access to the Internet.  If that succeeds, it will save
	      the file in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> for future use and
	      proceed.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target is run.  It
	      looks for your port's distribution file (typically a gzip'd
	      tarball) in <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> and unpacks it into a
	      temporary subdirectory specified by <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar>
	      (defaults to <filename>work</filename>).</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>patch</maketarget> target is run.  First,
	      any patches defined in <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> are
	      applied.  Second, if any patch files named
	      <filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> are found in
	      <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> (defaults to the
	      <filename>files</filename> subdirectory), they are applied at
	      this time in alphabetical order.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>configure</maketarget> target is run.  This
	      can do any one of many different things.</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>If it exists, <filename>scripts/configure</filename> is
		  run.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>If <makevar>HAS_CONFIGURE</makevar> or
		  <makevar>GNU_CONFIGURE</makevar> is set,
		  <filename><makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>/configure</filename> is
		  run.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>If <makevar>USE_IMAKE</makevar> is set,
		  <makevar>XMKMF</makevar> (default: <command>xmkmf
		    -a</command>) is run.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </orderedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The <maketarget>build</maketarget> target is run.  This is
	      responsible for descending into the port's private working
	      directory (<makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) and building it.  If
	      <makevar>USE_GMAKE</makevar> is set, GNU <command>make</command>
	      will be used, otherwise the system <command>make</command> will
	      be used.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>The above are the default actions.  In addition, you can define
	  targets
	  <maketarget>pre-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget> or
	  <maketarget>post-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>,
	  or put scripts with those names, in the <filename>scripts</filename>
	  subdirectory, and they will be run before or after the default
	  actions are done.</para>

	<para>For example, if you have a <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget>
	  target defined in your <filename>Makefile</filename>, and a file
	  <filename>pre-build</filename> in the <filename>scripts</filename>
	  subdirectory, the <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target will
	  be called after the regular extraction actions, and the
	  <filename>pre-build</filename> script will be executed before the
	  default build rules are done.  It is recommended that you use
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> targets if the actions are simple
	  enough, because it will be easier for someone to figure out what
	  kind of non-default action the port requires.</para>

	<para>The default actions are done by the
	  <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> targets
	  <maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>.
	  For example, the commands to extract a port are in the target
	  <maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>.  If you are not happy with the
	  default target, you can fix it by redefining the
	  <maketarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></maketarget>
	  target in your <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <quote>main</quote> targets (e.g.,
	    <maketarget>extract</maketarget>,
	    <maketarget>configure</maketarget>, etc.) do nothing more than
	    make sure all  the stages up to that one are completed and call
	    the real targets or scripts, and they are not intended to be
	    changed.  If you want to fix the extraction, fix
	    <maketarget>do-extract</maketarget>, but never ever change
	    the way <maketarget>extract</maketarget> operates!</para>
	</note>

	<para>Now that you understand what goes on when the user types
	  <command>make</command>, let us go through the recommended steps to
	  create the perfect port.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="slow-sources">
	<title>Getting the original sources</title>

	<para>Get the original sources (normally) as a compressed tarball
	  (<filename><replaceable>foo</replaceable>.tar.gz</filename> or
	  <filename><replaceable>foo</replaceable>.tar.Z</filename>) and copy
	  it into <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>.  Always use
	  <emphasis>mainstream</emphasis> sources when and where you
	  can.</para>

	<para>You will need to set the variable <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>
	  to reflect where the original tarball resides.  You will find
	  convenient shorthand definitions for most mainstream sites
	  in <filename>bsd.sites.mk</filename>.  Please use these
	  sites&mdash;and the associated definitions&mdash;if
	  at all possible, to help avoid the problem of having the same
	  information repeated over again many times in the source base.
	  As these sites tend to change over time, this becomes a
	  maintenance nightmare for everyone involved.</para>

	<para>If you cannot find a FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected to the
	  net, or can only find sites that have irritatingly non-standard
	  formats, you might want to put a copy on a reliable FTP or HTTP
	  server that you control (e.g., your home page).</para>

	<para>If you cannot find somewhere convenient and reliable to put the
	  distfile
	  we can <quote>house</quote> it ourselves
	  on <hostid>ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>; however, this is the
	  least-preferred solution.
	  The distfile must be placed into
	  <filename>~/public_distfiles/</filename> of someone's
	  <hostid>freefall</hostid> account.
	  Ask the person who commits your port to do this.
	  This person will also set <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> to
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_LOCAL</makevar> and
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> to their
	  <hostid>freefall</hostid> username.</para>

	<para>If your port's distfile changes all the time without any
	  kind of version update by the author,
	  consider putting the distfile on your home page and listing it as
	  the first <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  If you can, try
	  to talk the port author out of doing this; it
	  really does help to establish some kind of source code control.
	  Hosting your own version will prevent users
	  from getting <errorname>checksum mismatch</errorname> errors, and
	  also reduce the workload of maintainers of our FTP site.  Also, if
	  there is only one master site for the port, it is recommended that
	  you house a backup at your site and list it as the second
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.</para>

	<para>If your port requires some additional `patches' that are
	  available on the Internet, fetch them too and put them in
	  <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar>.  Do not worry if they come from a site
	  other than where you got the main source tarball, we have a way to
	  handle these situations (see the description of <link

	  or modification of files should be doable using an automated script

	<para>If your port requires significant user interaction/customization
	  to compile or install, you should take a look at one of Larry Wall's
	  classic <application>Configure</application> scripts and perhaps do
	  something similar yourself.  The goal of the new ports collection is
	  to make each port as <quote>plug-and-play</quote> as possible for the
	  end-user while using a minimum of disk space.</para>

	<title>Patching</title>

	<para>In the preparation of the port, files that have been added or
	  changed can be picked up with a recursive &man.diff.1;
	  for later feeding to &man.patch.1;.  Each set of patches you
	  wish to apply should be collected into a file named
	  <filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> where
	  <replaceable>*</replaceable> denotes the sequence in which the
	  patches will be applied &mdash; these are done in
	  <emphasis>alphabetical order</emphasis>, thus <literal>aa</literal>
	  first, <literal>ab</literal> second and so on.  If you wish,
	  you can use names that indicate the pathnames of the files that
	  are patched, such as <filename>patch-Imakefile</filename> or
	  <filename>patch-src-config.h</filename>.  These files should
	  be stored in <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar>, from where they will be
	  automatically applied.  All patches should be relative to
	  <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar> (generally the directory your port's
	  tarball unpacks itself into, that being where the build is done).
	  To make fixes and upgrades easier, you should avoid having more than
	  one patch fix the same file (e.g., <filename>patch-aa</filename> and
	  <filename>patch-ab</filename> both changing
	  <filename><makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>/foobar.c</filename>).</para>

	<para>Do not put RCS strings in patches.  CVS will mangle them when we
	  put the files into the ports tree, and when we check them out again,
	  they will come out different and the patch will fail.  RCS strings
	  are surrounded by dollar (<literal>&dollar;</literal>) signs, and
	  typically start with <literal>&dollar;Id</literal> or
	  <literal>&dollar;RCS</literal>.</para>

	<para>Using the recurse (<option>-r</option>) option to
	  &man.diff.1; to generate patches is fine, but please take
	  a look at the resulting patches to make sure you do not have any
	  unnecessary junk in there.  In particular, diffs between two backup
	  files, <filename>Makefile</filename>s when the port uses
	  <command>Imake</command> or GNU <command>configure</command>, etc.,
	  are unnecessary and should be deleted.  If you had to edit
	  <filename>configure.in</filename> and run
	  <command>autoconf</command> to regenerate
	  <command>configure</command>, do not take the diffs of
	  <command>configure</command> (it often grows to a few thousand
	  lines!); define <literal>USE_AUTOCONF=yes</literal> and take the
	  diffs of <filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

	<para>Also, if you had to delete a file, then you can do it in the
	  <maketarget>post-extract</maketarget> target rather than as part of
	  the patch.  Once you are happy with the resulting diff, please split
	  it up into one source file per patch file.</para>

	  <para>A rule of thumb is to ask yourself whether a change

	    enhancement, fix, or by virtue that the new package will
	    actually work at all), and weigh that against that fact

	  <title><makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar></title>

	  <para>From time to time a software vendor or FreeBSD porter
	    will do something silly and release a version of their
	    software which is actually numerically less than the
	    previous version. An example of this is a port which goes
	    from foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be
	    incorrectly treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a
	    numerically greater value than 1).</para>

	  <para>In situations such as this, the
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> version should be increased.
	    If <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> is nonzero it is appended
	    to the package name as described in section 0 above.
	    <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> must never be decreased or reset
	    to zero, because that would cause comparison to a package
	    from an earlier epoch to fail (i.e. the package would not
	    be detected as out of date): the new version number (e.g.
	    <literal>1.0,1</literal> in the above example) is still
	    numerically less than the previous version (20000801), but
	    the <literal>,1</literal> suffix is treated specially by
	    automated tools and found to be greater than the implied
	    suffix <literal>,0</literal> on the earlier package.</para>

	  <para>Dropping or resetting <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar>
	    incorrectly leads
	    to no end of grief; if you do not understand the above discussion,
	    please keep after it until you do, or ask questions on
	    the mailing lists.</para>

	  <para>It is expected that <makevar>PORTEPOCH</makevar> will
	    not be used for the majority of ports, and that sensible
	    use of <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> can often pre-empt
	    it becoming necessary if a future release of the software
	    should change the version structure. However, care is
	    needed by FreeBSD porters when a vendor release is made
	    without an official version number &mdash; such as a code
	    <quote>snapshot</quote> release.  The temptation is to label the
	    release with the release date, which will cause problems
	    as in the example above when a new <quote>official</quote> release is
	    made.</para>

	  <para>For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date
	    20000917, and the previous version of the software was
	    version 1.2, the snapshot release should be given a
	    <makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> of 1.2.20000917 or similar,
	    not 20000917, so that the succeeding release, say 1.3, is
	    still a numerically greater value.</para>

	<para>When a package is created, it is put under
	  <filename>/usr/ports/packages/All</filename> and links are made from
	  one or more subdirectories of
	  <filename>/usr/ports/packages</filename>.  The names of these
	  subdirectories are specified by the variable
	  <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar>.  It is intended to make life easier
	  for the user when he is wading through the pile of packages on the
	  FTP site or the CDROM.  Please take a look at the existing <link
	    linkend="porting-categories">categories</link> and pick the ones
	  that are suitable for your port.</para>

	<para>This list also determines where in the ports tree the port is
	  imported.  If you put more than one category here, it is assumed
	  that the port files will be put in the subdirectory with the name in
	  the first category.  See the <link
	    linkend="porting-categories">categories</link> section for more
	  discussion about how to pick the right categories.</para>

	<para>If your port truly belongs to something that is different from
	  all the existing ones, you can even create a new category name.  In
	  that case, please send mail to the &a.ports; to propose a new
	  category.  However, in general, until there are more than a
	  handful of ports which could be reclassified into the category
	  you propose, you will probably be turned down.</para>

	<note><para>Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the categories
	  with either a 2-level structure, or some other kind of keyword
	  structure.  To date, nothing has come of any of these proposals
	  because, while they are very easy to make, the effort involved to
	  retrofit the entire existing ports collection with any kind of
	  reorganization is daunting to say the very least.  Please read
	  the history of these proposals in the mailing list archives before
	  you post this idea; furthermore, you should be prepared to be
	  challenged to offer a working prototype.</para></note>

	<title>Choosing the right category</title>

	<para>As many of the categories overlap, you often have to choose
	  which of the categories should be the primary category of your port.
	  There are several rules that govern this issue.  Here is the list of
	  priorities, in decreasing order of precedence:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Language specific categories always come first.  For
	      example, if your port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then your
	      <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> line would read <filename>japanese
		x11-fonts</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Specific categories win over less-specific ones.  For
	      instance, an HTML editor should be listed as <filename>www
		editors</filename>, not the other way around.  Also, you should not
	      list <filename>net</filename> when the port belongs to
	      any of <filename>irc</filename>, <filename>mail</filename>,
	      <filename>mbone</filename>, <filename>news</filename>,
	      <filename>security</filename>, or <filename>www</filename>, as
	      <filename>net</filename> is included implicitly.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>x11</filename> is used as a secondary category only
	      when the primary category is a natural language.  In particular,
	      you should not put <filename>x11</filename> in the category line
	      for X applications.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><application>Emacs</application> modes should be
	      placed in the same ports category as the application
	      supported by the mode, not in
	      <filename>editors</filename>.  For example, an
	      <application>Emacs</application> mode to edit source
	      files of some programming language should go into
	      <filename>lang</filename>.
	      </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If your port truly does not belong anywhere else, put it in
	      <filename>misc</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If you are not sure about the category, please put a comment to
	  that effect in your &man.send-pr.1; submission so we can
	  discuss it before we import it.  If you are a committer, send a note
	  to the &a.ports; so we can discuss it first.  Too often, new ports are
	  imported to the wrong category only to be moved right away.
	  This causes unnecessary and undesirable bloat in the master
	  source repository.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="makefile-distfiles">
      <title>The distribution files</title>

      <para>The second part of the <filename>Makefile</filename> describes the
	files that must be downloaded in order to build the port, and where
	they can be downloaded from.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTNAME</makevar></title>

	<para><makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is the name of the port as
	  called by the authors of the software.
	  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> defaults to
	  <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>, so override it only if necessary.
	  <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> is only used in two places.
	  First, the distribution file list
	  (<makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>) defaults to
	  <makevar>${DISTNAME}</makevar><makevar>${EXTRACT_SUFX}</makevar>.
	  Second, the distribution file is expected to extract into a
	  subdirectory named <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>, which defaults
	  to <filename>work/<makevar>${DISTNAME}</makevar></filename>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para><makevar>PKGNAMEPREFIX</makevar> and
	    <makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar> do not affect
	    <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar>.  Also note that if
	    <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar> is equal to
	    <filename>work/<makevar>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</makevar></filename>
	    while the original source archive is named something other than
	    <makevar>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}${EXTRACT_SUFX}</makevar>,
	    you should probably leave <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar>
	    alone&mdash; you are better off defining
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> than having to set both
	    <makevar>DISTNAME</makevar> and <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>
	    (and possibly <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>).</para>

	<title><makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar></title>

	<para>Record the directory part of the FTP/HTTP-URL pointing at the
	  original tarball in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  Do not forget
	  the trailing slash (<filename>/</filename>)!</para>

	<para>The <command>make</command> macros will try to use this
	  specification for grabbing the distribution file with
	  <makevar>FETCH</makevar> if they cannot find it already on the
	  system.</para>

	<para>It is recommended that you put multiple sites on this list,
	  preferably from different continents.  This will safeguard against
	  wide-area network problems.  We are even planning to add support
	  for automatically determining the closest master site and fetching
	  from there; having multiple sites will go a long way towards
	  helping this effort.</para>

	<para>If the original tarball is part of one of the popular
	  archives such as X-contrib, GNU, or Perl CPAN, you may be able
	  refer to those sites in an easy compact form using
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar>
	  (e.g., <makevar>MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB</makevar> and
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_PERL_GNU</makevar>).  Simply set
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> to one of these variables and
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> to the path within the
	  archive.  Here is an example:</para>

	<programlisting>MASTER_SITES=         ${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR=   applications</programlisting>

	<para>These variables are defined in
	  <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.sites.mk</filename>.  There are
	  new entries added all the time, so make sure to check the
	  latest version of this file before submitting a port.</para>

	<para>The user can also set the <makevar>MASTER_SITE_*</makevar>
	  variables in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> to override our
	  choices, and use their favorite mirrors of these popular archives
	  instead.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar></title>

	<para>If you have one distribution file, and it uses an odd suffix to
	  indicate the compression mechanism, set
	  <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>.</para>

	<para>For example, if the distribution file was named
	  <filename>foo.tgz</filename> instead of the more normal
	  <filename>foo.tar.gz</filename>, you would write:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTNAME=      foo
EXTRACT_SUFX=  .tgz</programlisting>

	<para>The <makevar>USE_BZIP2</makevar> and <makevar>USE_ZIP</makevar>
	  variables automatically set <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar> to
	  <literal>.bz2</literal> or <literal>.zip</literal> as necessary.  If
	  neither of these are set then <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar>
	  defaults to <literal>.tar.gz</literal>.</para>

        <note>
	  <para>You never need to set both <makevar>EXTRACT_SUFX</makevar> and
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>.</para>
        </note>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>DISTFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>Sometimes the names of the files to be downloaded have no
	  resemblance to the name of the port.  For example, it might be
	  called <filename>source.tar.gz</filename> or similar.  In other
	  cases the application's source code might be in several different
	  archives, all of which must be downloaded.</para>

	<para>If this is the case, set <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> to be a
	  space separated list of all the files that must be
	  downloaded.</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=     source1.tar.gz source2.tar.gz</programlisting>

	<para>If not explicitly set, <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> defaults to
	  <literal>${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}</literal>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><makevar>EXTRACT_ONLY</makevar></title>

	<para>If only some of the <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> must be
	  extracted&mdash;for example, one of them is the source code, while
	  another is an uncompressed document&mdash;list the filenames that
	  must be extracted in <makevar>EXTRACT_ONLY</makevar>.</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=     source.tar.gz manual.html
EXTRACT_ONLY=  source.tar.gz</programlisting>

	<para>If <emphasis>none</emphasis> of the <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar>
	  should be uncompressed then set <makevar>EXTRACT_ONLY</makevar> to
	  the empty string.</para>

	<programlisting>EXTRACT_ONLY=</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="porting-patchfiles">
	<title><makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar></title>

	<para>If your port requires some additional patches that are available
	  by FTP or HTTP, set <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> to the names of
	  the files and <makevar>PATCH_SITES</makevar> to the URL of the
	  directory that contains them (the format is the same as
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>).</para>

	<para>If the patch is not relative to the top of the source tree
	  (i.e., <makevar>WRKSRC</makevar>) because it contains some extra
	  pathnames, set <makevar>PATCH_DIST_STRIP</makevar> accordingly. For
	  instance, if all the pathnames in the patch have an extra
	  <literal>foozolix-1.0/</literal> in front of the filenames, then set
	  <literal>PATCH_DIST_STRIP=-p1</literal>.</para>

	<para>Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be
	  decompressed automatically if the filenames end with
	  <filename>.gz</filename> or <filename>.Z</filename>.</para>

	<para>If the patch is distributed with some other files, such as
	  documentation, in a gzip'd tarball, you cannot just use
	  <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar>.  If that is the case, add the name
	  and the location of the patch tarball to
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.
	  Then, use the <makevar>EXTRA_PATCHES</makevar> variable to
	  point to those files and <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>
	  will automatically apply them for you.  In particular, do
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy patch files into the
	  <makevar>PATCHDIR</makevar> directory&mdash;that directory may
	  not be writable.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The tarball will have been extracted alongside the
	    regular source by then, so there is no need to explicitly extract
	    it if it is a regular gzip'd or compress'd tarball. If you do the
	    latter, take extra care not to overwrite something that already
	    exists in that directory.  Also, do not forget to add a command to
	    remove the copied patch in the <maketarget>pre-clean</maketarget>
	    target.</para>

      <sect2 id="porting-master-sites-n">
	<title>Multiple distribution files or patches from different
	  sites and subdirectories
	  (<literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>)</title>

	<para>(Consider this to be a somewhat <quote>advanced topic</quote>;
	  those new to this document may wish to skip this section at first).
	  </para>

	<para>This section has information on the fetching mechanism
	  known as both <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> and
	  <literal>MASTER_SITES_NN</literal>.  We will refer to this
	  mechanism as <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	  hereon.</para>

	<para>A little background first.  OpenBSD has a neat feature
	  inside both <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  <makevar>PATCHFILES</makevar> variables, both files and
	  patches can be postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
	  identifiers where <literal>n</literal> both can be
	  <literal>[0-9]</literal> and denote a group designation.
	  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=      alpha:0 beta:1</programlisting>

	<para>In OpenBSD, distribution file <filename>alpha</filename>
	  will be associated with variable
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES0</makevar> instead of our common
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> and
	  <filename>beta</filename> with
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES1</makevar>.</para>

	<para>This is a very interesting feature which can decrease
	  that endless search for the correct download site.</para>

	<para>Just picture 2 files in <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and
	  20 sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, the sites slow
	  as hell where <filename>beta</filename> is carried by all
	  sites in <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>, and
	  <filename>alpha</filename> can only be found in the 20th
	  site.  It would be such a waste to check all of them if
	  maintainer knew this beforehand, would not it?  Not a good
	  start for that lovely weekend!</para>

	<para>Now that you got the picture, just imagine more
	  <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> and more
	  <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar>.  Surely our
	  <quote>distfiles survey meister</quote> would appreciate the
	  network strain relieve this would bring.</para>

	<para>In the next sections, information will follow on the
	  FreeBSD implementation of this idea.	We improved a bit on
	  OpenBSD's concept.</para>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Simplified information</title>

	  <para>This section tells you how to quickly prepare fine
	    grained fetching of multiple distribution files and
	    patches from different sites and subdirectories.  We
	    describe here a case of simplified
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> usage.  This will be
	    sufficient for most scenarios.  However, if you need
	    further information, you will have to refer to the next
	    section.</para>

	  <para>Some applications consist of multiple distribution
	    files that must be downloaded from a number of different
	    sites.  For example,
	    <application>Ghostscript</application> consists of the
	    core of the program, and then a large number of driver
	    files that are used depending on the user's printer.  Some
	    of these driver files are supplied with the core, but many
	    others must be downloaded from a variety of different
	    sites.</para>

	  <para>To support this, each entry in
	    <makevar>DISTFILES</makevar> may be followed by a colon
	    and a <quote>tag name</quote>.  Each site listed in
	    <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> is then followed by a
	    colon, and the tag that indicates which distribution files
	    should be downloaded from this site.</para>

	  <para>For example, consider an application with the source
	    split in two parts, <filename>source1.tar.gz</filename>
	    and <filename>source2.tar.gz</filename>, which must be
	    downloaded from two different sites.  The port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would include lines like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	      with 1 file per site</title>

		ftp://ftp.example2.com/:source2
DISTFILES=      source1.tar.gz:source1 \
		source2.tar.gz:source2</programlisting>
	  </example>

	  <para>Multiple distribution files can have the same tag.
	    Continuing the previous example, suppose that there was a
	    third distfile, <filename>source3.tar.gz</filename>, that
	    should be downloaded from
	    <hostid>ftp.example2.com</hostid>.	The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would then be written like
	    <xref
	      linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">.</para>

	  <example
	    id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>

	  </example>

	  <title>Detailed information</title>

	  <para>Okay, so the previous section example did not reflect
	    your needs?	 In this section we will explain in detail how
	    the fine grained fetching mechanism
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> works and how you can
	    modify your ports to use it.</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements can be postfixed with
		<literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> where
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> is
		<literal>[^:,]+</literal>, i.e.,
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> could conceptually be any
		alphanumeric string but we will limit it to
		<literal>[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]+</literal> for
		now.</para>

	      <para>Moreover, string matching is case sensitive;
		i.e., <literal>n</literal> is different from
		<literal>N</literal>.</para>

	      <para>However, the following words cannot be used for
		postfixing purposes since they yield special meaning:
		<literal>default</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and
		<literal>ALL</literal> (they are used internally in
		item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-what-changes-in-port-targets">).
		Furthermore, <literal>DEFAULT</literal> is a special
		purpose word (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
		belong to the group <literal>n</literal>,
		<literal>:m</literal> belong to group
		<literal>m</literal> and so forth.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">
	      <para>Elements without a postfix are groupless, i.e.,
		they all belong to the special group
		<literal>DEFAULT</literal>.  If you postfix any
		elements with <literal>DEFAULT</literal>, you are just
		being redundant unless you want to have an element
		belonging to both <literal>DEFAULT</literal> and other
		groups at the same time (check item <xref
		  linkend="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">).</para>

	      <para>The following examples are equivalent but the
		first one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=   alpha

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Groups are not exclusive, an element may belong to
		several different groups at the same time and a group
		can either have either several different elements or
		none at all.  Repeated elements within the same group

	    </listitem>

	    <listitem id="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">
	      <para>When you want an element to belong to several
		groups at the same time, you can use the comma
		operator (<literal>,</literal>).</para>

	      <para>Instead of repeating it several times, each time
		with a different postfix, we can list several groups
		at once in a single postfix.  For instance,
		<literal>:m,n,o</literal> marks an element that
		belongs to group <literal>m</literal>,
		<literal>n</literal> and <literal>o</literal>.</para>

	      <para>All the following examples are equivalent but the

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT alpha:SOME_SITE

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:SOME_SITE,DEFAULT

MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT,SOME_SITE</programlisting>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>All sites within a given group are sorted

		    be terminated with the forward slash
		    <literal>/</literal> character.  If any elements
		    belong to any groups, the group postfix
		    <literal>:<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>
		    must come right after the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal>.  The
		    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> mechanism relies
		    on the existence of the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal> to avoid confusing elements
		    where a <literal>:n</literal> is a valid part of
		    the element with occurrences where
		    <literal>:n</literal> denotes group
		    <literal>n</literal>.  For compatibility purposes,
		    since the <literal>/</literal> terminator was not
		    required before in both
		    <makevar>MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> and
		    <makevar>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</makevar> elements, if
		    the postfix immediate preceding character is not
		    a <literal>/</literal> then <literal>:n</literal>
		    will be considered a valid part of the element
		    instead of a group postfix even if an element is
		    postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>.  See both

	<para>Do not let your port clutter

	  <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles/<makevar>DIST_SUBDIR</makevar></filename>,

	<para>It will also look at the subdirectory with the same name on the

	  (Setting <makevar>DISTDIR</makevar> explicitly in your

	<para>Many ports depend on other ports.  There are seven variables that

	  variables for common cases, plus a few more to control the behavior
	  of dependencies.</para>

	<sect2>
	  <title><makevar>LIB_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	  <para>This variable specifies the shared libraries this port depends
	    on.  It is a list of
	    <replaceable>lib</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	    tuples where <replaceable>lib</replaceable> is the name of the
	    shared library, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the
	    directory in which to find it in case it is not available, and
	    <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the target to call in that
	    directory.  For example, <programlisting> LIB_DEPENDS=
	      jpeg.9:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg:install</programlisting>
	    will check for a shared jpeg library with major version 9, and
	    descend into the <filename>graphics/jpeg</filename> subdirectory
	    of your ports tree to build and install it if it is not found.
	    The <replaceable>target</replaceable> part can be omitted if it is
	    equal to <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar> (which defaults to
	    <literal>install</literal>).</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>The <replaceable>lib</replaceable> part is an argument given
	      to <command>ldconfig -r | grep -wF</command>.  There shall be no
	      regular expressions in this variable.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The dependency is checked twice, once from within the
	    <maketarget>extract</maketarget> target and then from within the
	    <maketarget>install</maketarget> target.  Also, the name of the
	    dependency is put into the package so that
	    &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically install it if it is
	    not on the user's system.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title><makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	  <para>This variable specifies executables or files this port depends
	    on during run-time.  It is a list of
	    <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	    tuples where <replaceable>path</replaceable> is the name of the
	    executable or file, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the
	    directory in which to find it in case it is not available, and
	    <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the target to call in that
	    directory.  If <replaceable>path</replaceable> starts with a slash
	    (<literal>/</literal>), it is treated as a file and its existence
	    is  tested with <command>test -e</command>; otherwise, it is
	    assumed to be an executable, and <command>which -s</command> is
	    used to determine if the program exists in the user's search
	    path.</para>

	  <para>For example,</para>

	    <programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=   ${LOCALBASE}/etc/innd:${PORTSDIR}/news/inn \
	       wish8.0:${PORTSDIR}/x11-toolkits/tk80</programlisting>

	  <para>will check if the file or directory
	    <filename>/usr/local/etc/innd</filename> exists, and build and
	    install it from the <filename>news/inn</filename> subdirectory of
	    the ports tree if it is not found.  It will also see if an
	    executable called <command>wish8.0</command> is in your search
	    path, and descend into the <filename>x11-toolkits/tk80</filename>
	    subdirectory of your ports tree to build and install it if it is
	    not found.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>In this case, <command>innd</command> is actually an
	      executable; if an executable is in a place that is not expected
	      to be in a normal user's search path, you should use the full
	      pathname.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The dependency is checked from within the
	    <maketarget>install</maketarget> target.  Also, the name of the
	    dependency is put into the  package so that
	    &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically install it if it is
	    not on the user's system.  The <replaceable>target</replaceable>
	    part can be omitted if it is the same as
	    <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar>.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title><makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	  <para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	    requires to build.  Like <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar>, it is a
	    list of
	    <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	    tuples. For example, <programlisting> BUILD_DEPENDS=
	      unzip:${PORTSDIR}/archivers/unzip</programlisting> will check
	    for an executable called <command>unzip</command>, and descend
	    into the <filename>archivers/unzip</filename> subdirectory of your
	    ports tree to build and install it if it is not found.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para><quote>build</quote> here means everything from extraction to

	    requires to fetch.  Like the previous two, it is a list of
	    <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional><replaceable>:target</replaceable></optional>
	    tuples.  For example, <programlisting> FETCH_DEPENDS=
	      ncftp2:${PORTSDIR}/net/ncftp2</programlisting> will check for an
	    executable called <command>ncftp2</command>, and descend into the
	    <filename>net/ncftp2</filename> subdirectory of your ports tree to

	  <para>The dependency is checked from within the

	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title><makevar>EXTRACT_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	    tuples.  For example, <programlisting>EXTRACT_DEPENDS=
	      unzip:${PORTSDIR}/archivers/unzip</programlisting> will check
	    for an executable called <command>unzip</command>, and descend
	    into the <filename>archivers/unzip</filename> subdirectory of

	  <para>The dependency is checked from within the

	  <title>Notes on dependencies</title>

	  <para>As mentioned above, the default target to call when a
	    dependency is required is <maketarget>DEPENDS_TARGET</maketarget>.
	    It defaults to <literal>install</literal>.  This is a user
	    variable; it is never defined in a port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename>.  If your port needs a special way
	    to handle a dependency, use the <literal>:target</literal> part of
	    the <makevar>*_DEPENDS</makevar> variables instead of redefining
	    <makevar>DEPENDS_TARGET</makevar>.</para>

	  <para>When you type <command>make clean</command>, its dependencies
	    are automatically cleaned too.  If you do not wish this to happen,
	    define the variable <makevar>NOCLEANDEPENDS</makevar> in your
	    environment.  This may be particularly desirable if the port
	    has something that takes a long time to rebuild in its
	    dependency list, such as KDE, GNOME or Mozilla.</para>

	  <para>To depend on another port unconditionally, use the
	    variable <makevar>${NONEXISTENT}</makevar> as the first field
	    of <makevar>BUILD_DEPENDS</makevar> or
	    <makevar>RUN_DEPENDS</makevar>.  Use this only when you need to
	    get the source of the other port.  You can often save
	    compilation time by specifying the target too.  For
	    instance

	    <programlisting>BUILD_DEPENDS=   ${NONEXISTENT}:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg:extract</programlisting>

	    will always descend to the <literal>jpeg</literal> port and extract it.</para>

	  <para>Do not use <makevar>DEPENDS</makevar> unless there is no other
	    way the behavior you want can be accomplished.  It will cause the
	    other port to always be built (and installed, by default), and the
	    dependency will go into the packages as well.  If this is really
	    what you need, you should probably write it as
	    <literal>BUILD_DEPENDS</literal> and
	    <literal>RUN_DEPENDS</literal> instead&mdash;at least the
	    intention will be clear.</para>

      <title>Optional dependencies</title>

      <para>Some large applications can be built in a number of
	configurations, adding functionality if one of a number of
	libraries or applications is available. Since not all users
	want those libraries or applications, the ports system
	provides hooks that the port author can use to decide which
	configuration should be built. Supporting these properly will
	make users happy, and effectively provide 2 or more ports for the
	price of one.</para>

      <para>The easiest of these to use is
	<makevar>WITHOUT_X11</makevar>. If the port can be built both
	with and without X support, then it should normally be built
	with X support. If <makevar>WITHOUT_X11</makevar> is defined,
	then the version that does not have X support should be
	built.</para>

      <para>Various parts of GNOME have such knobs, though they are
	slightly more difficult to use. The variables to use in the
	<filename>Makefile</filename> are <makevar>WANT_*</makevar>
	and <makevar>HAVE_*</makevar>. If the application can be
	built both with or without one of the dependencies listed
	below, then the <filename>Makefile</filename> should set
	<makevar>WANT_PKG</makevar>, and should build the version that
	uses <makevar>PKG</makevar> if <makevar>HAVE_PKG</makevar>
	is defined.</para>

      <para>The <makevar>WANT_*</makevar> variables currently
	supported this way are <makevar>WANT_GLIB</makevar>,
	<makevar>WANT_GTK</makevar>, <makevar>WANT_ESOUND</makevar>,
	<makevar>WANT_IMLIB</makevar>, and

        </important>

        <para>The ports building technology does not tolerate
          circular dependencies.  If you introduce one, you will have
          someone, somewhere in the world, whose FreeBSD installation will
          break almost immediately, with many others quickly to follow.
          These can really be hard to detect; if in doubt, before
          you make that change, make sure you have done the following:
          <command>cd /usr/ports; make index</command>.  That process
          can be quite slow on older machines, but you may be able to
          save a large number of people&mdash;including yourself&mdash;
          a lot of grief in the process.</para>

      <title>Special considerations</title>

      <para>There are some more things you have to take into account when you
	create a port.  This section explains the most common of those.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-shlibs">
	<title>Shared Libraries</title>

	<para>If your port installs one or more shared libraries, define a
	  <makevar>INSTALLS_SHLIB</makevar> make variable, which will instruct
	  a <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to run
	  <literal>&dollar;{LDCONFIG} -m</literal> on the directory where the
	  new library is installed (usually
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib</filename>) during
	  <maketarget>post-install</maketarget> target to register it into the
	  shared library cache.  This variable, when defined, will also
	  facilitate addition of an appropriate
	  <literal>@exec /sbin/ldconfig -m</literal> and
	  <literal>@unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R</literal> pair into your
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file, so that a user who installed
	  the package can start using the shared library immediately and
	  de-installation will not cause the system to still believe the
	  library is there.</para>

	<para>If you need, you can override the default location where the new
	  library is installed by defining the <makevar>LDCONFIG_DIRS</makevar>
	  make variable, which should contain a list of directories into which
	  shared libraries are to be installed.  For example if your port
	  installs shared libraries into
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/foo</filename> and
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/lib/bar</filename> directories
	  you could use the following in your
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>INSTALLS_SHLIB= yes
LDCONFIG_DIRS=  %%PREFIX%%/lib/foo %%PREFIX%%/lib/bar</programlisting>

	<para>Note that content of <makevar>LDCONFIG_DIRS</makevar> is passed
	  through &man.sed.1; just like the rest of <filename>pkg-plist</filename>,
	  so <makevar>PLIST_SUB</makevar> substitutions also apply here.  It is
	  recommended that you use <literal>%%PREFIX%%</literal> for
	  <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, <literal>%%LOCALBASE%%</literal> for
	  <makevar>LOCALBASE</makevar> and <literal>%%X11BASE%%</literal> for

	  it at compile time, set <makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar>.</para>

	<para><makevar>NO_PACKAGE</makevar> should be set to a string

	<para><makevar>NO_CDROM</makevar> should be set to a string

    <chapter>
      <title>ELF support</title>

      <para>Since FreeBSD changed to an ELF binary format shortly after
	3.0-RELEASE, we need to convert many ports that build shared
	libraries to support ELF.  Complicating this task is that a 3.0
	system can run as both ELF and a.out, and we wish to unofficially
	support the 2.2 branch as long as possible.  Below are the guidelines on
	how to convert a.out only ports to support both a.out and ELF
	compilation.</para>

      <para>Some part of this list is only applicable during the conversion,
	but will be left here for a while for reference in case you have come
	across some old port you wish to upgrade.</para>

      <sect1>
	<title>Moving a.out libraries out of the way</title>

	<para>Any a.out libraries should be moved out of
	  <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename> and similar to an
	  <filename>aout</filename> subdirectory.  (If you do not move them out
	  of the way, ELF ports will happily overwrite a.out libraries.) The
	  <maketarget>move-aout-libs</maketarget> target in the 3.0-CURRENT
	  <filename>src/Makefile</filename> (called from
	  <maketarget>aout-to-elf</maketarget>) will do this for you.  It will
	  only move a.out libs so it is safe to call it on a system with both
	  ELF and a.out libs in the standard directories.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
	<title>Format</title>

	<para>The ports tree will build packages in the format the machine is
	  in.  This means a.out for 2.2 and a.out or ELF for 3.0 depending on
	  what <command>`objformat`</command> returns.  Also, once users move
	  a.out libraries to a subdirectory, building a.out libraries will be
	  unsupported.  (I.e., it may still work if you know what you are
	  doing, but you are on your own.)</para>

	<note>
	  <para>If a port only works for a.out, set
	    <makevar>BROKEN_ELF</makevar> to a string describing the reason
	    why.  Such ports will be skipped during a build on an ELF
	    system.</para>
	</note>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
	<title><makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar></title>

	<para><filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> will set
	  <makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar> to <literal>aout</literal> or
	  <literal>elf</literal> and export it in the environments
	  <envar>CONFIGURE_ENV</envar>, <envar>SCRIPTS_ENV</envar> and
	  <envar>MAKE_ENV</envar>.  (It is always going to be
	  <literal>aout</literal> in 2.2-STABLE).  It is also passed to
	  <maketarget>PLIST_SUB</maketarget> as
	  <literal>PORTOBJFORMAT=${PORTOBJFORMAT}</literal>.  (See comment on
	  <literal>ldconfig</literal> lines below.)</para>

	<para>The variable is set using this line in
	  <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>PORTOBJFORMAT!= test -x /usr/bin/objformat && /usr/bin/objformat || echo aout</programlisting>

	<para>Ports' make processes should use this variable to decide what to
	  do.  However, if the port's <filename>configure</filename> script
	  already automatically detects an ELF system, it is not necessary to
	  refer to <makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar>.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
	<title>Building shared libraries</title>

	<para>The following are differences in handling shared libraries for
	  a.out and ELF.</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Shared library versions</para>

	    <para>An ELF shared library should be called
	      <filename>libfoo.so.<replaceable>M</replaceable></filename>
	      where <replaceable>M</replaceable> is the single version number,
	      and an a.out library should be called
	      <filename>libfoo.so.<replaceable>M</replaceable>.<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>
	      where <replaceable>M</replaceable> is the major version and
	      <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the minor version number.
	      Do not mix those; <emphasis>never</emphasis> install an ELF
	      shared library called
	      <filename>libfoo.so.<replaceable>N</replaceable>.<replaceable>M</replaceable></filename>
	      or an a.out shared library (or symlink) called
	      <filename>libfoo.so.<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Linker command lines</para>

	    <para>Assuming <command>cc -shared</command> is used rather than
	      <command>ld</command> directly, the only difference is that you
	      need to add
	      <option>-Wl,-<replaceable>soname,libfoo.so.M</replaceable></option>
	      on the command line for ELF.</para>
	    </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>You need to install a symlink from
	  <filename>libfoo.so</filename> to
	  <filename>libfoo.so.<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename> to make
	  ELF linkers happy.  Since it should be listed in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> too, and it won't hurt in the a.out case
	  (some ports even require the link for dynamic loading), you should
	  just make this link regardless of the setting of
	  <makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar>.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
	<title><makevar>LIB_DEPENDS</makevar></title>

	<para>All port <filename>Makefile</filename>s are edited to remove minor numbers from
	  <makevar>LIB_DEPENDS</makevar>, and also to have the regexp support
	  removed.  (E.g., <literal>foo\\.1\\.\\(33|40\\)</literal> becomes
	  <literal>foo.2</literal>.)  They will be matched using <command>grep
	    -wF</command>.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
	<title><filename>pkg-plist</filename></title>

	<para><filename>pkg-plist</filename> should contain the short (ELF) shlib
	  names if the a.out minor number is zero, and the long (a.out) names
	  otherwise.  <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> will automatically add
	  <literal>.0</literal> to the end of short shlib lines if
	  <makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar> equals <literal>aout</literal>, and
	  will delete the minor number from long shlib names if
	  <makevar>PORTOBJFORMAT</makevar> equals
	  <literal>elf</literal>.</para>

	<para>In cases where you really need to install shlibs with two
	  versions on an ELF system or those with one version on an a.out
	  system (for instance, ports that install compatibility libraries for
	  other operating systems), define the variable
	  <makevar>NO_FILTER_SHLIBS</makevar>.  This will turn off the editing
	  of <filename>pkg-plist</filename> mentioned in the previous
	  paragraph.</para>

      <para>If your port needs to build slightly different versions of
	packages by having a variable (for instance, resolution, or paper
	size) take different values, create one subdirectory per package to
	make it easier for users to see what to do, but try to share as many
	files as possible between ports.  Typically you only need a very short
	<filename>Makefile</filename> in all but one of the directories if you
	use variables cleverly.  In the sole <filename>Makefile</filename>,
	you can use <makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar> to specify the directory
	where the rest of the files are.  Also, use a variable as part of
	<link linkend="porting-pkgname"><makevar>PKGNAMESUFFIX</makevar></link> so
	the packages will have different names.</para>

      <para>This will be best demonstrated by an example.  This is part of
	<filename>japanese/xdvi300/Makefile</filename>;</para>

      <programlisting>PORTNAME=       xdvi
PORTVERSION=    17
PKGNAMEPREFIX=  ja-
PKGNAMESUFFIX=  ${RESOLUTION}
 :
# default
RESOLUTION?=   300
.if ${RESOLUTION} != 118 && ${RESOLUTION} != 240 && \
       ${RESOLUTION} != 300 && ${RESOLUTION} != 400
       @${ECHO} "Error: invalid value for RESOLUTION: \"${RESOLUTION}\""
       @${ECHO} "Possible values are: 118, 240, 300 (default) and 400."
       @${FALSE}
.endif</programlisting>

      <para><filename role="package">japanese/xdvi300</filename> also has all the regular
	patches, package files, etc.  If you type <command>make</command>
	there, it will take the default value for the resolution (300) and
	build the port normally.</para>

      <para>As for other resolutions, this is the <emphasis>entire</emphasis>
	<filename>xdvi118/Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>RESOLUTION=     118

.include "${MASTERDIR}/Makefile"</programlisting>

      <para>(<filename>xdvi240/Makefile</filename> and
	<filename>xdvi400/Makefile</filename> are similar).  The
	<makevar>MASTERDIR</makevar> definition tells
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> that the regular set of
	subdirectories like <makevar>FILESDIR</makevar> and
	<makevar>SCRIPTDIR</makevar> are to be found under
	<filename>xdvi300</filename>.  The <literal>RESOLUTION=118</literal>
	line will override the <literal>RESOLUTION=300</literal> line in
	<filename>xdvi300/Makefile</filename> and the port will be built with
	resolution set to 118.</para>

    <chapter id="shared">
      <title>Shared library versions</title>

      <para>Please read our <ulink url="../developers-handbook/policies-shlib.html">policy on
	shared library versioning</ulink> to understand what to do with
	shared library versions in general.  Do not blindly assume software
	authors know what they are doing; many of them do not.  It is very
	important that these details are carefully considered, as we have
	quite a unique situation where we are trying to have dozens of
	potentially incompatible software pairs co-exist. Careless port
	imports have caused great trouble regarding shared libraries in the
	past (ever wondered why the port <filename>jpeg-6b</filename> has a
	shared library version of 9?). If in doubt, send a message to the
	&a.ports;.  Most of the time, your job ends by determining the right
	shared library version and making appropriate patches to implement
	it.</para>

<!--
      <para>However, if there is a port which is a different version of the
	same software already in the tree, the situation is much more complex.
	In short, the FreeBSD implementation does not allow the user to
	specify to the linker which version of shared library to link against
	(the linker will always pick the highest numbered version).  This
	means, if there is a <filename>libfoo.so.3.2</filename> and
	<filename>libfoo.so.4.0</filename> in the system, there is no way to
	tell the linker to link a particular application to
	<filename>libfoo.so.3.2</filename>.  It is essentially completely
	overshadowed in terms of compilation-time linkage.  In this case, the
	only solution  is to rename the <emphasis>base</emphasis> part of the
	shared library.  For instance, change
	<filename>libfoo.so.4.0</filename> to
	<filename>libfoo4.so.1.0</filename> so both version 3.2 and 4.0 can be
	linked from other ports.</para>

    <chapter id="porting-manpages">
      <title>Manpages</title>

      <para>The <makevar>MAN[1-9LN]</makevar> variables will automatically add
	any manpages to <filename>pkg-plist</filename> (this means you must
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> list manpages in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>&mdash;see <link
	  linkend="porting-plist">generating PLIST</link> for more).  It also
	makes the install stage automatically compress or uncompress manpages
	depending on the setting of <makevar>NOMANCOMPRESS</makevar> in
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>If your port tries to install multiple names for manpages using
	symlinks or hardlinks, you must use the <makevar>MLINKS</makevar>
	variable to identify these.  The link installed by your port will
	be destroyed and recreated by <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>
	to make sure it points to the correct file.  Any manpages
	listed in MLINKS must not be listed in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>To specify whether the manpages are compressed upon installation,
	use the <makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar> variable. This variable can
	take three values, <literal>yes</literal>, <literal>no</literal> and
	<literal>maybe</literal>. <literal>yes</literal> means manpages are
	already installed compressed, <literal>no</literal> means they are
	not, and <literal>maybe</literal> means the software already respects
	the value of <makevar>NOMANCOMPRESS</makevar> so
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> does not have to do anything
	special.</para>

      <para><makevar>MANCOMPRESSED</makevar> is automatically set to
	<literal>yes</literal> if <makevar>USE_IMAKE</makevar> is set and
	<makevar>NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES</makevar> is not set, and to
	<literal>no</literal> otherwise.  You do not have to explicitly define
	it unless the default is not suitable for your port.</para>

      <para>If your port anchors its man tree somewhere other than
	<makevar>PREFIX</makevar>, you can use the
	<makevar>MANPREFIX</makevar> to set it.  Also, if only manpages in
	certain sections go in a non-standard place, such as some <literal>perl</literal> modules
	ports, you can set individual man paths using
	<makevar>MAN<replaceable>sect</replaceable>PREFIX</makevar> (where
	<replaceable>sect</replaceable> is one of <literal>1-9</literal>,
	<literal>L</literal> or <literal>N</literal>).</para>

      <para>If your manpages go to language-specific subdirectories, set the
	name of the languages to <makevar>MANLANG</makevar>.  The value of
	this variable defaults to <literal>""</literal> (i.e., English
	only).</para>

      <para>Here is an example that puts it all together.</para>

      <programlisting>MAN1=          foo.1
MAN3=          bar.3
MAN4=          baz.4
MLINKS=        foo.1 alt-name.8
MANLANG=       "" ja

${PREFIX}/man/ja/man4/baz.4.gz</programlisting>

      <para>Additionally <filename>${PREFIX}/man/man8/alt-name.8.gz</filename>

	  the full version number of <command>perl</command> (e.g.,

	  is the <command>perl</command> version number minus

PLIST_SUB=      OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

	  in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use

	<para>Avoiding the hard-coding of <filename>/usr/local</filename> or

	  <filename>/usr/X11R6</filename> for X ports that do not use imake)
	  in the various <filename>scripts/Makefile</filename>s in the port to read

	to do that while you have it installed would do that.</para>

	<para>Do not set <makevar>USE_X_PREFIX</makevar> unless your port

	<para>The variable <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> can be reassigned in your

	  However, it is strongly discouraged for individual ports to set this
	  variable explicitly in the <filename>Makefile</filename>s.</para>

	<para>Also, refer to programs/files from other ports with the
	  variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For instance, if
	  your port requires a macro <literal>PAGER</literal> to be the full
	  pathname of <command>less</command>, use the compiler flag:

	  <programlisting>-DPAGER=\"&dollar;{PREFIX}/bin/less\"</programlisting>

      <title>Upgrading</title>

      <para>When you notice that a port is out of date compared to the latest
	version from the original authors, first make sure you have the latest
	port.  You can find them in the
	<filename>ports/ports-current</filename> directory of the &os; FTP mirror
	sites.  You may also use <application>CVSup</application> to keep your whole ports collection
	up-to-date, as described in the <ulink url="../handbook/synching.html#CVSUP-CONFIG">Handbook</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The next step is to send an email to the maintainer, if one is
	listed in the port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  That person may
	already be working on an upgrade, or have a reason to not upgrade the
	port right now (because of, for example, stability problems of the new
	version); you would not want to duplicate their work.  Note that
	unmaintained ports are listed with a maintainer of
	<literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>; mail to that address
	probably will not help in this case.</para>

      <para>If the maintainer asks you to do the upgrade or the maintainer
	is <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>,
	please make the upgrade and save the result of the
	recursive <command>diff</command> output
	of the new and old
	ports directories (e.g., if your modified port directory is
	called <filename>superedit</filename> and the original is in our tree
	as <filename>superedit.bak</filename>, then save the result of
	<command>diff -ruN superedit.bak superedit</command>).  Either
	unified or context diff is fine, but port committers generally
	prefer unified diffs.  Note the use of the <literal>-N</literal>
	option&mdash;this is the accepted way to force diff to properly
	deal with the case of new files being added or old files being
	deleted.  Before sending us the diff, please examine the
	output to make sure all the changes make sense.</para>

      <para> The best way to
	send us the diff is by including it via &man.send-pr.1; (category
	<literal>ports</literal>).  If you are going to be the maintainer for the port,
	be sure to put <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> at the beginning
	of your synopsis line and/or set the <quote>Class</quote> of your PR
	to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  Please mention any added or
	deleted files in the message, as they have to be explicitly specified
	to CVS when doing a commit.  If the diff is more than about 20KB,
	please compress and uuencode it; otherwise, just include it in the PR
	as is.</para>

      <para>Finally, please see the
        <ulink url="../../articles/problem-reports/pr-writing.html">
        Writing the problem report</ulink> section in the Problem
        Reports article for more information about how to write
        useful problem reports.</para>

      <important>
	<para>If your upgrade is motivated by security concerns or a
	  serious fault in the currently committed port, please notify
	  the &a.portmgr; to request immediate rebuilding and
	  redistribution of your port's package.  Unsuspecting users
	  of &man.pkg.add.1; will otherwise continue to install the
	  old version via <command>pkg_add -r</command> for several
	  weeks.</para>
      </important>

      <note>
	<para>Once again, please use &man.diff.1; and not &man.shar.1; to send
	  updates to existing ports!</para>

      <para>Here is a list of common dos and don'ts that you encounter during

      <sect1 id="dads-strip">
	<title>Stripping Binaries</title>

	<para>Do not strip binaries manually unless you have to.  All binaries
	  should be stripped, but the <maketarget>INSTALL_PROGRAM</maketarget>
	  macro will install and strip a binary at the same time (see the next
	  section).</para>

	<para>If you need to strip a file, but do not wish to use the
	  <makevar>INSTALL_PROGRAM</makevar> macro,
	  <makevar>${STRIP_CMD}</makevar> will strip your program.  This is
	  typically done within the <literal>post-install</literal>
	  target.  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>post-install:
	${STRIP_CMD} ${PREFIX}/bin/xdl</programlisting>

	<para>Use the &man.file.1; command on the installed executable to
	  check whether the binary is stripped or not.  If it does not say
	  <literal>not stripped</literal>, it is stripped.  Additionally,
	  &man.strip.1; will not strip a previously stripped program; it
	  will instead exit cleanly.</para>

      <sect1 id="porting-wrkdir">
	<title><makevar>WRKDIR</makevar></title>

	<para>Do not write anything to files outside
	  <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar>.  <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar> is the only
	  place that is guaranteed to be writable during the port build (see
	  <ulink url="../handbook/ports-using.html#PORTS-CD">
	  installing ports from a CDROM</ulink> for an
	  example of building ports from a read-only tree).  If you need to

	  files, do so by <link
	  linkend="porting-pkgfiles">redefining a variable</link>, not by
	  writing over it.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="porting-wrkdirprefix">
	<title><makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar></title>

	<para>Make sure your port honors <makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar>.
	  Most ports do not have to worry about this.  In particular, if you
	  are referring to a <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar> of another port, note
	  that the correct location is
	  <filename><makevar>WRKDIRPREFIX</makevar><makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar>/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> not <filename><makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar>/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> or <filename><makevar>.CURDIR</makevar>/../../<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename> or some such.</para>

	<para>Also, if you are defining <makevar>WRKDIR</makevar> yourself,
	  make sure you prepend
	  <literal>&dollar;{WRKDIRPREFIX}&dollar;{.CURDIR}</literal> in the
	  front.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="porting-versions">
	<title>Differentiating operating systems and OS versions</title>

	<para>You may come across code that needs modifications or conditional
	  compilation based upon what version of Unix it is running under.  If
	  you need to make such changes to the code for conditional
	  compilation, make sure you make the changes as general as possible
	  so that we can back-port code to older FreeBSD systems and cross-port
	  to other BSD systems such as 4.4BSD from CSRG, BSD/386, 386BSD,
	  NetBSD, and OpenBSD.</para>

	<para>The preferred way to tell 4.3BSD/Reno (1990) and newer versions
	  of the BSD code apart is by using the <literal>BSD</literal> macro
	  defined in <filename>&lt;sys/param.h&gt;</filename>.  Hopefully that
	  file is already included; if not, add the code:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(__unix__) || defined(unix)) &amp;&amp; !defined(USG)
#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;
#endif</programlisting>

	<para>to the proper place in the <filename>.c</filename> file.  We
	  believe that every system that defines these two symbols has
	  <filename>sys/param.h</filename>.  If you find a system that
	  does not, we would like to know.  Please send mail to the
	  &a.ports;.</para>

	<para>Another way is to use the GNU Autoconf style of doing
	  this:</para>

	<programlisting>#ifdef HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;
#endif</programlisting>

	<para>Do not forget to add <literal>-DHAVE_SYS_PARAM_H</literal> to the
	  <makevar>CFLAGS</makevar> in the <filename>Makefile</filename> for
	  this method.</para>

	<para>Once you have <filename>sys/param.h</filename> included, you may
	  use:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199103))</programlisting>

	<para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.3 Net2 code base
	  or newer (e.g. FreeBSD 1.x, 4.3/Reno, NetBSD 0.9, 386BSD, BSD/386
	  1.1 and below).</para>

	<para>Use:</para>

	<programlisting>#if (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; (BSD &gt;= 199306))</programlisting>

	<para>to detect if the code is being compiled on a 4.4 code base or
	  newer (e.g. FreeBSD 2.x, 4.4, NetBSD 1.0, BSD/386 2.0 or
	  above).</para>

	<para>The value of the <literal>BSD</literal> macro is
	  <literal>199506</literal> for the 4.4BSD-Lite2 code base.  This is
	  stated for informational purposes only.  It should not be used to
	  distinguish between versions of FreeBSD based only on 4.4-Lite vs.
	  versions that have merged in changes from 4.4-Lite2.  The
	  <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> macro should be used instead.</para>

	<para>Use sparingly:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined in all versions of
	      FreeBSD.  Use it if the change you are making
	      <emphasis>only</emphasis> affects FreeBSD.  Porting gotchas like
	      the use of <literal>sys_errlist[]</literal> vs
	      <function>strerror()</function> are Berkeley-isms, not FreeBSD
	      changes.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>In FreeBSD 2.x, <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined to
	      be <literal>2</literal>.  In earlier versions, it is
	      <literal>1</literal>.  Later versions always bump it to match
	      their major version number.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you need to tell the difference between a FreeBSD 1.x
	      system and a FreeBSD 2.x or above system, usually the right answer
	      is to use the <literal>BSD</literal> macros described above.  If
	      there actually is a FreeBSD specific change (such as special
	      shared library options when using <command>ld</command>) then it
	      is OK to use <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> and <literal>#if
		__FreeBSD__ &gt; 1</literal> to detect a FreeBSD 2.x and later
	      system.  If you need more granularity in detecting FreeBSD
	      systems since 2.0-RELEASE you can use the following:</para>

	    <programlisting>#if __FreeBSD__ &gt;= 2
#include &lt;osreldate.h&gt;
#    if __FreeBSD_version &gt;= 199504
	 /* 2.0.5+ release specific code here */
#    endif
#endif</programlisting>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>In the hundreds of ports that have been done, there have only
	  been one or two cases where <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> should
	  have been used.  Just because an earlier port screwed up and used it
	  in the wrong place does not mean you should do so too.</para>

	  <para>Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as
	    <quote>2.2.5-STABLE</quote> after the 2.2.5-RELEASE.  The pattern
	    used to be year followed by the month, but we decided to change it
	    to a more straightforward major/minor system starting from 2.2.
	    This is because the parallel development on several branches made
	    it infeasible to classify the releases simply by their real
	    release dates.  If you are making a port now, you do not have to
	    worry about old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for your

      <sect1 id="dads-documentation">

	<para>If your software has some documentation other than the standard
	  man and info pages that you think is useful for the user, install it
	  under <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/doc</filename>.
	  This can be done, like the previous item, in the
	  <maketarget>post-install</maketarget> target.</para>

	<para>Create a new directory for your port.  The directory name should
	  reflect what the port is.  This usually means
	  <makevar>PORTNAME</makevar>. However, if you
	  think the user might want different versions of the port to be
	  installed at the same time, you can use the whole
	  <makevar>PKGNAME</makevar>.</para>

	<para>Make the installation dependent to the variable
	  <makevar>NOPORTDOCS</makevar> so that users can disable it in

	${INSTALL_MAN} ${WRKSRC}/docs/xvdocs.ps ${DOCSDIR}

	    <para><literal>${DATADIR}</literal> gets expanded to

	<programlisting>%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/AUTHORS
%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT
%%PORTDOCS%%@dirrm %%DOCSDIR%%</programlisting>

	<para>You can also use the <filename>pkg-message</filename> file to

      <sect1 id="dads-subdirs">
	<title>Subdirectories</title>

	<para>Try to let the port put things in the right subdirectories of
	  <makevar>PREFIX</makevar>.  Some ports lump everything and put it in
	  the subdirectory with the port's name, which is incorrect.  Also,
	  many ports put everything except binaries, header files and manual
	  pages in the a subdirectory of <filename>lib</filename>, which does
	  not work well with the BSD paradigm.  Many of the files should be
	  moved to one of the following: <filename>etc</filename>
	  (setup/configuration files), <filename>libexec</filename>
	  (executables started internally), <filename>sbin</filename>
	  (executables for superusers/managers), <filename>info</filename>
	  (documentation for info browser) or  <filename>share</filename>
	  (architecture independent files).  See &man.hier.7; for details;
	  the rules governing
	  <filename>/usr</filename> pretty much apply to
	  <filename>/usr/local</filename> too.  The exception are ports
	  dealing with USENET <quote>news</quote>.  They may use
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/news</filename> as a destination
	  for their files.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="porting-cleaning">
	<title>Cleaning up empty directories</title>

	<para>Do make your ports clean up after themselves when they are
	  de-installed.  This is usually accomplished by adding
	  <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines for all directories that are
	  specifically created by the port.  You need to delete subdirectories
	  before you can delete parent directories.</para>

	<programlisting> :
lib/X11/oneko/pixmaps/cat.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/sounds/cat.au
 :
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko/pixmaps
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko/sounds
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	<para>However, sometimes <literal>@dirrm</literal> will give you
	  errors because other ports also share the same subdirectory.  You
	  can call <command>rmdir</command> from <literal>@unexec</literal> to
	  remove only empty directories without warning.</para>

	<programlisting>@unexec rmdir %D/share/doc/gimp 2>/dev/null || true</programlisting>

	<para>This will neither print any error messages nor cause
	  &man.pkg.delete.1; to exit abnormally even if
	  <filename><makevar>PREFIX</makevar>/share/doc/gimp</filename> is not
	  empty due to other ports installing some files in there.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="dads-uid">
	<title>UIDs</title>

	<para>If your port requires a certain user to be on the installed
	  system, let the <filename>pkg-install</filename> script call
	  <command>pw</command> to create it automatically.  Look at
	  <filename role="package">net/cvsup-mirror</filename> for an example.</para>

	<para>If your port must use the same user/group ID number when it is
	  installed as a binary package as when it was compiled, then you must
	  choose a free UID from 50 to 999 and register it below.  Look at
	  <filename role="package">japanese/Wnn6</filename> for an example.</para>

	<para>Make sure you do not use a UID already used by the system or
	  other ports.  This is the current list of UIDs between 50 and
	  999.</para>

	      number of vulnerable FreeBSD hosts (we like being known
	      for being secure), however sometimes there is a
	      noticeable time gap between disclosure of a
	      vulnerability and an updated release of the
	      vulnerable software.  Do not mark a port

      <title>Automated package list creation</title>

      <para>First, make sure your port is almost complete, with only
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> missing.</para>

      <para>Next, create a temporary directory tree into which your port can be
	installed, and install any dependencies.
	<replaceable>port-type</replaceable> should be <literal>local</literal>
	for non-X ports and <literal>x11-4</literal> or <literal>x11</literal>
	for ports which install into the directory hierarchy of XFree86 4
	or an earlier XFree86 release, respectively.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mtree -U -f /etc/mtree/BSD.<replaceable>port-type</replaceable>.dist -d -e -p /var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make depends PREFIX=/var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Store the directory structure in a new file.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable> && find -d * -type d) | sort &gt; OLD-DIRS</userinput></screen>

      <para>Create an empty <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>touch pkg-plist</userinput></screen>

      <para>If your port honors <makevar>PREFIX</makevar> (which it should)
	you can then install the port and create the package list.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install PREFIX=/var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable> && find -d * \! -type d) | sort &gt; pkg-plist</userinput></screen>

      <para>You must also add any newly created directories to the packing
	list.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>(cd /var/tmp/<replaceable>port-name</replaceable> && find -d * -type d) | sort | comm -13 OLD-DIRS - | sort -r | sed -e 's#^#@dirrm #' &gt;&gt; pkg-plist</userinput></screen>

      <para>Finally, you need to tidy up the packing list by hand; it is not
	<emphasis>all</emphasis> automated.  Manual pages should be listed in
	the port's <filename>Makefile</filename> under
	<makevar>MAN<replaceable>n</replaceable></makevar>, and not in the
	package list.  User configuration files should be removed, or
	installed as
	<filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>.
	The <filename>info/dir</filename> file should not be listed
	and appropriate <filename>install-info</filename> lines should
	be added as noted in the <link linkend="porting-info">info
	files</link> section.  Any
	libraries installed by the port should be listed as specified in the
	<link linkend="porting-shlibs">shared libraries</link> section.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, use the <command>plist</command> script in
	<filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/</filename> to build the
	package list automatically.</para>

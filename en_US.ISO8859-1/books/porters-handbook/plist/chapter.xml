  <sect1 xml:id="plist-sub">
    <title>Changing <filename>pkg-plist</filename> Based on Make
      Variables</title>

    <para>Some ports, particularly the <literal>p5-</literal> ports,
      need to change their <filename>pkg-plist</filename> depending on
      what options they are configured with (or version of
      <literal>perl</literal>, in the case of <literal>p5-</literal>
      ports).  To make this easy, any instances in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>,
      <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>, and
      <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> will be substituted
      appropriately.  The value of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal> is the
      numeric revision of the operating system (for example,
      <literal>4.9</literal>).  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal>
      and <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal> is the full version number
      of <command>perl</command> (for example, <literal>5.8.9</literal>).
      Several other
      <literal>%%<replaceable>VARS</replaceable>%%</literal> related
      to port's documentation files are described in <link
	linkend="install-documentation">the relevant
	section</link>.</para>

    <para>To make other substitutions, set
      <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname> with a list of
      <literal><replaceable>VAR</replaceable>=<replaceable>VALUE</replaceable></literal>
      pairs and instances of
      <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal> will be
      substituted with <replaceable>VALUE</replaceable> in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <para>For instance, if a port installs many files
      in a version-specific subdirectory, use a placeholder for the
      version so that <filename>pkg-plist</filename> does not have to
      be regenerated every time the port is updated.  For
      example:</para>

    <programlisting>OCTAVE_VERSION=	${PORTREVISION}
PLIST_SUB=	OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

    <para>in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use
      <literal>%%OCTAVE_VERSION%%</literal> wherever the version shows
      up in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  When
      the port is upgraded, it will not be necessary to edit dozens (or in some
      cases, hundreds) of lines in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <para>If files are installed conditionally on the options
      set in the port, the usual way of handling it is prefixing
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> lines with a
      <literal>%%OPT%%</literal> for lines needed when the option is
      enabled, or <literal>%%NO_OPT%%</literal> when the option is
      disabled, and adding <literal>OPTIONS_SUB=yes</literal> to the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  See <xref
	linkend="options_sub"/> for more information.</para>

    <para>For instance, if there are files that are only installed
      when the <literal>X11</literal> option is enabled, and
      <filename>Makefile</filename> has:</para>

    <programlisting>OPTIONS_DEFINE=	X11
OPTIONS_SUB=	yes</programlisting>

    <para>In <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, put
      <literal>%%X11%%</literal> in front of the lines only being
      installed when the option is enabled, like this :</para>

    <programlisting>%%X11%%bin/foo-gui</programlisting>

    <para>This substitution will be done between the
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> and
      <buildtarget>do-install</buildtarget> targets, by reading from
      <filename>PLIST</filename> and writing to
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> (default:
      <filename>WRKDIR/.PLIST.mktmp</filename>).  So if the port
      builds <filename>PLIST</filename> on the fly, do so in or before
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget>.  Also, if the port
      needs to edit the resulting file, do so in
      <buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> to a file named
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename>.</para>

    <para>Another way of modifying a port's packing list is based on
      setting the variables <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>.  The value of each variable is
      regarded as a list of pathnames to write to
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> along with
      <filename>PLIST</filename> contents.  Names listed in
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> are subject to
      <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal>
      substitution as described above.  Except for that, names from
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> will appear in the final packing
      list unchanged, while <literal>@dir</literal>
      will be prepended to names from
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>.  To take effect,
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> must be set before
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> is written, that is, in
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> or earlier.</para>

    <para>From time to time, using <varname>OPTIONS_SUB</varname>
      is not enough.  In those cases, adding a specific
      <literal><replaceable>TAG</replaceable></literal> to <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname>
      inside the <filename>Makefile</filename> with a special
      value of <literal>@comment</literal>, makes package tools to
      ignore the line.  For instance, if some files are only installed
      when the <literal>X11</literal> option is on and the
      architecture is <literal>i386</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>.include &lt;bsd.port.pre.mk&gt;

.if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MX11} &amp;&amp; ${ARCH} == "i386"
PLIST_SUB+=	X11I386=""
.else
PLIST_SUB+=	X11I386="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

    <sect2 xml:id="plist-dir-cleaning">
      <title>Cleaning Up Empty Directories</title>

      <para>When being de-installed, a port has to remove empty
	directories it created.  Most of these directories are removed
	automatically by &man.pkg.8;, but for directories created
	outside of <filename>${PREFIX}</filename>, or empty
	directories, some more work needs to be done.  This is usually
	accomplished by adding <literal>@dir</literal> lines for those
	directories.  Subdirectories must be deleted before deleting
	parent directories.</para>

      <programlisting>[...]
@dir /var/games/oneko/saved-games

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="plist-dir-empty">
      <title>Creating Empty Directories</title>

      <para>Empty directories created during port installation need
	special attention.  They must be present when the package
	is created.   If they are not created by the port code, create
	them in the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>post-stage:
	@${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/some/directory</programlisting>

      <para>Add the directory to <filename>pkg-plist</filename>

  <sect1 xml:id="plist-config">
    <title>Configuration Files</title>

    <para>If the port installs configuration files to
      <filename>PREFIX/etc</filename> (or elsewhere) do
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> list them in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That will cause
      <command>pkg delete</command> to remove files that have been carefully
      edited by the user, and a re-installation will wipe them
      out.</para>

    <para>Instead, install sample files with a
      <filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>
      extension. The <literal>@sample</literal> macro automates this,
      see <xref linkend="plist-keywords-sample"/> for what it does
      exactly.  For each sample file, add a line to
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>@sample etc/orbit.conf.sample</programlisting>

    <para>If there is a very good reason not to install a working
      configuration file by default, only list the sample filename in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, without the
      <literal>@sample</literal> followed by a space part, and add a
      <link
	linkend="porting-message">message</link> pointing out that the
      user must copy and edit the file before the software will
      work.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>When a port installs its configuration in a subdirectory
	of <filename>${PREFIX}/etc</filename>, use
	<varname>ETCDIR</varname>, which defaults to
	<literal>${PREFIX}/etc/${PORTNAME}</literal>, it can be
	overridden in the ports <filename>Makefile</filename> if there
	is a convention for the port to use some other directory.  The
	<literal>%%ETCDIR%%</literal> macro will be used in its
	stead in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>
    </tip>

    <note>
      <para>The sample configuration files should always have the
	<filename>.sample</filename> suffix.  If for some historical
	reason using the standard suffix is not possible, use
	this construct:</para>

      <programlisting>@unexec if cmp -s %D/etc/orbit.conf-dist %D/etc/orbit.conf; then rm -f %D/etc/orbit.conf; fi
etc/orbit.conf-dist
@exec if [ ! -f %D/etc/orbit.conf ] ; then cp -p %D/%F %B/orbit.conf; fi</programlisting>

      <para>The order of these lines is important.  On deinstallation,
	the sample file is compared to the actual configuration file.
	If these files are identical, no changes have been made by the
	user and the actual file can be safely deleted.  Because the
	sample file must still exist for the comparison, the
	<literal>@unexec</literal> line comes before the sample
	configuration file name.  On installation, if an actual
	configuration file is not already present, the sample file is
	copied to the actual file.  The sample file must be present
	before it can be copied, so the <literal>@exec</literal> line
	comes after the sample configuration file name.</para>

      <para>To debug any issues, temporarily remove the
	<literal>-s</literal> flag to &man.cmp.1; for more
	output.</para>

      <para>See &man.pkg-create.8; for more information on
	<literal>%D</literal> and related substitution markers.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="plist-dynamic">
    <title>Dynamic Versus Static Package List</title>

    <para>A <emphasis>static package list</emphasis> is a package
      list which is available in the Ports Collection either as
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> (with or without variable
      substitution), or embedded into the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> via
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>.  Even if the contents are
      auto-generated by a tool or a target in the Makefile
      <emphasis>before</emphasis> the inclusion into the Ports
      Collection by a committer (for example, using <command>make
	makeplist></command>), this is still considered a static list,
      since it is possible to examine it without having to download or
      compile the distfile.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis>dynamic package list</emphasis> is a package
      list which is generated at the time the port is compiled based
      upon the files and directories which are installed.  It is not
      possible to examine it before the source code of the ported
      application is downloaded and compiled, or after running a
      <literal>make clean</literal>.</para>

    <para>While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden,
      maintainers should use static package lists wherever possible,
      as it enables users to &man.grep.1; through available ports to
      discover, for example, which port installs a certain file.
      Dynamic lists should be primarily used for complex ports where
      the package list changes drastically based upon optional
      features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package list
      is infeasible), or ports which change the package list based
      upon the version of dependent software used.  For example, ports which
      generate docs with <application>Javadoc</application>.</para>

	  the directory needs to have non default owner, group, or
	  mode.  Directories outside of <varname>PREFIX</varname> need
	  to be registered.  For example,
	  <filename>/var/db/${PORTNAME}</filename> needs to have a
	  <literal>@dir</literal> entry whereas
	  <filename>${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}</filename> does not if
	  it contains files or uses the default owner, group, and

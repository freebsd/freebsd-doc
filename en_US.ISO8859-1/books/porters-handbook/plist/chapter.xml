    <title>Changing <filename>pkg-plist</filename> Based on Make
      Variables</title>

    <para>Some ports, particularly the <literal>p5-</literal> ports,
      need to change their <filename>pkg-plist</filename> depending on
      what options they are configured with (or version of
      <literal>perl</literal>, in the case of <literal>p5-</literal>
      ports).  To make this easy, any instances in the
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>,
      <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>, and
      <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> will be substituted for
      appropriately.  The value of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal> is the
      numeric revision of the operating system (e.g.,
      <literal>4.9</literal>).  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal>
      and <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal> is the full version number
      of <command>perl</command> (e.g., <literal>5.8.9</literal>).
      Several other <literal>%%<replaceable>VARS</replaceable>%%</literal> related to port's
      documentation files are described in
      <link linkend="install-documentation">the relevant
	section</link>.</para>

    <para>If you need to make other substitutions, you can set the
      <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname> variable with a list of
      <literal><replaceable>VAR</replaceable>=<replaceable>VALUE</replaceable></literal> pairs and instances of
      <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal> will be substituted with
      <replaceable>VALUE</replaceable> in the
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <para>For instance, if you have a port that installs many files
      in a version-specific subdirectory, you can put something
      like</para>

    <programlisting>OCTAVE_VERSION=	2.0.13
PLIST_SUB=	OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

    <para>in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use
      <literal>%%OCTAVE_VERSION%%</literal> wherever the version shows
      up in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That way, when you
      upgrade the port, you will not have to change dozens (or in some
      cases, hundreds) of lines in the
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <para>If your port installs files conditionally on the options
      set in the port, the usual way of handling it is prefixing the
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> lines with a
      <literal>%%OPT%%</literal> for lines needed when the option is
      enabled, or <literal>%%NO_OPT%%</literal> when the option is
      disabled, and adding <literal>OPTIONS_SUB=yes</literal> to the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  See <xref
	linkend="options_sub"/> for more information.</para>

    <para>For instance, if there are files that are only installed
      when the <literal>X11</literal> option is enabled, and the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> has:</para>

    <programlisting>OPTIONS_DEFINE=	X11
OPTIONS_SUB=	yes</programlisting>

    <para>In the <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file, put
      <literal>%%X11%%</literal> in front of the lines only being
      installed when the option is enabled, like this :</para>

    <programlisting>%%X11%%bin/foo-gui</programlisting>

    <para>This substitution will be done between the
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> and
      <buildtarget>do-install</buildtarget> targets, by reading from
      <filename>PLIST</filename> and writing to
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> (default:
      <filename>WRKDIR/.PLIST.mktmp</filename>).  So if your port
      builds <filename>PLIST</filename> on the fly, do so in or before
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget>.  Also, if your port
      needs to edit the resulting file, do so in
      <buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> to a file named
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename>.</para>

    <para>Another way of modifying a port's packing list is based on
      setting the variables <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>,
      <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>, and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname>.  The value of each variable is
      regarded as a list of pathnames to write to
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> along with
      <filename>PLIST</filename> contents.  Names listed in
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>, <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>,
      and <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> are subject to
      <literal>%%<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>%%</literal> substitution as described above.
      Except for that, names from <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> will
      appear in the final packing list unchanged, while
      <literal>@dirrm</literal> and <literal>@dirrmtry</literal> will
      be prepended to names from <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> and
      <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname>, respectively.  To take effect,
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>, <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>,
      and <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> must be set before
      <filename>TMPPLIST</filename> is written, i.e., in
      <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> or earlier.</para>

    <para>From time to time, the <varname>OPTIONS_SUB</varname>
      construct is not enough, in those cases, adding a specific
      <literal>TAG</literal> to the <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname>
      variable inside the <filename>Makefile</filename> with a special
      value of <literal>@comment</literal>, makes package tools to
      ignore the line.  For instance, if some files are only installed
      when the <literal>X11</literal> option is on and the
      architecture is <literal>i386</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>.include &lt;bsd.port.pre.mk&gt;

.if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MX11} &amp;&amp; ${ARCH} == "i386"
PLIST_SUB+=	X11I386=""
.else
PLIST_SUB+=	X11I386="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

    <title>Empty Directories</title>

    <sect2 xml:id="plist-dir-cleaning">
      <title>Cleaning Up Empty Directories</title>

      <para>When being de-installed, A port has to remove empty
	directories it created.  This is usually accomplished by
	adding <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines for all directories
	that are specifically created by the port.  You need to delete
	subdirectories before you can delete parent
	directories.</para>

      <programlisting> :
lib/X11/oneko/pixmaps/cat.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/sounds/cat.au
 :
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko/pixmaps
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko/sounds
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

      <para>However, sometimes <literal>@dirrm</literal> will give
	you errors because other ports share the same directory.  You
	can use <literal>@dirrmtry</literal> to remove only empty
	directories without warning.</para>

      <programlisting>@dirrmtry share/doc/gimp</programlisting>

      <para>This will neither print any error messages nor cause
	<command>pkg delete</command> (see &man.pkg-delete.8;) to
	exit abnormally even if
	<filename>${PREFIX}/share/doc/gimp</filename> is not empty
	due to other ports installing some files in there.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="plist-dir-empty">
      <title>Creating Empty Directories</title>

      <para>Empty directories created during port installation need
	special attention.  They will not get created when installing
	the package, because packages only store the files, and both
	<command>pkg add</command> and <command>pkg install</command>
	creates directories for them as needed.  To make sure the
	empty directory is created when installing the package, add
	this line to <filename>pkg-plist</filename> above the
	corresponding <literal>@dirrm</literal> line:</para>

	<programlisting>@exec mkdir -p %D/share/foo/templates</programlisting>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="plist-config">
    <title>Configuration Files</title>

    <para>If your port installs configuration files to
      <filename>PREFIX/etc</filename> (or elsewhere) do
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> simply list them in the
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That will cause
      <command>pkg delete</command> to remove the files carefully
      edited by the user, and a re-installation will wipe them
      out.</para>

    <para>Instead, install sample file(s) as
      <filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable>.sample</filename>,
      and for each sample file, add this line to your
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <programlisting>@sample etc/orbit.conf.sample</programlisting>

    <para>If there is a very good reason not to install a working
      configuration file by default, only list the sample filename in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, without the <literal>@sample
	</literal> part, and add a <link
	linkend="porting-message">message</link> pointing out that the
      user must copy and edit the file before the software will
      work.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>When a port installs its configuration in a subdirectory
	of <filename>${PREFIX}/etc</filename>, it should be in
	<varname>ETCDIR</varname>, which defaults to
	<literal>${PREFIX}/etc/${PORTNAME}</literal>, it can be
	overrided in the ports <filename>Makefile</filename> if there
	is a convention for the port to use some other directory.  The
	<literal>%%ETCDIR%%</literal> macro should be used in its
	stead in the <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file.</para>
    </tip>

    <note>
      <para>The sample configuration files should always have the
	<filename>.sample</filename> suffix.  If for some historical
	reason you cannot use the standard suffix, you can still use
	this construct:</para>

      <programlisting>@unexec if cmp -s %D/etc/orbit.conf-dist %D/etc/orbit.conf; then rm -f %D/etc/orbit.conf; fi
etc/orbit.conf-dist
@exec if [ ! -f %D/etc/orbit.conf ] ; then cp -p %D/%F %B/orbit.conf; fi</programlisting>

      <para>The order of these lines is important.  On deinstallation,
	the sample file is compared to the actual configuration file.
	If these files are identical, no changes have been made by the
	user and the actual file can be safely deleted.  Because the
	sample file must still exist for the comparison, the
	<literal>@unexec</literal> line comes before the sample
	configuration file name.  On installation, if an actual
	configuration file is not already present, the sample file is
	copied to the actual file.  The sample file must be present
	before it can be copied, so the <literal>@exec</literal> line
	comes after the sample configuration file name.</para>

      <para>To debug any issues, temporarily remove the
	<literal>-s</literal> flag to &man.cmp.1; for more
	output.</para>

      <para>See &man.pkg-create.8; for more information on
	<literal>%D</literal> and related substitution markers.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="plist-dynamic">
    <title>Dynamic Versus Static Package List</title>

    <para>A <emphasis>static package list</emphasis> is a package
      list which is available in the Ports Collection either as a
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> file (with or without variable
      substitution), or embedded into the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> via
      <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>, <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>,
      and <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname>.  Even if the contents are
      auto-generated by a tool or a target in the Makefile
      <emphasis>before</emphasis> the inclusion into the Ports
      Collection by a committer (e.g., using <command>make
	makeplist></command>), this is still considered a static list,
      since it is possible to examine it without having to download or
      compile the distfile.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis>dynamic package list</emphasis> is a package
      list which is generated at the time the port is compiled based
      upon the files and directories which are installed.  It is not
      possible to examine it before the source code of the ported
      application is downloaded and compiled, or after running a
      <literal>make clean</literal>.</para>

    <para>While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden,
      maintainers should use static package lists wherever possible,
      as it enables users to &man.grep.1; through available ports to
      discover, for example, which port installs a certain file.
      Dynamic lists should be primarily used for complex ports where
      the package list changes drastically based upon optional
      features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package list
      is infeasible), or ports which change the package list based
      upon the version of dependent software used (e.g., ports which
      generate docs with <application>Javadoc</application>).</para>

    <para>First, make sure the port is almost complete, with only

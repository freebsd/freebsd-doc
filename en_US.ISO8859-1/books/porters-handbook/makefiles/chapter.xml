  <title>Configuring the Makefile</title>

  <para>Configuring the <filename>Makefile</filename> is pretty
    simple, and again we suggest looking at existing examples
    before starting.  Also, there is a
    <link linkend="porting-samplem">sample Makefile</link> in this
    handbook, so take a look and please follow the ordering of
    variables and sections in that template to make the port easier
    for others to read.</para>

  <para>Consider these problems in sequence during the
    design of the new <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="makefile-source">
    <title>The Original Source</title>

    <para>Does it live in <varname>DISTDIR</varname> as a standard
      <command>gzip</command>ped tarball named something like
      <filename>foozolix-1.2.tar.gz</filename>? If so, go on
      to the next step.  If not, the distribution file format might
      require overriding one or more of
      <varname>DISTVERSION</varname>, <varname>DISTNAME</varname>,
      <varname>EXTRACT_CMD</varname>,
      <varname>EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS</varname>,
      <varname>EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS</varname>,
      <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>, or
      <varname>DISTFILES</varname>.</para>

    <para>In the worst case, create a custom
      <buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget> target to override the
      default.  This is rarely, if ever, necessary.</para>

    <title>Naming</title>

    <para>The first part of the port's <filename>Makefile</filename>

      <sect3 xml:id="makefile-portrevision">
	<title><varname>PORTREVISION</varname></title>

	<para><varname>PORTREVISION</varname> is a
	  monotonically increasing value which is reset to 0 with
	  every increase of <varname>PORTVERSION</varname>, typically
	  every time there is a new official vendor release.  If
	  <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> is non-zero, the value is
	  appended to the package name.  Changes to
	  <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> are used by automated tools
	  like &man.pkg-version.8; to determine that a new package is
	  available.</para>

	<para><varname>PORTREVISION</varname> must be increased each
	  time a change is made to the port that changes the generated
	  package in any way.  That includes changes that only affect
	  a package built with non-default
	  <link linkend="makefile-options">options</link>.</para>

	<para>Examples of when <varname>PORTREVISION</varname>
	  must be bumped:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Addition of patches to correct security
	      vulnerabilities, bugs, or to add new functionality to
	      the port.</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Changes in the packing list or the install-time

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Silent changes to the port distfile which have

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Build fixes which cause a package to become

	      the changes do not introduce any functional change on
	      any other platforms on which the port did previously
	      build.  Since <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> reflects
	      the content of the package, if the package was not
	      previously buildable then there is no need to increase
	      <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> to mark a change.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>A rule of thumb is to decide whether a change
	  committed to a port is something which
	  <emphasis>some</emphasis> people would benefit from having.
	  Either because of an enhancement, fix,
	  or by virtue that the new package will actually work at
	  all.  Then weigh that against that fact that it will cause
	  everyone who regularly updates their ports tree to be
	  compelled to update.  If yes,
	  <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> must be bumped.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>People using binary packages will
	    <emphasis>never</emphasis> see the update if
	    <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> is not bumped.  Without
	    increasing <varname>PORTREVISION</varname>, the
	    package builders have no way to detect the change and
	    thus, will not rebuild the package.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="makefile-portepoch">
	<title><varname>PORTEPOCH</varname></title>

	<para>From time to time a software vendor or &os; porter will
	  do something silly and release a version of their software
	  which is actually numerically less than the previous
	  version.  An example of this is a port which goes from
	  foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be incorrectly
	  treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a numerically
	  greater value than 1).</para>

	<tip>
	  <para>The results of version number comparisons are not
	    always obvious.  <command>pkg version</command> (see
	    &man.pkg-version.8;) can be used to test the comparison of
	    two version number strings.  For example:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>pkg version -t 0.031 0.29</userinput>
	    &gt;</screen>

	  <para>The <literal>&gt;</literal> output indicates that
	    version 0.031 is considered greater than version 0.29,
	    which may not have been obvious to the porter.</para>
	</tip>

	<para>In situations such as this,
	  <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> must be increased.
	  If <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> is nonzero it is appended to
	  the package name as described in section 0 above.
	  <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> must never be decreased or
	  reset to zero, because that would cause comparison to a
	  package from an earlier epoch to fail.  For example, the
	  package would not be detected as out of date.  The new
	  version number, <literal>1.0,1</literal> in the above
	  example, is still numerically less than the previous
	  version, 20000801, but the <literal>,1</literal> suffix is
	  treated specially by automated tools and found to be greater
	  than the implied suffix <literal>,0</literal> on the earlier
	  package.</para>

	<para>Dropping or resetting <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname>
	  incorrectly leads to no end of grief.  If the discussion
	  above was not clear enough, please consult the
	  &a.ports;.</para>

	<para>It is expected that <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> will
	  not be used for the majority of ports, and that sensible use
	  of <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> can often preempt it
	  becoming necessary if a future release of the software
	  changes the version structure.  However, care is
	  needed by &os; porters when a vendor release is made without
	  an official version number &mdash; such as a code
	  <quote>snapshot</quote> release.  The temptation is to label
	  the release with the release date, which will cause problems
	  as in the example above when a new <quote>official</quote>
	  release is made.</para>

	<para>For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date
	  <literal>20000917</literal>, and the previous version of the
	  software was version <literal>1.2</literal>, do not use
	  <literal>20000917</literal> for
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname>.  The correct way is a
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> of
	  <literal>1.2.20000917</literal>, or similar, so that the
	  succeeding release, say <literal>1.3</literal>, is still a
	  numerically greater value.</para>

	      them (for example, <literal>1.0b2</literal>).</para>

	    <para>The idea is to make it easier to sort ports by

	      format.  It is important to prefix the version with

      <title>Choosing the Right Category</title>

      <para>As many of the categories overlap, choosing which of the
	categories will be the primary category of the port can be
	tedious.  There are several rules that govern this issue.
	Here is the list of priorities, in decreasing order of
	precedence:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The first category must be a physical category (see
	    <link linkend="porting-categories">above</link>).  This is
	    necessary to make the packaging work.  Virtual categories
	    and physical categories may be intermixed after
	    that.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Language specific categories always come first.  For
	    example, if the port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then
	    the <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> line would read
	    <filename>japanese x11-fonts</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Specific categories are listed before less-specific
	    ones.  For instance, an HTML editor is listed as
	    <filename>www editors</filename>, not the other way
	    around.  Also, do not list
	    <filename>net</filename> when the port belongs to any of
	    <filename>irc</filename>, <filename>mail</filename>,
	    <filename>news</filename>, <filename>security</filename>,
	    or <filename>www</filename>, as <filename>net</filename>
	    is included implicitly.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><filename>x11</filename> is used as a secondary
	    category only when the primary category is a natural
	    language.  In particular, do not put
	    <filename>x11</filename> in the category line for X
	    applications.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><application>Emacs</application> modes are
	    placed in the same ports category as the application
	    supported by the mode, not in
	    <filename>editors</filename>.  For example, an
	    <application>Emacs</application> mode to edit source files
	    of some programming language goes into
	    <filename>lang</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Ports installing loadable kernel modules also
	    have the virtual category <filename>kld</filename> in
	    their <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> line.  This is one of
	    the things handled automatically by adding
	    <literal>USES=kmod</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><filename>misc</filename> does not appear with any
	    other non-virtual category.  If there is
	    <literal>misc</literal> with something else in
	    <varname>CATEGORIES</varname>, that means
	    <literal>misc</literal> can safely be deleted and the port
	    placed only in the other subdirectory.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the port truly does not belong anywhere else,
	    put it in <filename>misc</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If the category is not clearly defined, please put a
	comment to that effect in the <link
	  xlink:href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/submit/">port
	  submission</link> in the bug database so
	we can discuss it before we import it.  As a committer,
	send a note to the &a.ports; so we can discuss it
	first.  Too often, new ports are imported to the wrong
	category only to be moved right away.  This causes unnecessary
	and undesirable bloat in the master source repository.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proposing-categories">
      <title>Proposing a New Category</title>

      <para>As the Ports Collection has grown over time, various new
	categories have been introduced.  New categories can either be
	<emphasis>virtual</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that do
	not have a corresponding subdirectory in the ports tree&mdash;
	or <emphasis>physical</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that
	do.  This section discusses the issues involved in creating a
	new physical category.  Read it thouroughly before proposing a
	new one.</para>

      <para>Our existing practice has been to avoid creating a new
	physical category unless either a large number of ports would
	logically belong to it, or the ports that would belong to it
	are a logically distinct group that is of limited general
	interest (for instance, categories related to spoken human
	languages), or preferably both.</para>

      <para>The rationale for this is that such a change creates a
	<link xlink:href="&url.articles.committers-guide;/#ports">fair
	  amount of work</link> for both the committers and also for
	all users who track changes to the Ports Collection.  In
	addition, proposed category changes just naturally seem to
	attract controversy.  (Perhaps this is because there is no
	clear consensus on when a category is <quote>too big</quote>,
	nor whether categories should lend themselves to browsing (and
	thus what number of categories would be an ideal number), and
	so forth.)</para>

      <para>Here is the procedure:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Propose the new category on &a.ports;.  Include
	    a detailed rationale for the new category,
	    including why the existing categories are not
	    sufficient, and the list of existing ports proposed to
	    move.  (If there are new ports pending in
	    <application>Bugzilla</application> that would fit this
	    category, list them too.)  If you are the maintainer
	    and/or submitter, respectively, mention that as it may
	    help the case.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Participate in the discussion.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>If it seems that there is support for the idea, file
	    a PR which includes both the rationale and the list of
	    existing ports that need to be moved.  Ideally, this PR
	    would also include these patches:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for the new ports
		once they are repocopied</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the new
		category</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the old ports'
		categories</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for ports that
		depend on the old ports</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>(for extra credit, include the other files
		that have to change, as per the procedure in the
		Committer's Guide.)</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Since it affects the ports infrastructure and involves
	    moving and patching many ports but also possibly running
	    regression tests on the build cluster, assign the PR to
	    the &a.portmgr;.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>If that PR is approved, a committer will need to
	    follow the rest of the procedure that is <link
	      xlink:href="&url.articles.committers-guide;/article.html#PORTS">outlined
	      in the Committer's Guide</link>.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>

      <para>Proposing a new virtual category is similar to the
	above but much less involved, since no ports will actually
	have to move.  In this case, the only patches to include in
	the PR would be those to add the new category to
	<varname>CATEGORIES</varname> of the affected ports.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proposing-reorg">
      <title>Proposing Reorganizing All the Categories</title>

      <para>Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the
	categories with either a 2-level structure, or some other kind
	of keyword structure.  To date, nothing has come of any of
	these proposals because, while they are very easy to make, the
	effort involved to retrofit the entire existing ports
	collection with any kind of reorganization is daunting to say
	the very least.  Please read the history of these proposals in
	the mailing list archives before posting this idea.
	Furthermore, be prepared to be challenged to offer

	in two places.  First, the distribution file list
	(<varname>DISTFILES</varname>) defaults to
	<literal>${DISTNAME}</literal><literal>${EXTRACT_SUFX}</literal>.
	Second, the distribution file is expected to extract into a

      <para>Some vendor's distribution names which do not fit into the

	<varname>DISTVERSION</varname>.
	<varname>PORTVERSION</varname> will be derived from it

      <note>
	<para>Only one of <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> and
	  <varname>DISTVERSION</varname> can be set at a time.  If
	  <varname>DISTVERSION</varname> does not derive a correct
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname>, do not use
	  <varname>DISTVERSION</varname>, set
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> to the right value and set
	  <varname>DISTNAME</varname> with <varname>PORTNAME</varname>
	  with either some computation of

	<para>Multiple values are added to
	  <varname>GH_ACCOUNT</varname>,
	  <varname>GH_PROJECT</varname>, and
	  <varname>GH_TAGNAME</varname>.  Each different value is

	  omitted if it is the same as the default as listed in
	  <xref
	    linkend="makefile-master_sites-github-description"/>.</para>

	<para>For each tag, a
	  <varname>${WRKSRC_<replaceable>tag</replaceable>}</varname>
	  helper variable is created, containing the directory into
	  which the file has been extracted.  The
	  <varname>${WRKSRC_<replaceable>tag</replaceable>}</varname>
	  variables can be used to move directories around during

      <para>If the patch is not relative to the top of the source tree

      <para>Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be

      <para>If the patch is distributed with some other files, such as

      <tip>
	<para>If there are multiple patches and they need mixed values

      <note>
	<para>The tarball will have been extracted alongside the

	  extract it if it is a regular <command>gzip</command>ped or
	  <command>compress</command>ed tarball.  Take extra care not

      <title>Multiple Distribution or Patches Files from Multiple

      <para>(Consider this to be a somewhat
	<quote>advanced topic</quote>; those new to this document
	may wish to skip this section at first).</para>

      <para>This section has information on the fetching mechanism
	known as both <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> and
	<literal>MASTER_SITES_NN</literal>.  We will refer to this
	mechanism as <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>.</para>

      <para>A little background first.  OpenBSD has a neat feature
	inside <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	<varname>PATCHFILES</varname> which allows files and
	patches to be postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
	identifiers.  Here, <literal>n</literal> can be both
	<literal>[0-9]</literal> and denote a group designation.  For
	example:</para>

      <programlisting>DISTFILES=	alpha:0 beta:1</programlisting>

      <para>In OpenBSD, distribution file <filename>alpha</filename>
	will be associated with variable
	<varname>MASTER_SITES0</varname> instead of our common
	<varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> and
	<filename>beta</filename> with
	<varname>MASTER_SITES1</varname>.</para>

      <para>This is a very interesting feature which can decrease
	that endless search for the correct download site.</para>

      <para>Just picture 2 files in <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	20 sites in <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, the sites slow as
	hell where <filename>beta</filename> is carried by all sites
	in <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, and
	<filename>alpha</filename> can only be found in the 20th site.
	It would be such a waste to check all of them if the
	maintainer knew this beforehand, would it not?  Not a good
	start for that lovely weekend!</para>

      <para>Now that you have the idea, just imagine more
	<varname>DISTFILES</varname> and more
	<varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  Surely our
	<quote>distfiles survey meister</quote> would appreciate the
	relief to network strain that this would bring.</para>

      <para>In the next sections, information will follow on the
	&os; implementation of this idea.  We improved a bit on
	OpenBSD's concept.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="porting-master-sites-n-simplified">
	<title>Simplified Information</title>

	<para>This section explains how to quickly prepare fine
	  grained fetching of multiple distribution files and patches
	  from different sites and subdirectories.  We describe here a
	  case of simplified <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> usage.
	  This will be sufficient for most scenarios.  More detailed
	  information are available in <xref
	    linkend="ports-master-sites-n-detailed"/>.</para>

	<para>Some applications consist of multiple distribution files
	  that must be downloaded from a number of different sites.
	  For example, <application>Ghostscript</application> consists
	  of the core of the program, and then a large number of
	  driver files that are used depending on the user's printer.
	  Some of these driver files are supplied with the core, but
	  many others must be downloaded from a variety of different
	  sites.</para>

	<para>To support this, each entry in
	  <varname>DISTFILES</varname> may be followed by a colon and
	  a <quote>tag name</quote>.  Each site listed in
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> is then followed by a colon,
	  and the tag that indicates which distribution files are
	  downloaded from this site.</para>

	<para>For example, consider an application with the source
	  split in two parts, <filename>source1.tar.gz</filename> and
	  <filename>source2.tar.gz</filename>, which must be
	  downloaded from two different sites.  The port's
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> would include lines like <xref
	    linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site"/>.</para>

	<example

DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz:source1 \

	</example>

	<para>Multiple distribution files can have the same tag.
	  Continuing the previous example, suppose that there was a

	challenge for port maintainers</link>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>A maintainer volunteers to keep a port in good working
	order.  Maintainers have the primary responsibility for their
	ports, but not exclusive ownership.  Ports exist for the
	benefit of the community and, in reality, belong to the
	community.  What this means is that people other than the
	maintainer can make changes to a port.  Large changes to the
	Ports Collection might require changes to many ports.  The
	&os; Ports Management Team or members of other teams might
	modify ports to fix dependency issues or other problems, like
	a version bump for a shared library update.</para>

      <para>Some types of fixes have <quote>blanket approval</quote>
	from the &a.portmgr;, allowing any committer to fix those
	categories of problems on any port.  These fixes do not need
	approval from the maintainer.  Blanket approval does not apply
	to ports that are maintained by teams like <email
	  role="nolink">autotools@FreeBSD.org</email>, <email
	  role="nolink">x11@FreeBSD.org</email>, <email
	  role="nolink">gnome@FreeBSD.org</email>, or <email
	  role="nolink">kde@FreeBSD.org</email>.  These teams use
	external repositories and can have work that would conflict
	with changes that would normally fall under blanket
	approval.</para>

      <para>Blanket approval for most ports applies to these types of
	fixes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Most infrastructure changes to a port (that is,
	    modernizing, but not changing the functionality).  For
	    example, converting to staging,

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </note>

    <para>Other changes to the port will be sent to the maintainer
      for review and approval before being committed.  If the
      maintainer does not respond to an update request after two weeks
      (excluding major public holidays), then that is considered a
      maintainer timeout, and the update may be made without explicit
      maintainer approval.  If the maintainer does not respond within
      three months, or if there have been three consecutive timeouts,
      then that maintainer is considered absent without
      leave, and can be replaced as the maintainer of the particular
      port in question.  Exceptions to this are anything maintained by
      the &a.portmgr;, or the &a.security-officer;.  No unauthorized
      commits may ever be made to ports maintained by those
      groups.</para>

    <para>We reserve the right to modify the maintainer's submission
      to better match existing policies and style of the Ports
      Collection without explicit blessing from the submitter or the
      maintainer.  Also,
      large infrastructural changes can result in a port being
      modified without the maintainer's consent.  These kinds of
      changes will never affect the port's functionality.</para>

    <para>The &a.portmgr; reserves the right to revoke or override

    <title>Dependencies</title>

    <para>Many ports depend on other ports.  This is a very convenient
      feature of most Unix-like operating systems, including &os;.
      Multiple ports can share a common dependency, rather than
      bundling that dependency with every port or package that needs
      it.  There are seven variables that can be used to ensure that
      all the required bits will be on the user's machine.  There are
      also some pre-supported dependency variables for common cases,
      plus a few more to control the behavior of dependencies.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="makefile-lib_depends">
      <title><varname>LIB_DEPENDS</varname></title>

      <para>This variable specifies the shared libraries this port
	depends on.  It is a list of
	<replaceable>lib</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable>
	tuples where <replaceable>lib</replaceable> is the name of
	the shared library, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the
	directory in which to find it in case it is not available.
	For example,</para>

      <programlisting>LIB_DEPENDS=   libjpeg.so:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg</programlisting>

      <para>will check for a shared jpeg library with any version, and
	descend into the <filename>graphics/jpeg</filename>
	subdirectory of the ports tree to build and install it if it
	is not found.</para>

      <para>The dependency is checked twice, once from within the
	<buildtarget>build</buildtarget> target and then from within
	the <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target.  Also, the name
	of the dependency is put into the package so that
	<command>pkg install</command> (see &man.pkg-install.8;) will
	automatically install it if it is not on the user's
	system.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="makefile-run_depends">
      <title><varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname></title>

	the executable or file, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the

	<replaceable>target</replaceable> is the target to call in
	that directory.  If <replaceable>path</replaceable> starts
	with a slash (<literal>/</literal>), it is treated as a file
	and its existence is tested with <command>test -e</command>;
	otherwise, it is assumed to be an executable, and
	<command>which -s</command> is used to determine if the
	program exists in the search path.</para>

      <para>For example,</para>

      <programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${LOCALBASE}/news/bin/innd:${PORTSDIR}/news/inn \

	subdirectory of the ports tree if it is not found.  It will
	also see if an executable called <command>xmlcatmgr</command>
	is in the search path, and descend into
	<filename>textproc/xmlcatmgr</filename>
	to build and install it if it is not found.</para>

      <note>
	<para>In this case, <command>innd</command> is actually an

      <para>A quite common situation is when

	both tempting and intuitive to directly assign one to the
	other:</para>

      <programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${BUILD_DEPENDS}</programlisting>

      <para>However, such assignment can pollute run-time
	dependencies with entries not defined in the port's original
	<varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.  This happens because of
	&man.make.1;'s lazy evaluation of variable assignment.
	Consider a <filename>Makefile</filename> with
	<varname>USE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></varname>,
	which are processed by <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.*.mk</filename>
	to augment initial build dependencies.  For example,
	<literal>USES= gmake</literal> adds
	<package role="port">devel/gmake</package> to
	<varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.  To prevent such additional
	dependencies from polluting <varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname>,
	create another variable with the current content of

      package to make it easier for users to see what to do, but try
      to share as many files as possible between ports.  Typically, by
      using variables cleverly, only a very short
      <filename>Makefile</filename> is needed in all but one of the
      directories.  In the sole <filename>Makefile</filename>, use
      <varname>MASTERDIR</varname> to specify the directory where the
      rest of the files are.  Also, use a variable as part of <link
	linkend="porting-pkgname"><varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname></link>
      so the packages will have different names.</para>

    <para>This will be best demonstrated by an example.  This is part
      of <filename>japanese/xdvi300/Makefile</filename>;</para>

	@${ECHO_MSG} "Error: invalid value for RESOLUTION: \"${RESOLUTION}\""
	@${ECHO_MSG} "Possible values are: 118, 240, 300 (default) and 400."
	@${FALSE}
.endif</programlisting>

    <para><package role="port">japanese/xdvi300</package> also has all
      the regular patches, package files, etc.  Running
      <command>make</command> there, it will take the default value
      for the resolution (300) and build the port normally.</para>

    <para>As for other resolutions, this is the
      <emphasis>entire</emphasis>
      <filename>xdvi118/Makefile</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>RESOLUTION=	118

.include "${MASTERDIR}/Makefile"</programlisting>

    <para>(<filename>xdvi240/Makefile</filename> and
      <filename>xdvi400/Makefile</filename> are similar).
      <varname>MASTERDIR</varname> definition tells
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> that the regular set of
      subdirectories like <varname>FILESDIR</varname> and
      <varname>SCRIPTDIR</varname> are to be found under
      <filename>xdvi300</filename>.  The
      <literal>RESOLUTION=118</literal> line will override the
      <literal>RESOLUTION=300</literal> line in
      <filename>xdvi300/Makefile</filename> and the port will be built
      with resolution set to 118.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="makefile-manpages">

    <para>If the port anchors its man tree somewhere other than
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>, use
      <varname>MANDIRS</varname> to specify those directories.  Note
      that the files corresponding to manual pages must be placed in
      <filename>pkg-plist</filename> along with the rest of the files.
      The purpose of <varname>MANDIRS</varname> is to enable automatic
      compression of manual pages, therefore the file names are
      suffixed with <filename>.gz</filename>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="makefile-info">
    <title>Info Files</title>

    <para>If the package needs to install <acronym>GNU</acronym> info
      files, list them in <varname>INFO</varname> (without the
      trailing <literal>.info</literal>), one entry per document.
      These files are assumed to be installed to
      <filename>PREFIX/INFO_PATH</filename>.  Change
      <varname>INFO_PATH</varname> if the package uses a different
      location.  However, this is not recommended.  These entries
      contain just the path relative to
      <filename>PREFIX/INFO_PATH</filename>.  For example,
      <package role="port">lang/gcc34</package> installs info files to
      <filename>PREFIX/INFO_PATH/gcc34</filename>, and
      <varname>INFO</varname> will be something like this:</para>

    <programlisting>INFO=	gcc34/cpp gcc34/cppinternals gcc34/g77 ...</programlisting>

      language, GUI versus command-line, or type of database to

      default, so the ports system provides hooks the port author can

    <title>Specifying the Working Directory</title>

    <para>Each port is extracted into a working directory, which must
      be writable.  The ports system defaults to having
      <varname>DISTFILES</varname> unpack in to a directory called
      <literal>${DISTNAME}</literal>.  In other words, if the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> has:</para>

    <programlisting>PORTNAME=	foo
PORTVERSION=	1.0</programlisting>

    <para>then the port's distribution files contain a top-level
      directory, <filename>foo-1.0</filename>, and the rest of the
      files are located under that directory.</para>

      not the case.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="makefile-wrksrc">
      <title><varname>WRKSRC</varname></title>

      <para>The variable lists the name of the directory that is
	created when the application's distfiles are extracted.  If
	our previous example extracted into a directory called
	<filename>foo</filename> (and not
	<filename>foo-1.0</filename>) write:</para>

      <title>Stripping Binaries and Shared Libraries</title>

      <para>Installed binaries should be stripped.  Do not strip
	binaries manually unless absolutely required.  The
	<varname>INSTALL_PROGRAM</varname> macro installs and
	strips a binary at the same time.  The
	<varname>INSTALL_LIB</varname> macro does the same thing to
	shared libraries.</para>

      <para>When a file must be stripped, but neither
	<varname>INSTALL_PROGRAM</varname> nor
	<varname>INSTALL_LIB</varname> macros are desirable,
	<literal>${STRIP_CMD}</literal> strips the program or
	shared library.  This is typically done within the
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target.  For
	example:</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	${STRIP_CMD} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/bin/xdl</programlisting>

      <para>When multiple files need to be stripped:</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
.for l in geometry media body track world
	${STRIP_CMD} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/lib${PORTNAME}-${l}.so.0
.endfor</programlisting>

      <para>Use &man.file.1; on a file to determine if it has been
	stripped.  Binaries are reported by &man.file.1; as
	<literal>stripped</literal>, or
	<literal>not stripped</literal>.  Additionally, &man.strip.1;
	will detect programs that have already been stripped and exit
	cleanly.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="install-copytree">
      <title>Installing a Whole Tree of Files</title>

      <para>Sometimes, a large number of files must be installed while
	preserving their hierarchical organization.  For example,
	copying over a whole directory tree from
	<varname>WRKSRC</varname> to a target directory under
	<varname>PREFIX</varname>.  Note that
	<varname>PREFIX</varname>, <varname>EXAMPLESDIR</varname>,
	<varname>DATADIR</varname>, and other path variables must
	always be prepended with <varname>STAGEDIR</varname> to
	respect staging (see <xref linkend="staging"/>).</para>

      <para>Two macros exist for this situation.  The advantage of
	using these macros instead of <command>cp</command> is that
	they guarantee proper file ownership and permissions on target
	files.  The first macro, <varname>COPYTREE_BIN</varname>, will
	set all the installed files to be executable, thus being
	suitable for installing into <filename>PREFIX/bin</filename>.
	The second macro, <varname>COPYTREE_SHARE</varname>, does not
	set executable permissions on files, and is therefore suitable
	for installing files under <filename>PREFIX/share</filename>
	target.</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}
	(cd ${WRKSRC}/examples &amp;&amp; ${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR})</programlisting>

      <para>This example will install the contents of the
	<filename>examples</filename> directory in the vendor distfile
	to the proper examples location of the port.</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${DATADIR}/summer
	(cd ${WRKSRC}/temperatures &amp;&amp; ${COPYTREE_SHARE} "June July August" ${STAGEDIR}${DATADIR}/summer)</programlisting>

      <para>And this example will install the data of summer months to
	the <filename>summer</filename> subdirectory of a
	<filename>DATADIR</filename>.</para>

      <para>Additional <command>find</command> arguments can be
	passed via the third argument to
	<varname>COPYTREE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></varname>
	macros.  For example, to install
	all files from the first example except Makefiles, one can use
	these commands.</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}
	(cd ${WRKSRC}/examples &amp;&amp; \
	${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR} "! -name Makefile")</programlisting>

      <para>These macros do not add the installed files to
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  They must be added manually.
	For optional documentation (<varname>PORTDOCS</varname>, see
	<xref linkend="install-documentation"/>) and examples
	(<varname>PORTEXAMPLES</varname>), the
	<literal>%%PORTDOCS%%</literal> or
	<literal>%%PORTEXAMPLES%%</literal> prefixes must be prepended
	in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="install-documentation">
      <title>Install Additional Documentation</title>

      <para>If the software has some documentation other than the
	standard man and info pages that is useful for the
	user, install it under <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>
	This can be done, like the previous item, in the
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target.</para>

      <para>Create a new directory for the port.  The directory name
	is <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>.  This usually equals
	<varname>PORTNAME</varname>.  However, if the user
	might want different versions of the port to be installed at
	the same time, the whole
	<varname>PKGNAME</varname> can be used.</para>

      <para>Since only the files listed in
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> are installed, it is safe to
	always install documentation to <varname>STAGEDIR</varname>
	(see <xref linkend="staging"/>).  Hence <literal>.if</literal>
	blocks are only needed when the installed files are large
	enough to cause significant I/O overhead.</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}
	${INSTALL_MAN} ${WRKSRC}/docs/xvdocs.ps ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}</programlisting>

      <para>Here are some handy variables and how they are expanded by
	default when used in the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>DATADIR</varname> gets expanded to
	    <filename>PREFIX/share/PORTNAME</filename>.</para>

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <note>
	<para>The <literal>DOCS</literal> option only controls
	  additional documentation installed in
	  <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>.  It does not apply to standard
	  man pages and info pages.  Things installed in
	  <varname>DATADIR</varname> and
	  <varname>EXAMPLESDIR</varname> are controlled by
	  <literal>DATA</literal> and <literal>EXAMPLES</literal>
	  options, respectively.</para>
      </note>

      <para>These variables are exported to
	<varname>PLIST_SUB</varname>.  Their values will appear there
	as pathnames relative to <filename>PREFIX</filename> if
	possible.  That is, <filename>share/doc/PORTNAME</filename>
	will be substituted for <literal>%%DOCSDIR%%</literal> in the
	packing list by default, and so on.  (See more on
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> substitution
	<link linkend="plist-sub">here</link>.)</para>

      <para>All conditionally installed documentation files and
	directories are included in
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> with the
	<literal>%%PORTDOCS%%</literal> prefix, for example:</para>

      <programlisting>%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/AUTHORS
%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT</programlisting>

      <para>As an alternative to enumerating the documentation files
	in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, a port can set the variable
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname> to a list of file names and shell
	glob patterns to add to the final packing list.  The names
	will be relative to <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>.  Therefore, a
	port that utilizes <varname>PORTDOCS</varname>, and uses a
	non-default location for its documentation, must set
	<varname>DOCSDIR</varname> accordingly.  If a directory is
	listed in <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> or matched by a glob
	pattern from this variable, the entire subtree of contained
	files and directories will be registered in the final packing
	list.  If the <literal>DOCS</literal> option has been unset
	then files and directories listed in
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname> would not be installed or added to
	port packing list.  Installing the documentation at
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname> as shown above remains up to the
	port itself.  A typical example of utilizing
	<varname>PORTDOCS</varname> looks as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>PORTDOCS=	README.* ChangeLog docs/*</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>The equivalents of <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> for files
	  installed under <varname>DATADIR</varname> and
	  <varname>EXAMPLESDIR</varname> are
	  <varname>PORTDATA</varname> and
	  <varname>PORTEXAMPLES</varname>, respectively.</para>

	<para>The contents of <filename>pkg-message</filename> are
	  displayed upon installation.  See
	  <link linkend="porting-message">the section on using
	  <filename>pkg-message</filename></link> for details.
	  <filename>pkg-message</filename> does not need to be added
	  to <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="install-subdirs">
      <title>Subdirectories Under <varname>PREFIX</varname></title>

      <para>Try to let the port put things in the right subdirectories
	of <varname>PREFIX</varname>.  Some ports lump everything and
	put it in the subdirectory with the port's name, which is
	incorrect.  Also, many ports put everything except binaries,
	header files and manual pages in a subdirectory of
	<filename>lib</filename>, which does not work well with the
	BSD paradigm.  Many of the files must be moved to one of these
	directories: <filename>etc</filename> (setup/configuration
	files), <filename>libexec</filename> (executables started
	internally), <filename>sbin</filename> (executables for
	superusers/managers), <filename>info</filename> (documentation
	for info browser) or <filename>share</filename> (architecture
	independent files).  See &man.hier.7; for details; the rules
	governing <filename>/usr</filename> pretty much apply to
	<filename>/usr/local</filename> too.  The exception are ports
	dealing with USENET <quote>news</quote>.  They may use
	<filename>PREFIX/news</filename> as a destination for their
	files.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The FreeBSD ports collection is the way almost everyone
      installs applications ("ports") on FreeBSD.  Like everything
      else about FreeBSD, it is primarily a volunteer effort.
      It is important to keep this in mind when reading this
      document.</para>

    <para>In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer
      to maintain an existing port if it is unmaintained&mdash;you
      do not need any special commit privileges to do so.</para>

  </chapter>

  <chapter xml:id="own-port">
    <title>Making a New Port Yourself</title>

    <para>So, you are interested in making your own port or
      upgrading an existing one?  Great!</para>

    <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
      FreeBSD.  If you want to upgrade an existing port, you should
      read this and then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading"/>.</para>

    <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed, you should
      refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which
      all port Makefiles include.  Even if you do not hack Makefiles
      daily, it is well commented, and you will still gain much
      knowledge from it.  Additionally, you may send specific
      questions to the &a.ports;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Only a fraction of the variables
	(<varname><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></varname>) that can
	be overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not
	all) are documented at the start of
	<filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>; the others
	probably ought to be.  Note that this file uses a non-standard
	tab setting: <application>Emacs</application> and
	<application>Vim</application> should recognize the setting on
	loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and &man.ex.1; can be set
	to use the correct value by typing
	<command>:set tabstop=4</command> once the file has been
	loaded.</para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Looking for something easy to start with? Take a look at the
      <link xlink:href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/WantedPorts">list of
	requested ports</link> and see if you can work on one (or
      more).</para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter xml:id="quick-porting">
    <title>Quick Porting</title>

    <para>This section tells you how to quickly create a new port.  In
      many cases, it is not sufficient, so you will have to read
      further on into the document.</para>

    <para>First, get the original tarball and put it into
      <varname>DISTDIR</varname>, which defaults to
      <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles</filename>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The following assumes that the software compiled
	out-of-the-box, i.e., there was absolutely no change required
	for the port to work on your FreeBSD box.  If you needed to
	change something, you will have to refer to the next section
	too.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>It is recommended to set the <varname>DEVELOPER</varname>
	&man.make.1; variable in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>
	before getting into porting.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo DEVELOPER=yes &gt;&gt; /etc/make.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>This setting enables the <quote>developer mode</quote> that
	displays deprecation warnings and activates some further quality
	checks on calling the <command>make</command> command.</para>
    </note>

    <sect1 xml:id="porting-makefile">
      <title>Writing the <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

      <para>The minimal <filename>Makefile</filename> would look
	something like this:</para>

      <programlisting># &dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;

PORTNAME=	oneko
PORTVERSION=	1.1b
CATEGORIES=	games
MASTER_SITES=	ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/X11R5/contrib/

MAINTAINER=	youremail@example.com
COMMENT=	Cat chasing a mouse all over the screen
.include &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>In some cases, the <filename>Makefile</filename> of an
	  existing port may contain additional lines in the header,
	  such as the name of the port and the date it was created.
	  This additional information has been declared obsolete, and
	  is being phased out.</para>
      </note>

      <para>See if you can figure it out.  Do not worry about the
	contents of the <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal>
	line, it will be filled in automatically by SVN when the port
	is imported to our main ports tree.  You can find a more
	detailed example in the
	<link linkend="porting-samplem">sample Makefile</link>
	section.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="porting-desc">
      <title>Writing the Description Files</title>

      <para>There are two description files that are required for
	any port, whether they actually package or not.  They are
	<filename>pkg-descr</filename> and
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  Their
	<filename>pkg-</filename> prefix distinguishes them from other
	files.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><filename>pkg-descr</filename></title>

	<para>This is a longer description of the port.  One to a few
	  paragraphs concisely explaining what the port does is
	  sufficient.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a manual or an
	    in-depth description on how to use or compile the port!
	    <emphasis>Please be careful if you are copying from the
	    <filename>README</filename> or manpage</emphasis>; too
	    often they are not a concise description of the port or
	    are in an awkward format (e.g., manpages have justified
	    spacing, as it looks particularly bad with monospaced
	    fonts).</para>
	</note>

	<para>A well-written <filename>pkg-descr</filename> describes
	  the port completely enough that users would not have to
	  consult the documentation or visit the website to understand
	  what the software does, how it can be useful, or what
	  particularly nice features it has.  Mentioning certain
	  requirements like a graphical toolkit, heavy dependencies,
	  runtime environment, or implementation languages help users
	  decide whether this port will work for them.</para>

	<para>Include a URL to the official WWW homepage.  Prepend
	  <emphasis>one</emphasis> of the websites (pick the most
	  common one) with <literal>WWW:</literal> (followed by single
	  space) so that automated tools will work correctly.  If the
	  URI is the root of the website or directory, it should be
	  terminated with a slash.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>If the listed webpage for a port is not available, try
	    to search the Internet first to see if the official site
	    moved, was renamed, or is hosted elsewhere.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The following example shows how your
	  <filename>pkg-descr</filename> should look:</para>

	<programlisting>This is a port of oneko, in which a cat chases a poor mouse all over
the screen.
 :
(etc.)

WWW: http://www.oneko.org/</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><filename>pkg-plist</filename></title>

	<para>This file lists all the files installed by the port.  It
	  is also called the <quote>packing list</quote> because the
	  package is generated by packing the files listed here.  The
	  pathnames are relative to the installation prefix (usually
	  <filename>/usr/local</filename>.
	  If the
	  port creates directories during installation, make sure to
	  add <literal>@dirrm</literal> lines to remove them when the
	  package is deleted.</para>

	<para>Here is a small example:</para>

	<programlisting>bin/oneko
man/man1/oneko.1.gz
lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
@dirrm lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	<para>Refer to the &man.pkg.create.1; manual page for details
	  on the packing list.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>It is recommended that you keep all the filenames in
	    this file sorted alphabetically.  It will make verifying
	    the changes when you upgrade the port much easier.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>Creating a packing list manually can be a very tedious
	    task.  If the port installs a large numbers of files,
	    <link linkend="plist-autoplist">creating the packing list
	      automatically</link> might save time.</para>
	</note>

	<para>There is only one case when
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> can be omitted from a port.
	  If the port installs just a handful of files, and perhaps
	  directories, the files and directories may be listed in the
	  variables <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> and
	  <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>, respectively, within the
	  port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For instance, we
	  could get along without <filename>pkg-plist</filename> in
	  the above <filename>oneko</filename> port by adding the
	  following lines to the <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>PLIST_FILES=	bin/oneko \
		man/man1/oneko.1.gz \
		lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
PLIST_DIRS=	lib/X11/oneko</programlisting>

	<para>Of course, <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> should be left
	  unset if a port installs no directories of its own.</para>

	<note>

	  <para>Several ports can share a common directory.  In that
	    case, <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> should be replaced by
	    <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> so that the directory is
	    removed only if empty, otherwise it is silently ignored.
	    <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname> and
	    <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> are equivalent to using
	    <literal>@dirrm</literal> and <literal>@dirrmtry</literal>
	    in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, as described in
	    <xref linkend="plist-dir-cleaning"/>.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The price for this way of listing port's files and
	  directories is that you cannot use command sequences
	  described in &man.pkg.create.1;.  Therefore, it is suitable
	  only for simple ports and makes them even simpler.  At the
	  same time, it has the advantage of reducing the number of
	  files in the ports collection.  Please consider using this
	  technique before you resort to
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>Later we will see how <filename>pkg-plist</filename>
	  and <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> can be used to fulfill
	  <link linkend="plist">more sophisticated
	    tasks</link>.</para>

      <para>If a file fetched has its checksum changed regularly and

      <title>How Things Work</title>

      <para>First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when

	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> is doing, not many people
	do...  <!-- smiley --><emphasis>:-)</emphasis></para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>The <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> target is run.  The
	    <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> target is responsible for
	    making sure that the tarball exists locally in
	    <varname>DISTDIR</varname>.  If
	    <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> cannot find the required
	    files in <varname>DISTDIR</varname> it will look up the
	    URL <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, which is set in the
	    Makefile, as well as our FTP mirrors
	    where we put distfiles as backup.  It will then
	    attempt to fetch the named distribution file with
	    <varname>FETCH</varname>, assuming that the requesting
	    site has direct access to the Internet.  If that succeeds,
	    it will save the file in <varname>DISTDIR</varname> for
	    future use and proceed.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget> target is run.
	    It looks for your port's distribution file (typically a
	    <command>gzip</command>ped tarball) in
	    <varname>DISTDIR</varname> and unpacks it into a temporary
	    subdirectory specified by <varname>WRKDIR</varname>
	    (defaults to <filename>work</filename>).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <buildtarget>patch</buildtarget> target is run.
	    First, any patches defined in

	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The <buildtarget>stage</buildtarget> target is run.  This
	    puts the final set of built files into a temporary directory

	    mirrors that of the system on which the package will be
	    installed.</para>

	<step>
	  <para>The <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target is run.
	    This copies the files listed in the port's pkg-plist to
	    the host system.</para>

      </procedure>

      <para>The above are the default actions.  In addition, you can

	simple enough, because it will be easier for someone to figure

      <para>The default actions are done by the

	<buildtarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>.
	For example, the commands to extract a port are in the target
	<buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget>.  If you are not happy
	with the default target, you can fix it by redefining the
	<buildtarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>
	target in your <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>The <quote>main</quote> targets (e.g.,
	  <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget>,
	  <buildtarget>configure</buildtarget>, etc.) do nothing more
	  than make sure all the stages up to that one are completed
	  and call the real targets or scripts, and they are not
	  intended to be changed.  If you want to fix the extraction,
	  fix <buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget>, but never ever
	  change the way <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget>
	  operates! Additionally, the target
	  <buildtarget>post-deinstall</buildtarget> is invalid and
	  is not run by the ports infrastructure.</para>

	sites&mdash;and the associated definitions&mdash;if at all
	possible, to help avoid the problem of having the same
	information repeated over again many times in the source base.
	As these sites tend to change over time, this becomes a
	maintenance nightmare for everyone involved.</para>

      <para>If you cannot find a FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected
	to the net, or can only find sites that have irritatingly
	non-standard formats, you might want to put a copy on a
	reliable FTP or HTTP server that you control (e.g., your home
	page).</para>

      <para>If you cannot find somewhere convenient and reliable to

	<systemitem>ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>; however, this is the
	least-preferred solution.  The distfile must be placed into

      <title>Patching</title>

      <para>In the preparation of the port, files that have been added
	or changed can be picked up with a &man.diff.1; for later
	feeding to &man.patch.1;.  Each patch you wish to apply should
	be saved into a file named
	<filename>patch-*</filename> where
	<replaceable>*</replaceable> indicates the pathname of the
	file that is patched, such as
	<filename>patch-Imakefile</filename> or
	<filename>patch-src-config.h</filename>.  These files should
	be stored in <varname>PATCHDIR</varname> (usually
	<filename>files/</filename>, from where they will be
	automatically applied.  All patches must be relative to
	<varname>WRKSRC</varname> (generally the directory your port's
	tarball unpacks itself into, that being where the build is
	done).  To make fixes and upgrades easier, you should avoid
	having more than one patch fix the same file (e.g.,
	<filename>patch-file</filename> and
	<filename>patch-file2</filename> both changing
	<filename>WRKSRC/foobar.c</filename>).
	Note that if the path of a patched file contains an underscore
	(<literal>_</literal>) character, the patch needs to have two
	underscores instead in its name.  For example, to patch a file
	named <filename>src/freeglut_joystick.c</filename>, the
	corresponding patch should be named
	<filename>patch-src-freeglut__joystick.c</filename>.</para>

      <para>Please only use characters
	<literal>[-+._a-zA-Z0-9]</literal> for naming your patches.
	Do not use any other characters besides them.  Do not name
	your patches like <filename>patch-aa</filename> or
	<filename>patch-ab</filename> etc, always mention the path and
	file name in patch names.</para>

      <para>Do not put RCS strings in patches.  SVN will mangle them
	when we put the files into the ports tree, and when we check
	them out again, they will come out different and the patch
	will fail.  RCS strings are surrounded by dollar
	(<literal>&dollar;</literal>) signs, and typically start with
	<literal>&dollar;Id</literal> or
	<literal>&dollar;RCS</literal>.</para>

      <para>Using the recurse (<option>-r</option>) option to
	&man.diff.1; to generate patches is fine, but please take a
	look at the resulting patches to make sure you do not have any
	unnecessary junk in there.  In particular, diffs between two
	backup files, <filename>Makefile</filename>s when the port
	uses <command>Imake</command> or GNU
	<command>configure</command>, etc., are unnecessary and should
	be deleted.  If you had to edit
	<filename>configure.in</filename> and run
	<command>autoconf</command> to regenerate
	<command>configure</command>, do not take the diffs of
	<command>configure</command> (it often grows to a few thousand
	lines!); define <literal>USE_AUTOTOOLS=autoconf:261</literal>
	and take the diffs of
	<filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

      <para>Also, try to minimize the amount of non-functional
	whitespace changes in your patches.  It is common in the Open
	Source world for projects to share large amounts of a code
	base, but obey different style and indenting rules.  If you
	take a working piece of functionality from one project to fix
	similar areas in another, please be careful: the resulting
	line patch may be full of non-functional changes.  It not only
	increases the size of the SVN repository but makes it hard to
	find out what exactly caused the problem and what you changed
	at all.</para>

      <para>If you had to delete a file, then you can do it in the
	<buildtarget>post-extract</buildtarget> target rather than as
	part of the patch.</para>

      <para>Simple replacements can be performed directly from the
	port <filename>Makefile</filename> using the in-place mode of
	&man.sed.1;.  This is very useful when you need to patch in a
	variable value.  Example:</para>

      <programlisting>post-patch:
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|for Linux|for FreeBSD|g' ${WRKSRC}/README</programlisting>

      <para>Quite often, software being ported uses the CR/LF
	convention for its source files.  This may cause problems with
	further patching, compiler warnings, scripts execution (e.g.,
	<command>/bin/sh^M</command> not found.) To quickly convert
	all files from CR/LF to just LF, add
	<literal>USE_DOS2UNIX=yes</literal> to the port
	<filename>Makefile</filename>.  A list of files to convert can
	be specified:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_DOS2UNIX=	util.c util.h</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to convert a group of files across
	subdirectories, <varname>DOS2UNIX_REGEX</varname> can be used.
	Its argument is a <command>find</command> compatible regular
	expression.  More on the format is in &man.re.format.7;.  This
	option is useful for converting all files of a given
	extension, for example all source code files leaving binary
	files intact:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_DOS2UNIX=	yes
DOS2UNIX_REGEX=	.*\.(c|cpp|h)</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to create a patch file based off of an
	existing file, you can copy it with an
	<filename>.orig</filename> extension, and then modify the
	original one.  The <buildtarget>makepatch</buildtarget> target
	will write out an appropriate patch file to the <filename>files</filename> directory of the

      <para>If your port requires user input to build, configure, or

	  <title><varname>PORTEPOCH</varname></title>

	  <para>From time to time a software vendor or FreeBSD porter
	    will do something silly and release a version of their
	    software which is actually numerically less than the
	    previous version.  An example of this is a port which goes
	    from foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be
	    incorrectly treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a
	    numerically greater value than 1).</para>

	  <tip>
	    <para>The results of version number comparisons are not
	      always obvious.  &man.pkg.version.1; can be used to test
	      the comparison of two version number strings.  The
	      <application>pkgng</application> equivalent is
	      <command>pkg version -t</command>.  For example:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>pkg_version -t 0.031 0.29</userinput>
&gt;</screen>

	    <para>Or, for <application>pkgng</application>
	      users:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>pkg version -t 0.031 0.29</userinput>
&gt;</screen>

	    <para>The <literal>&gt;</literal> output indicates that
	      version 0.031 is considered greater than version 0.29,
	      which may not have been obvious to the porter.</para>
	  </tip>

	  <para>In situations such as this, the
	    <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> version should be increased.
	    If <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> is nonzero it is appended
	    to the package name as described in section 0 above.
	    <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> must never be decreased or
	    reset to zero, because that would cause comparison to a
	    package from an earlier epoch to fail (i.e., the package
	    would not be detected as out of date): the new version
	    number (e.g., <literal>1.0,1</literal> in the above
	    example) is still numerically less than the previous
	    version (20000801), but the <literal>,1</literal> suffix
	    is treated specially by automated tools and found to be
	    greater than the implied suffix <literal>,0</literal> on
	    the earlier package.</para>

	  <para>Dropping or resetting <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname>
	    incorrectly leads to no end of grief; if you do not
	    understand the above discussion, please keep after it
	    until you do, or ask questions on the mailing
	    lists.</para>

	  <para>It is expected that <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname> will
	    not be used for the majority of ports, and that sensible
	    use of <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> can often preempt it
	    becoming necessary if a future release of the software
	    should change the version structure.  However, care is
	    needed by FreeBSD porters when a vendor release is made
	    without an official version number &mdash; such as a code
	    <quote>snapshot</quote> release.  The temptation is to
	    label the release with the release date, which will cause
	    problems as in the example above when a new
	    <quote>official</quote> release is made.</para>

	  <para>For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date
	    20000917, and the previous version of the software was
	    version 1.2, the snapshot release should be given a
	    <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> of 1.2.20000917 or similar,
	    not 20000917, so that the succeeding release, say 1.3, is
	    still a numerically greater value.</para>

	<para>Two optional variables, <varname>PKGNAMEPREFIX</varname>
	  and <varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname>, are combined with
	  <varname>PORTNAME</varname> and
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> to form
	  <varname>PKGNAME</varname> as
	  <literal>${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}${PKGNAMESUFFIX}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>.
	  Make sure this conforms to our
	  <link linkend="porting-pkgname">guidelines for a good
	    package name</link>.  In particular, you are
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> allowed to use a hyphen
	  (<literal>-</literal>) in <varname>PORTVERSION</varname>.
	  Also, if the package name has the
	  <replaceable>language-</replaceable> or the
	  <replaceable>-compiled.specifics</replaceable> part (see
	  below), use <varname>PKGNAMEPREFIX</varname> and
	  <varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname>, respectively.  Do not make
	  them part of <varname>PORTNAME</varname>.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>LATEST_LINK</varname></title>

	<para><varname>LATEST_LINK</varname> is used during package
	  building to determine a shortened name to create links that
	  can be used by <command>pkg_add -r</command>.  This makes it
	  possible to, for example, install the latest perl version by
	  running <command>pkg_add -r perl</command> without knowing
	  the exact version number.  This name needs to be unique and
	  obvious to users.</para>

	<para>In some cases, several versions of a program may be
	  present in the ports collection at the same time.  Both the
	  index build and the package build system need to be able to
	  see them as different, independent ports, although they may
	  all have the same <varname>PORTNAME</varname>,
	  <varname>PKGNAMEPREFIX</varname>, and even
	  <varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname>.  In those cases, the
	  optional <varname>LATEST_LINK</varname> variable should be
	  set to a different value for all ports except the
	  <quote>main</quote> one &mdash; see the
	  <filename>lang/gcc46</filename> and
	  <filename>lang/gcc</filename> ports, and the
	  <filename>www/apache*</filename> family for examples of its
	  use.  By setting <varname>NO_LATEST_LINK</varname>, no link
	  will be generated, which may be an option for all but the
	  <quote>main</quote> version.  Note that how to choose a
	  <quote>main</quote> version &mdash;
	  <quote>most popular</quote>, <quote>best supported</quote>,
	  <quote>least patched</quote>, and so on &mdash; is outside
	  the scope of this handbook's recommendations; we only tell
	  you how to specify the other ports' versions after you have
	  picked a <quote>main</quote> one.</para>

	<title>Package Naming Conventions</title>

	<para>The following are the conventions you should follow in
	  naming your packages.  This is to have our package directory
	  easy to scan, as there are already thousands of packages and
	  users are going to turn away if they hurt their eyes!</para>

	<para>The package name should look like
	  <filename>language_region-name-compiled.specifics-version.numbers</filename>.</para>

	<para>The package name is defined as
	  <literal>${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}${PKGNAMESUFFIX}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>.
	  Make sure to set the variables to conform to that
	  format.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>FreeBSD strives to support the native language of
	      its users.  The <replaceable>language-</replaceable>
	      part should be a two letter abbreviation of the natural
	      language defined by ISO-639 if the port is specific to a
	      certain language.  Examples are <literal>ja</literal>
	      for Japanese, <literal>ru</literal> for Russian,
	      <literal>vi</literal> for Vietnamese,
	      <literal>zh</literal> for Chinese, <literal>ko</literal>
	      for Korean and <literal>de</literal> for German.</para>

	    <para>If the port is specific to a certain region within
	      the language area, add the two letter country code as
	      well.  Examples are <literal>en_US</literal> for US
	      English and <literal>fr_CH</literal> for Swiss
	      French.</para>

	    <para>The <replaceable>language-</replaceable> part should
	      be set in the <varname>PKGNAMEPREFIX</varname>
	      variable.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first letter of the <filename>name</filename>
	      part should be lowercase.  (The rest of the name may
	      contain capital letters, so use your own discretion when
	      you are converting a software name that has some capital
	      letters in it.) There is a tradition of naming
	      <literal>Perl 5</literal> modules by prepending
	      <literal>p5-</literal> and converting the double-colon
	      separator to a hyphen; for example, the
	      <literal>Data::Dumper</literal> module becomes
	      <literal>p5-Data-Dumper</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Make sure that the port's name and version are
	      clearly separated and placed into the
	      <varname>PORTNAME</varname> and
	      <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> variables.  The only
	      reason for <varname>PORTNAME</varname> to contain a
	      version part is if the upstream distribution is really
	      named that way, as in the
	      <filename>textproc/libxml2</filename> or
	      <filename>japanese/kinput2-freewnn</filename> ports.
	      Otherwise, the <varname>PORTNAME</varname> should not
	      contain any version-specific information.  It is quite
	      normal for several ports to have the same
	      <varname>PORTNAME</varname>, as the
	      <filename>www/apache*</filename> ports do; in that case,
	      different versions (and different index entries) are
	      distinguished by the <varname>PKGNAMEPREFIX</varname>,
	      <varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname>, and
	      <varname>LATEST_LINK</varname> values.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the port can be built with different <link linkend="makefile-masterdir">hardcoded defaults</link>
	      (usually part of the directory name in a family of
	      ports), the
	      <replaceable>-compiled.specifics</replaceable> part
	      should state the compiled-in defaults (the hyphen is
	      optional).  Examples are paper size and font
	      units.</para>

	    <para>The <replaceable>-compiled.specifics</replaceable>
	      part should be set in the
	      <varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname> variable.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The version string should follow a dash
	      (<literal>-</literal>) and be a period-separated list of
	      integers and single lowercase alphabetics.  In
	      particular, it is not permissible to have another dash
	      inside the version string.  The only exception is the
	      string <literal>pl</literal> (meaning
	      <quote>patchlevel</quote>), which can be used
	      <emphasis>only</emphasis> when there are no major and
	      minor version numbers in the software.  If the software
	      version has strings like <quote>alpha</quote>,
	      <quote>beta</quote>, <quote>rc</quote>, or
	      <quote>pre</quote>, take the first letter and put it
	      immediately after a period.  If the version string
	      continues after those names, the numbers should follow
	      the single alphabet without an extra period between
	      them.</para>

	    <para>The idea is to make it easier to sort ports by
	      looking at the version string.  In particular, make sure
	      version number components are always delimited by a
	      period, and if the date is part of the string, use the
	      <literal>0.0.yyyy.mm.dd</literal>
	      format, not
	      <literal>dd.mm.yyyy</literal>
	      or the non-Y2K compliant
	      <literal>yy.mm.dd</literal>
	      format.  It is important to prefix the version with
	      <literal>0.0.</literal> in case a release with an actual
	      version number is made, which would of course be
	      numerically less than
	      <literal>yyyy</literal>.</para>

	<title>Choosing the Right Category</title>

	<para>As many of the categories overlap, you often have to
	  choose which of the categories should be the primary
	  category of your port.  There are several rules that govern
	  this issue.  Here is the list of priorities, in decreasing
	  order of precedence:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The first category must be a physical category (see
	      <link linkend="porting-categories">above</link>).  This
	      is necessary to make the packaging work.  Virtual
	      categories and physical categories may be intermixed
	      after that.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Language specific categories always come first.  For
	      example, if your port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then
	      your <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> line would read
	      <filename>japanese x11-fonts</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Specific categories are listed before less-specific
	      ones.  For instance, an HTML editor should be listed as
	      <filename>www editors</filename>, not the other way
	      around.  Also, you should not list
	      <filename>net</filename> when the port belongs to any of
	      <filename>irc</filename>, <filename>mail</filename>,
	      <filename>news</filename>,
	      <filename>security</filename>, or
	      <filename>www</filename>, as <filename>net</filename> is
	      included implicitly.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>x11</filename> is used as a secondary
	      category only when the primary category is a natural
	      language.  In particular, you should not put
	      <filename>x11</filename> in the category line for X
	      applications.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><application>Emacs</application> modes should be
	      placed in the same ports category as the application
	      supported by the mode, not in
	      <filename>editors</filename>.  For example, an
	      <application>Emacs</application> mode to edit source
	      files of some programming language should go into
	      <filename>lang</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Ports which install loadable kernel modules should
	      have the virtual category <filename>kld</filename> in
	      their <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> line.  This is one
	      of the things handled automatically by adding
	      <literal>kmod</literal> to the <varname>USES</varname>
	      line.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><filename>misc</filename> should not appear with any
	      other non-virtual category.  If you have
	      <literal>misc</literal> with something else in your
	      <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> line, that means you can
	      safely delete <literal>misc</literal> and just put the
	      port in that other subdirectory!</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If your port truly does not belong anywhere else,
	      put it in <filename>misc</filename>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If you are not sure about the category, please put a
	  comment to that effect in your &man.send-pr.1; submission so
	  we can discuss it before we import it.  If you are a
	  committer, send a note to the &a.ports; so we can discuss it
	  first.  Too often, new ports are imported to the wrong
	  category only to be moved right away.  This causes
	  unnecessary and undesirable bloat in the master source
	  repository.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="proposing-categories">
	<title>Proposing a New Category</title>

	<para>As the Ports Collection has grown over time, various new
	  categories have been introduced.  New categories can either
	  be <emphasis>virtual</emphasis> categories&mdash;those that
	  do not have a corresponding subdirectory in the ports
	  tree&mdash; or <emphasis>physical</emphasis>
	  categories&mdash;those that do.  The following text
	  discusses the issues involved in creating a new physical
	  category so that you can understand them before you propose
	  one.</para>

	<para>Our existing practice has been to avoid creating a new
	  physical category unless either a large number of ports
	  would logically belong to it, or the ports that would belong
	  to it are a logically distinct group that is of limited
	  general interest (for instance, categories related to spoken
	  human languages), or preferably both.</para>

	<para>The rationale for this is that such a change creates a
	  <link xlink:href="&url.articles.committers-guide;/#ports"> fair
	    amount of work</link> for both the committers and also
	  for all users who track changes to the Ports Collection.  In
	  addition, proposed category changes just naturally seem to
	  attract controversy.  (Perhaps this is because there is no
	  clear consensus on when a category is <quote>too
	    big</quote>, nor whether categories should lend themselves
	  to browsing (and thus what number of categories would be an
	  ideal number), and so forth.)</para>

	<para>Here is the procedure:</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>Propose the new category on &a.ports;.  You should
	      include a detailed rationale for the new category,
	      including why you feel the existing categories are not
	      sufficient, and the list of existing ports proposed to
	      move.  (If there are new ports pending in
	      <application>GNATS</application> that would fit this
	      category, list them too.)  If you are the maintainer
	      and/or submitter, respectively, mention that as it may
	      help you to make your case.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Participate in the discussion.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If it seems that there is support for your idea,
	      file a PR which includes both the rationale and the list
	      of existing ports that need to be moved.  Ideally, this
	      PR should also include patches for the following:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for the
		  new ports once they are repocopied</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  new category</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename> for the
		  old ports' categories</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para><filename>Makefile</filename>s for ports
		  that depend on the old ports</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>(for extra credit, you can include the other
		  files that have to change, as per the procedure
		  in the Committer's Guide.)</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Since it affects the ports infrastructure and
	      involves not only performing repo-copies but also
	      possibly running regression tests on the build cluster,
	      the PR should be assigned to the &a.portmgr;.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If that PR is approved, a committer will need to
	      follow the rest of the procedure that is <link xlink:href="&url.articles.committers-guide;/article.html#PORTS">
		outlined in the Committer's Guide</link>.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>Proposing a new virtual category should be similar to
	  the above but much less involved, since no ports will
	  actually have to move.  In this case, the only patches to
	  include in the PR would be those to add the new category to
	  the <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> of the affected
	  ports.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="proposing-reorg">
	<title>Proposing Reorganizing All the Categories</title>

	<para>Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the
	  categories with either a 2-level structure, or some other
	  kind of keyword structure.  To date, nothing has come of any
	  of these proposals because, while they are very easy to
	  make, the effort involved to retrofit the entire existing
	  ports collection with any kind of reorganization is daunting
	  to say the very least.  Please read the history of these
	  proposals in the mailing list archives before you post this
	  idea; furthermore, you should be prepared to be challenged
	  to offer a working prototype.</para>

      <title>The Distribution Files</title>

      <para>The second part of the <filename>Makefile</filename>
	describes the files that must be downloaded in order to build
	the port, and where they can be downloaded from.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>DISTVERSION/DISTNAME</varname></title>

	<para><varname>DISTNAME</varname> is the name of the port as
	  called by the authors of the software.
	  <varname>DISTNAME</varname> defaults to
	  <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>, so override
	  it only if necessary.  <varname>DISTNAME</varname> is only
	  used in two places.  First, the distribution file list
	  (<varname>DISTFILES</varname>) defaults to
	  <varname>${DISTNAME}</varname><varname>${EXTRACT_SUFX}</varname>.
	  Second, the distribution file is expected to extract into a
	  subdirectory named <varname>WRKSRC</varname>, which defaults
	  to
	  <filename>work/${DISTNAME}</filename>.</para>

	<para>Some vendor's distribution names which do not fit into
	  the <literal>${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}</literal>-scheme can
	  be handled automatically by setting
	  <varname>DISTVERSION</varname>.
	  <varname>PORTVERSION</varname> and

	<title><varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname></title>

	<para>If you have one distribution file, and it uses an odd
	  suffix to indicate the compression mechanism, set
	  <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>.</para>

	<para>For example, if the distribution file was named
	  <filename>foo.tgz</filename> instead of the more normal
	  <filename>foo.tar.gz</filename>, you would write:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTNAME=	foo
EXTRACT_SUFX=	.tgz</programlisting>

	<para>The <varname>USE_BZIP2</varname>,
	  <varname>USE_XZ</varname> and
	  <varname>USE_ZIP</varname> variables automatically set
	  <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname> to
	  <literal>.tar.bz2</literal>, <literal>.tar.xz</literal>
	  or <literal>.zip</literal> as necessary.  If neither of
	  these are set then <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname>
	  defaults to <literal>.tar.gz</literal>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>You never need to set both
	    <varname>EXTRACT_SUFX</varname> and
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname>.</para>
	</note>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>DISTFILES</varname></title>

	<para>Sometimes the names of the files to be downloaded have
	  no resemblance to the name of the port.  For example, it
	  might be called <filename>source.tar.gz</filename> or
	  similar.  In other cases the application's source code might
	  be in several different archives, all of which must be
	  downloaded.</para>

	<para>If this is the case, set <varname>DISTFILES</varname> to
	  be a space separated list of all the files that must be
	  downloaded.</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz source2.tar.gz</programlisting>

      <sect2 xml:id="porting-patchfiles">
	<title><varname>PATCHFILES</varname></title>

	<para>If your port requires some additional patches that are
	  available by FTP or HTTP, set <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>
	  to the names of the files and <varname>PATCH_SITES</varname>
	  to the URL of the directory that contains them (the format
	  is the same as <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>).</para>

	<para>If the patch is not relative to the top of the source
	  tree (i.e., <varname>WRKSRC</varname>) because it contains
	  some extra pathnames, set
	  <varname>PATCH_DIST_STRIP</varname> accordingly.  For
	  instance, if all the pathnames in the patch have an extra
	  <literal>foozolix-1.0/</literal> in front of the filenames,
	  then set <literal>PATCH_DIST_STRIP=-p1</literal>.</para>

	<para>Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be
	  decompressed automatically if the filenames end with
	  <filename>.gz</filename> or <filename>.Z</filename>.</para>

	<para>If the patch is distributed with some other files, such
	  as documentation, in a <command>gzip</command>ped tarball,
	  you cannot just use <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>.  If that
	  is the case, add the name and the location of the patch
	  tarball to <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  Then, use the
	  <varname>EXTRA_PATCHES</varname> variable to point to those
	  files and <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> will
	  automatically apply them for you.  In particular, do
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> copy patch files into the
	  <varname>PATCHDIR</varname> directory&mdash;that directory
	  may not be writable.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The tarball will have been extracted alongside the
	    regular source by then, so there is no need to explicitly
	    extract it if it is a regular <command>gzip</command>ped
	    or <command>compress</command>ed tarball.  If you do the
	    latter, take extra care not to overwrite something that
	    already exists in that directory.  Also, do not forget to
	    add a command to remove the copied patch in the
	    <buildtarget>pre-clean</buildtarget> target.</para>

	<title>Multiple Distribution Files or Patches from Different
	  Sites and Subdirectories
	  (<literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>)</title>

	<para>(Consider this to be a somewhat
	  <quote>advanced topic</quote>; those new to this document
	  may wish to skip this section at first).</para>

	<para>This section has information on the fetching mechanism
	  known as both <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> and
	  <literal>MASTER_SITES_NN</literal>.  We will refer to this
	  mechanism as <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>.</para>

	<para>A little background first.  OpenBSD has a neat feature
	  inside the <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	  <varname>PATCHFILES</varname> variables which allows files
	  and patches to be postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
	  identifiers.  Here, <literal>n</literal> can be both
	  <literal>[0-9]</literal> and denote a group designation.
	  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>DISTFILES=	alpha:0 beta:1</programlisting>

	<para>In OpenBSD, distribution file <filename>alpha</filename>
	  will be associated with variable
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES0</varname> instead of our common
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> and
	  <filename>beta</filename> with
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES1</varname>.</para>

	<para>This is a very interesting feature which can decrease
	  that endless search for the correct download site.</para>

	<para>Just picture 2 files in <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and
	  20 sites in <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, the sites slow
	  as hell where <filename>beta</filename> is carried by all
	  sites in <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, and
	  <filename>alpha</filename> can only be found in the 20th
	  site.  It would be such a waste to check all of them if the
	  maintainer knew this beforehand, would it not?  Not a good
	  start for that lovely weekend!</para>

	<para>Now that you have the idea, just imagine more
	  <varname>DISTFILES</varname> and more
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  Surely our
	  <quote>distfiles survey meister</quote> would appreciate the
	  relief to network strain that this would bring.</para>

	<para>In the next sections, information will follow on the
	  FreeBSD implementation of this idea.  We improved a bit on
	  OpenBSD's concept.</para>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Simplified Information</title>

	  <para>This section tells you how to quickly prepare fine
	    grained fetching of multiple distribution files and
	    patches from different sites and subdirectories.  We
	    describe here a case of simplified
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> usage.  This will be
	    sufficient for most scenarios.  However, if you need
	    further information, you will have to refer to the next
	    section.</para>

	  <para>Some applications consist of multiple distribution
	    files that must be downloaded from a number of different
	    sites.  For example,
	    <application>Ghostscript</application> consists of the
	    core of the program, and then a large number of driver
	    files that are used depending on the user's printer.  Some
	    of these driver files are supplied with the core, but many
	    others must be downloaded from a variety of different
	    sites.</para>

	  <para>To support this, each entry in
	    <varname>DISTFILES</varname> may be followed by a colon
	    and a <quote>tag name</quote>.  Each site listed in
	    <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> is then followed by a
	    colon, and the tag that indicates which distribution files
	    should be downloaded from this site.</para>

	  <para>For example, consider an application with the source
	    split in two parts, <filename>source1.tar.gz</filename>
	    and <filename>source2.tar.gz</filename>, which must be
	    downloaded from two different sites.  The port's
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would include lines like
	    <xref linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site"/>.</para>

	  <example xml:id="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-one-file-per-site">
	    <title>Simplified Use of <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal>
	      with One File Per Site</title>

		ftp://ftp.example2.com/:source2
DISTFILES=	source1.tar.gz:source1 \
		source2.tar.gz:source2</programlisting>
	  </example>

	  <para>Multiple distribution files can have the same tag.
	    Continuing the previous example, suppose that there was a
	    third distfile, <filename>source3.tar.gz</filename>, that
	    should be downloaded from
	    <systemitem>ftp.example2.com</systemitem>.  The
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> would then be written like
	    <xref linkend="ports-master-sites-n-example-simple-use-more-than-one-file-per-site"/>.</para>

	  <title>Detailed Information</title>

	  <para>Okay, so the previous section example did not reflect
	    your needs?  In this section we will explain in detail
	    how the fine grained fetching mechanism
	    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> works and how you can
	    modify your ports to use it.</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements can be postfixed with
		<literal>:n</literal> where
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> is
		<literal>[^:,]+</literal>, i.e.,
		<replaceable>n</replaceable> could conceptually be any
		alphanumeric string but we will limit it to
		<literal>[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]+</literal> for
		now.</para>

	      <para>Moreover, string matching is case sensitive;
		i.e., <literal>n</literal> is different from
		<literal>N</literal>.</para>

	      <para>However, the following words cannot be used for
		postfixing purposes since they yield special meaning:
		<literal>default</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and
		<literal>ALL</literal> (they are used internally in
		item <xref linkend="porting-master-sites-n-what-changes-in-port-targets"/>).
		Furthermore, <literal>DEFAULT</literal> is a special
		purpose word (check item <xref linkend="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group"/>).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Elements postfixed with <literal>:n</literal>
		belong to the group <literal>n</literal>,
		<literal>:m</literal> belong to group
		<literal>m</literal> and so forth.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem xml:id="porting-master-sites-n-DEFAULT-group">
	      <para>Elements without a postfix are groupless, i.e.,
		they all belong to the special group
		<literal>DEFAULT</literal>.  If you postfix any
		elements with <literal>DEFAULT</literal>, you are just
		being redundant unless you want to have an element
		belonging to both <literal>DEFAULT</literal> and other
		groups at the same time (check item <xref linkend="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator"/>).</para>

	      <para>The following examples are equivalent but the
		first one is preferred:</para>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Groups are not exclusive, an element may belong to
		several different groups at the same time and a group
		can either have either several different elements or
		none at all.  Repeated elements within the same group
		will be simply that, repeated elements.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem xml:id="porting-master-sites-n-comma-operator">
	      <para>When you want an element to belong to several
		groups at the same time, you can use the comma
		operator (<literal>,</literal>).</para>

	      <para>Instead of repeating it several times, each time
		with a different postfix, we can list several groups
		at once in a single postfix.  For instance,
		<literal>:m,n,o</literal> marks an element that
		belongs to group <literal>m</literal>,
		<literal>n</literal> and <literal>o</literal>.</para>

	      <para>All the following examples are equivalent but the

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT alpha:SOME_SITE</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:SOME_SITE,DEFAULT</programlisting>

	      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=	alpha:DEFAULT,SOME_SITE</programlisting>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>All sites within a given group are sorted

		    <varname>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</varname> elements must
		    be terminated with the forward slash
		    <literal>/</literal> character.  If any elements
		    belong to any groups, the group postfix
		    <literal>:n</literal>
		    must come right after the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal>.  The
		    <literal>MASTER_SITES:n</literal> mechanism relies
		    on the existence of the terminator
		    <literal>/</literal> to avoid confusing elements
		    where a <literal>:n</literal> is a valid part of
		    the element with occurrences where
		    <literal>:n</literal> denotes group
		    <literal>n</literal>.  For compatibility purposes,

		    <varname>PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR</varname> elements, if
		    the postfix immediate preceding character is not
		    a <literal>/</literal> then <literal>:n</literal>
		    will be considered a valid part of the element
		    instead of a group postfix even if an element is

	  &os; build cluster to keep a copy of the files specified in

	  generally not need these files, so it is a good idea to only
	  add the source distfiles to <varname>DISTFILES</varname>

      <para>Many ports depend on other ports.  This is a very
	convenient feature of most Unix-like operating systems,
	including &os;.  Multiple ports can share a common dependency,
	rather than bundling that dependency with every port or
	package that needs it.  There are seven variables that can be
	used to ensure that all the required bits will be on the
	user's machine.  There are also some pre-supported dependency
	variables for common cases, plus a few more to control the
	behavior of dependencies.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>LIB_DEPENDS</varname></title>

	<para>This variable specifies the shared libraries this port
	  depends on.  It is a list of
	  <replaceable>lib</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable>
	  tuples where <replaceable>lib</replaceable> is the name of
	  the shared library, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the
	  directory in which to find it in case it is not available.
	  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>LIB_DEPENDS=   libjpeg.so:${PORTSDIR}/graphics/jpeg</programlisting>

	<para>will check for a shared jpeg library with any version,
	  and descend into the <filename>graphics/jpeg</filename>
	  subdirectory of your ports tree to build and install it if
	  it is not found.</para>

	<para>The dependency is checked twice, once from within the
	  <buildtarget>build</buildtarget> target and then from within
	  the <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target.  Also, the name
	  of the dependency is put into the package so that
	  &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically install it if it is not
	  on the user's system.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  depends on during run-time.  It is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional>:target</optional>
	  tuples where <replaceable>path</replaceable> is the name of
	  the executable or file, <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is
	  the directory in which to find it in case it is not
	  available, and <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the
	  target to call in that directory.  If
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable> starts with a slash
	  (<literal>/</literal>), it is treated as a file and its
	  existence is tested with <command>test -e</command>;
	  otherwise, it is assumed to be an executable, and
	  <command>which -s</command> is used to determine if the
	  program exists in the search path.</para>

	<para>For example,</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${LOCALBASE}/news/bin/innd:${PORTSDIR}/news/inn \
		xmlcatmgr:${PORTSDIR}/textproc/xmlcatmgr</programlisting>

	<para>will check if the file or directory
	  <filename>/usr/local/news/bin/innd</filename> exists, and
	  build and install it from the <filename>news/inn</filename>
	  subdirectory of the ports tree if it is not found.  It will
	  also see if an executable called
	  <command>xmlcatmgr</command> is in the search path, and
	  descend into the <filename>textproc/xmlcatmgr</filename>
	  subdirectory of your ports tree to build and install it if
	  it is not found.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>In this case, <command>innd</command> is actually an
	    executable; if an executable is in a place that is not
	    expected to be in the search path, you should use the full
	    pathname.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>The official search <envar>PATH</envar> used on the
	    ports build cluster is</para>

	  <programlisting>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin</programlisting>
	</note>

	<para>The dependency is checked from within the
	  <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target.  Also, the name of
	  the dependency is put into the package so that
	  &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically install it if it is not
	  on the user's system.  The <replaceable>target</replaceable>
	  part can be omitted if it is the same as
	  <varname>DEPENDS_TARGET</varname>.</para>

	<para>A quite common situation is when
	  <varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname> is literally the same as
	  <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>, especially if ported
	  software is written in a scripted language or if it requires
	  the same build and run-time environment.  In this
	  case, it is both tempting and intuitive to directly
	  assign one to the other:</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS=	${BUILD_DEPENDS}</programlisting>

	<para>However, such assignment can pollute run-time
	  dependencies with entries not defined in the port's original
	  <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.  This happens because of
	  &man.make.1;'s lazy evaluation of variable assignment.
	  Consider a <filename>Makefile</filename> with
	  <varname>USE_<replaceable>*</replaceable></varname>
	  variables, which are processed by
	  <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.*.mk</filename> to augment initial
	  build dependencies.  For example,
	  <literal>USES= gmake</literal> adds
	  <package>devel/gmake</package> to
	  <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname>.  To prevent such
	  additional dependencies from polluting
	  <varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname>, take care to assign with
	  expansion, i.e., expand the value before assigning it to the
	  variable:</para>

	<programlisting>RUN_DEPENDS:=	${BUILD_DEPENDS}</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  requires to build.  Like <varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname>, it
	  is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional>:target</optional>
	  tuples.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>BUILD_DEPENDS=	unzip:${PORTSDIR}/archivers/unzip</programlisting>

	<para>will check for an executable called
	  <command>unzip</command>, and descend into the
	  <filename>archivers/unzip</filename> subdirectory of your
	  ports tree to build and install it if it is not
	  found.</para>

	<note>
	  <para><quote>build</quote> here means everything from
	    extraction to compilation.  The dependency is checked from
	    within the <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget> target.  The
	    <replaceable>target</replaceable> part can be omitted if
	    it is the same as <varname>DEPENDS_TARGET</varname></para>
	</note>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>FETCH_DEPENDS</varname></title>

	<para>This variable specifies executables or files this port
	  requires to fetch.  Like the previous two, it is a list of
	  <replaceable>path</replaceable>:<replaceable>dir</replaceable><optional>:target</optional>
	  tuples.  For example,</para>

	<programlisting>FETCH_DEPENDS=	ncftp2:${PORTSDIR}/net/ncftp2</programlisting>

	<para>will check for an executable called
	  <command>ncftp2</command>, and descend into the
	  <filename>net/ncftp2</filename> subdirectory of your ports
	  tree to build and install it if it is not found.</para>

	<para>The dependency is checked from within the

	<title>Notes on Dependencies</title>

	<para>As mentioned above, the default target to call when a
	  dependency is required is
	  <buildtarget>DEPENDS_TARGET</buildtarget>.  It defaults to
	  <literal>install</literal>.  This is a user variable; it is
	  never defined in a port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  If
	  your port needs a special way to handle a dependency, use
	  the <literal>:target</literal> part of the
	  <varname>*_DEPENDS</varname> variables instead of redefining
	  <varname>DEPENDS_TARGET</varname>.</para>

	<para>When you type <command>make clean</command>, its
	  dependencies are automatically cleaned too.  If you do not
	  wish this to happen, define the variable
	  <varname>NOCLEANDEPENDS</varname> in your environment.  This
	  may be particularly desirable if the port has something that
	  takes a long time to rebuild in its dependency list, such as
	  KDE, GNOME or Mozilla.</para>

	<para>To depend on another port unconditionally, use the
	  variable <varname>${NONEXISTENT}</varname> as the first
	  field of <varname>BUILD_DEPENDS</varname> or
	  <varname>RUN_DEPENDS</varname>.  Use this only when you need

	</important>

	<para>The ports building technology does not tolerate circular
	  dependencies.  If you introduce one, you will have someone,
	  somewhere in the world, whose FreeBSD installation will
	  break almost immediately, with many others quickly to
	  follow.  These can really be hard to detect; if in doubt,
	  before you make that change, make sure you have done the
	  following: <command>cd /usr/ports; make index</command>.
	  That process can be quite slow on older machines, but you
	  may be able to save a large number of people&mdash;including
	  yourself&mdash; a lot of grief in the process.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>Problems Caused by Automatic Dependencies</title>

	<para>Dependencies must be declared either explicitly or by
	  using the <link linkend="makefile-options">OPTIONS framework</link>.
	  Using other methods like automatic detection complicates
	  indexing, which causes problems for port and package
	  management.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Wrong Declaration of an Optional Dependency</title>

	  <programlisting>.include &lt;bsd.port.pre.mk&gt;

.if exists(${LOCALBASE}/bin/foo)
LIB_DEPENDS=	libbar.so:${PORTSDIR}/foo/bar
.endif</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>The problem with trying to automatically add
	  dependencies is that files and settings outside an
	  individual port can change at any time.  For example: an
	  index is built, then a batch of ports are installed.  But
	  one of the ports installs the tested file.  The index is now
	  incorrect, because an installed port unexpectedly has a new
	  dependency.  The index may still be wrong even after
	  rebuilding if other ports also determine their need for
	  dependencies based on the existence of other files.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Correct Declaration of an Optional Dependency</title>

	  <programlisting>OPTIONS_DEFINE=	BAR
BAR_DESC=	Bar support

.include &lt;bsd.port.options.mk&gt;

.if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MBAR}
LIB_DEPENDS=	libbar.so:${PORTSDIR}/foo/bar
.endif</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Testing option variables is the correct method.  It will
	  not cause inconsistencies in the index of a batch of ports,
	  provided the options were defined prior to the index build.
	  Simple scripts can then be used to automate the building,
	  installation, and updating of these ports and their
	  packages.</para>

	<title><varname>USE_</varname> and

	<para>For more control over dependencies in some cases,

    <sect1 xml:id="makefile-masterdir">
      <title><varname>MASTERDIR</varname></title>

      <para>If your port needs to build slightly different versions of
	packages by having a variable (for instance, resolution, or
	paper size) take different values, create one subdirectory per
	package to make it easier for users to see what to do, but try
	to share as many files as possible between ports.  Typically
	you only need a very short <filename>Makefile</filename> in
	all but one of the directories if you use variables cleverly.
	In the sole <filename>Makefile</filename>, you can use
	<varname>MASTERDIR</varname> to specify the directory where
	the rest of the files are.  Also, use a variable as part of
	<link linkend="porting-pkgname"><varname>PKGNAMESUFFIX</varname></link>
	so the packages will have different names.</para>

      <para>This will be best demonstrated by an example.  This is

      <programlisting>PORTNAME=	xdvi

      <para><package>japanese/xdvi300</package> also
	has all the regular patches, package files, etc.  If you type
	<command>make</command> there, it will take the default value
	for the resolution (300) and build the port normally.</para>

      <para>As for other resolutions, this is the

	<filename>xdvi118/Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>RESOLUTION=	118

      <para>(<filename>xdvi240/Makefile</filename> and
	<filename>xdvi400/Makefile</filename> are similar).  The
	<varname>MASTERDIR</varname> definition tells

	subdirectories like <varname>FILESDIR</varname> and
	<varname>SCRIPTDIR</varname> are to be found under

	that the files corresponding to manual pages should be placed in
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> along with the rest of the files.
	The purpose of <varname>MANDIRS</varname> is to enable automatic

    <sect1 xml:id="makefile-info">

      <para>If your package needs to install GNU info files, they

	<filename>PREFIX/INFO_PATH</filename>.
	You can change <varname>INFO_PATH</varname> if your package
	uses a different location.  However, this is not recommended.
	These entries contain just the path relative to

	For example, <package>lang/gcc34</package>

	<para>In the example above, imagine a library libfoo is
	  installed on the system.  The user does not want this
	  application to use libfoo, so he toggled the option off in
	  the <literal>make config</literal> dialog.  But the
	  application's configure script detects the library present
	  in the system and includes its support in the resulting

	  the system, the ports system does not protest (no dependency
	  on libfoo was recorded) but the application breaks.</para>

	  <varname>COPYTREE_BIN</varname>, will set all the installed
	  files to be executable, thus being suitable for installing
	  into <filename>PREFIX/bin</filename>.
	  The second macro, <varname>COPYTREE_SHARE</varname>, does
	  not set executable permissions on files, and is therefore
	  suitable for installing files under

	  target.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <literal>DOCS</literal> option only controls
	    additional documentation installed in

	    <literal>DATA</literal> and <literal>EXAMPLES</literal>
	    options, respectively.</para>
	</note>

	<para>These variables are exported to
	  <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname>.  Their values will appear
	  there as pathnames relative to
	  <filename>PREFIX</filename> if possible.
	  That is,
	  <filename>share/doc/PORTNAME</filename>
	  will be substituted for <literal>%%DOCSDIR%%</literal> in
	  the packing list by default, and so on.  (See more on
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> substitution
	  <link linkend="plist-sub">here</link>.)</para>

	<para>All conditionally installed documentation files and
	  directories should be included in

	<programlisting>%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/AUTHORS
%%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT
%%PORTDOCS%%@dirrm %%DOCSDIR%%</programlisting>

	<para>As an alternative to enumerating the documentation files
	  in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>, a port can set the
	  variable <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> to a list of file names
	  and shell glob patterns to add to the final packing list.
	  The names will be relative to <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>.
	  Therefore, a port that utilizes <varname>PORTDOCS</varname>
	  and uses a non-default location for its documentation should
	  set <varname>DOCSDIR</varname> accordingly.  If a directory
	  is listed in <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> or matched by a
	  glob pattern from this variable, the entire subtree of
	  contained files and directories will be registered in the

	  has been unset then files and directories listed in
	  <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> would not be installed or added
	  to port packing list.  Installing the documentation at
	  <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> as shown above remains up to the
	  port itself.  A typical example of utilizing
	  <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> looks as follows:</para>

	<programlisting>PORTDOCS=	README.* ChangeLog docs/*</programlisting>

	<note>
	  <para>The equivalents of <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> for

	  <para>You can also use the <filename>pkg-message</filename>
	    file to display messages upon installation.  See
	    <link linkend="porting-message">the section on using

  <chapter xml:id="special">
    <title>Special Considerations</title>

    <para>There are some more things you have to take into account
      when you create a port.  This section explains the most common
      of those.</para>

    <sect1 xml:id="staging">
      <title>Staging</title>

      <para><filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> expects ports to work with
	a <quote>stage directory</quote>.  This means that a
	port should not install files directly to the regular
	destination directories (that is, under
	<varname>PREFIX</varname>, for example) but instead into a
	separate directory from which the package is then built.  In
	many cases, this does not require root privileges, making it
	possible to build packages as an unprivileged user.  With
	staging, the port is built and installed into the stage
	directory, <varname>STAGEDIR</varname>.  A package is created
	from the stage directory and then installed on the system.  Automake tools refer to
	this concept as <varname>DESTDIR</varname>, but in &os;,
	<varname>DESTDIR</varname> has a different meaning (see <xref linkend="porting-prefix"/>).</para>

      <para>When a port still requires system-wide privileges in order
	to run the <buildtarget>package</buildtarget> target, this
	line must be added to the
	<filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>NEED_ROOT=	yes</programlisting>

      <para>Meta ports, or ports that do not install files themselves
	but only depend on other ports, should avoid
	needlessly extracting the &man.mtree.8; to the stage directory.
	This is the basic directory layout
	of the package, and these empty directories will be seens as
	orphans.  To prevent &man.mtree.8; extraction, add this line:</para>

      <programlisting>NO_MTREE=	yes</programlisting>

      <para>Staging is enabled by prepending the
	<varname>STAGEDIR</varname> variable to paths used in
	the <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget>,
	<buildtarget>do-install</buildtarget>, and
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> targets (see the examples
	through the book).  Typically, this includes
	<varname>PREFIX</varname>, <varname>ETCDIR</varname>,
	<varname>DATADIR</varname>, <varname>EXAMPLESDIR</varname>,
	<varname>MANPREFIX</varname>, <varname>DOCSDIR</varname>, and so on.
	Directories should be created as part of the
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target.  Avoid using
	absolute paths whenever possible.</para>

      <para>When creating a symlink, <varname>STAGEDIR</varname> should
	be prepended to the target path only.  For example:</para>

      <programlisting>${LN} -sf libfoo.so.42 ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/libfoo.so</programlisting>

      <para>The source path
	<filename>${PREFIX}/lib/libfoo.so.42</filename> looks
	fine but could, in fact, be incorrect.  Absolute paths can
	point to a wrong location, like when a remote
	file system has been mounted with <acronym>NFS</acronym> under a non-root mount point.
	Relative paths are less fragile, and often much shorter.</para>

      <para>Ports that install kernel modules must prepend the
	<varname>STAGEDIR</varname> variable to
	their destination, by default
	<filename>/boot/modules</filename>.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="porting-shlibs">
      <title>Shared Libraries</title>

      <para>If your port installs one or more shared libraries, define
	a <varname>USE_LDCONFIG</varname> make variable, which will
	instruct a <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> to run
	<literal>&dollar;{LDCONFIG} -m</literal> on the directory
	where the new library is installed (usually
	<filename>PREFIX/lib</filename>) during
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> target to register it
	into the shared library cache.  This variable, when defined,
	will also facilitate addition of an appropriate
	<literal>@exec /sbin/ldconfig -m</literal> and
	<literal>@unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R</literal> pair into your
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> file, so that a user who
	installed the package can start using the shared library
	immediately and de-installation will not cause the system to
	still believe the library is there.</para>

      <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	yes</programlisting>

      <para>If you need, you can override the default directory by
	setting the <varname>USE_LDCONFIG</varname> value to a list of
	directories into which shared libraries are to be installed.
	For example if your port installs shared libraries into
	<filename>PREFIX/lib/foo</filename> and
	<filename>PREFIX/lib/bar</filename>
	directories you could use the following in your
	<filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_LDCONFIG=	${PREFIX}/lib/foo ${PREFIX}/lib/bar</programlisting>

      <para>Please double-check, often this is not necessary at all or
	can be avoided through <literal>-rpath</literal> or setting
	<envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar> during linking (see
	<package>lang/moscow_ml</package> for an
	example), or through a shell-wrapper which sets
	<varname>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</varname> before invoking the binary,
	like <package>www/seamonkey</package>
	does.</para>

      <para>When installing 32-bit libraries on 64-bit system, use
	<varname>USE_LDCONFIG32</varname> instead.</para>

      <para>Try to keep shared library version numbers in the
	<filename>libfoo.so.0</filename> format.  Our runtime linker
	only cares for the major (first) number.</para>

      <para>When the major library version number increments in the
	update to the new port version, all other ports that link to
	the affected library should have their
	<varname>PORTREVISION</varname> incremented, to force
	recompilation with the new library version.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="porting-restrictions">
      <title>Ports with Distribution Restrictions</title>

      <para>Licenses vary, and some of them place restrictions on how
	the application can be packaged, whether it can be sold for
	profit, and so on.</para>

      <important>
	<para>It is your responsibility as a porter to read the
	  licensing terms of the software and make sure that the
	  FreeBSD project will not be held accountable for violating
	  them by redistributing the source or compiled binaries
	  either via FTP/HTTP or CD-ROM.  If in doubt, please contact
	  the &a.ports;.</para>
      </important>

      <para>In situations like this, the variables described in the
	following sections can be set.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname></title>

	<para>This variable indicates that we may not generate a
	  binary package of the application.  For instance, the
	  license may disallow binary redistribution, or it may
	  prohibit distribution of packages created from patched
	  sources.</para>

	<para>However, the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname> may be
	  freely mirrored on FTP/HTTP.  They may also be distributed
	  on a CD-ROM (or similar media) unless
	  <varname>NO_CDROM</varname> is set as well.</para>

	<para><varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname> should also be used if the
	  binary package is not generally useful, and the application
	  should always be compiled from the source code.  For
	  example, if the application has configuration information
	  that is site specific hard coded in to it at compile time,
	  set <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>.</para>

	<para><varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the package should not be
	  generated.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>NO_CDROM</varname></title>

	<para>This variable alone indicates that, although we are
	  allowed to generate binary packages, we may put neither
	  those packages nor the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname>
	  onto a CD-ROM (or similar media) for resale.  However, the
	  binary packages and the port's <varname>DISTFILES</varname>
	  will still be available via FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para> If this variable is set along with
	  <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname>, then only the port's
	  <varname>DISTFILES</varname> will be available, and only via
	  FTP/HTTP.</para>

	<para><varname>NO_CDROM</varname> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed
	  on CD-ROM.  For instance, this should be used if the port's
	  license is for <quote>non-commercial</quote> use
	  only.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>NOFETCHFILES</varname></title>

	<para>Files defined in the <varname>NOFETCHFILES</varname>
	  variable are not fetchable from any of the
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  An example of such a file
	  is when the file is supplied on CD-ROM by the vendor.</para>

	<para>Tools which check for the availability of these files
	  on the <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> should ignore these
	  files and not report about them.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>RESTRICTED</varname></title>

	<para>Set this variable alone if the application's license
	  permits neither mirroring the application's
	  <varname>DISTFILES</varname> nor distributing the binary
	  package in any way.</para>

	<para><varname>NO_CDROM</varname> or
	  <varname>NO_PACKAGE</varname> should not be set along with
	  <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> since the latter variable
	  implies the former ones.</para>

	<para><varname>RESTRICTED</varname> should be set to a string
	  describing the reason why the port cannot be redistributed.
	  Typically, this indicates that the port contains proprietary
	  software and that the user will need to manually download
	  the <varname>DISTFILES</varname>, possibly after registering
	  for the software or agreeing to accept the terms of an
	  <acronym>EULA</acronym>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title><varname>RESTRICTED_FILES</varname></title>

	<para>When <varname>RESTRICTED</varname> or
	  <varname>NO_CDROM</varname> is set, this variable defaults
	  to <literal>${DISTFILES} ${PATCHFILES}</literal>, otherwise
	  it is empty.  If only some of the distribution files are
	  restricted, then set this variable to list them.</para>

	<para>Note that the port committer should add an entry to
	  <filename>/usr/ports/LEGAL</filename> for every listed
	  distribution file, describing exactly what the restriction
	  entails.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Examples</title>

	<para>The preferred way to state "the distfiles for this port
	  must be fetched manually" is as follows:</para>

	<programlisting>.if !exists(${DISTDIR}/${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX})
IGNORE=	may not be redistributed because of licensing reasons. Please visit <replaceable>some-website</replaceable> to accept their license and download ${DISTFILES} into ${DISTDIR}
.endif</programlisting>

	<para>This both informs the user, and sets the proper metadata
	  on the user's machine for use by automated programs.</para>

	<title>Building Ports in Parallel</title>

	<para>The &os; ports framework supports parallel building
	  using multiple <command>make</command> sub-processes, which

	<para>The various GNU autotools provide an abstraction

	  Within the Ports Collection, an individual port can make use

	  or <literal>aclocal</literal>.</para>

	<para><replaceable>version</replaceable> specifies the

	<para>Multiple tools can be specified at once, either by
	  including them all on a single line, or using the
	  <literal>+=</literal> Makefile construct.</para>

	<para>Finally, there is the special tool, called
	  <literal>autotools</literal>, which is a convenience
	  function to bring in all available versions of the autotools
	  to allow for cross-development work.  This can also be

      <sect2 xml:id="using-libtool">

	<para>Shared libraries using the GNU building framework
	  usually use <command>libtool</command> to adjust the

	  practice is to use copy of <command>libtool</command>
	  bundled with the application.  In case you need to use
	  external <command>libtool</command>, you can use the version
	  provided by The Ports Collection:</para>

	<programlisting>USE_AUTOTOOLS=	libtool:<replaceable>version</replaceable>[:env]</programlisting>

	<para>With no additional operations,
	  <literal>libtool:version</literal>
	  tells the building framework to patch the configure script
	  with the system-installed copy of
	  <command>libtool</command>.  The
	  <varname>GNU_CONFIGURE</varname> is implied.  Further, a
	  number of make and shell variables will be assigned for
	  onward use by the port.  See
	  <filename>bsd.autotools.mk</filename> for details.</para>

	<para>With the <literal>:env</literal> operation, only the

	<para>Finally, <varname>LIBTOOLFLAGS</varname> and

	<title>Basic Usage</title>

	<para>If your port requires <literal>gettext</literal>, set
	  <literal>USES= gettext</literal>, and your port will inherit
	  a dependency on
	  <package>devel/gettext</package>.  Other
	  values for <literal>gettext</literal> usage are listed in
	  <xref linkend="uses-values"/>.</para>

	<para>A rather common case is a port using
	  <literal>gettext</literal> and <command>configure</command>.
	  Generally, GNU <command>configure</command> should be able
	  to locate <literal>gettext</literal> automatically.  If it
	  ever fails to, hints at the location of
	  <literal>gettext</literal> can be passed in
	  <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> and <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>USES=	gettext
CPPFLAGS+=	-I${LOCALBASE}/include
LDFLAGS+=	-L${LOCALBASE}/lib

GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes</programlisting>

	<para>Of course, the code can be more compact if there are no
	  more flags to pass to <command>configure</command>:</para>

	<programlisting>USES=	gettext
GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Optional Usage</title>

	<para>Some software products allow for disabling NLS, e.g.,
	  through passing <option>--disable-nls</option> to
	  <command>configure</command>.  In that case, your port
	  should use <literal>gettext</literal> conditionally,
	  depending on the status of the <varname>NLS</varname>
	  option.  For ports of low to medium complexity, you can rely
	  on the following idiom:</para>

	<programlisting>GNU_CONFIGURE=		yes

.include &lt;bsd.port.options.mk&gt;

.if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MNLS}
USES+=			gettext
PLIST_SUB+=		NLS=""
.else
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-nls
PLIST_SUB+=		NLS="@comment "
.endif

.include &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>The next item on your to-do list is to arrange so that
	  the message catalog files are included in the packing list
	  conditionally.  The <filename>Makefile</filename> part of
	  this task is already provided by the idiom.  It is explained
	  in the section on <link linkend="plist-sub">advanced
	    <filename>pkg-plist</filename> practices</link>.  In a
	  nutshell, each occurrence of <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> will be replaced by
	  <quote><literal>@comment&nbsp;</literal></quote> if NLS is
	  disabled, or by a null string if NLS is enabled.
	  Consequently, the lines prefixed by
	  <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> will become mere comments in the
	  final packing list if NLS is off; otherwise the prefix will
	  be just left out.  All you need to do now is insert
	  <literal>%%NLS%%</literal> before each path to a message
	  catalog file in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  For
	  example:</para>

	<programlisting>%%NLS%%share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo
%%NLS%%share/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo</programlisting>

	<para>In high complexity cases, you may need to use more
	  advanced techniques than the recipe given here, such as
	  <link linkend="plist-dynamic">dynamic packing list
	    generation</link>.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>Handling Message Catalog Directories</title>

	<para>There is a point to note about installing message
	  catalog files.  The target directories for them, which
	  reside under
	  <filename>LOCALBASE/share/locale</filename>,
	  should rarely be created and removed by a port.  The most
	  popular languages have their respective directories listed
	  in
	  <filename>PORTSDIR/Templates/BSD.local.dist</filename>.
	  The directories for many other languages are governed by the
	  <package>devel/gettext</package> port.
	  Consult its <filename>pkg-plist</filename> and see whether
	  the port is going to install a message catalog file for a

	<para>When the port is to be built using Apache Ant, it has to
	  define <varname>USE_ANT</varname>.  Ant is thus considered
	  to be the sub-make command.  When no
	  <literal>do-build</literal> target is defined by the port, a

	  and <varname>ALL_TARGET</varname>.  This is similar to the
	  <varname>USES= gmake</varname> mechanism, which is
	  documented in <xref linkend="building"/>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="java-best-practices">
	<title>Best Practices</title>

	<para>When porting a Java library, your port should install
	  the JAR file(s) in <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>, and
	  everything else under
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> (except for
	  the documentation, see below).  In order to reduce the
	  packing file size, you may reference the JAR file(s)
	  directly in the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Just use the
	  following statement (where <filename>myport.jar</filename>
	  is the name of the JAR file installed as part of the
	  port):</para>

	<programlisting>PLIST_FILES+=	%%JAVAJARDIR%%/myport.jar</programlisting>

	<para>When porting a Java application, the port usually
	  installs everything under a single directory (including its
	  JAR dependencies).  The use of
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> is strongly
	  encouraged in this regard.  It is up the porter to decide
	  whether the port should install the additional JAR
	  dependencies under this directory or directly use the
	  already installed ones (from
	  <filename>${JAVAJARDIR}</filename>).</para>

	<para>Regardless of the type of your port (library or
	  application), the additional documentation should be
	  installed in the
	  <link linkend="install-documentation">same location</link>
	  as for any other port.  The JavaDoc tool is known to produce
	  a different set of files depending on the version of the JDK
	  that is used.  For ports that do not enforce the use of a
	  particular JDK, it is therefore a complex task to specify
	  the packing list (<filename>pkg-plist</filename>).  This is
	  one reason why porters are strongly encouraged to use the
	  <varname>PORTDOCS</varname> macro.  Moreover, even if you
	  can predict the set of files that will be generated by
	  <command>javadoc</command>, the size of the resulting
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename> advocates for the use of
	  <varname>PORTDOCS</varname>.</para>

	<para>The default value for <varname>DATADIR</varname> is
	  <filename>${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}</filename>.  It is a
	  good idea to override <varname>DATADIR</varname> to
	  <filename>${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}</filename> for Java
	  ports.  Indeed, <varname>DATADIR</varname> is automatically
	  added to <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname> (documented in
	  <xref linkend="plist-sub"/>) so you may use
	  <literal>%%DATADIR%%</literal> directly in
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

	<para>As for the choice of building Java ports from source or
	  directly installing them from a binary distribution, there
	  is no defined policy at the time of writing.  However,
	  people from the
	  <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsd.org/java/">&os; Java
	    Project</link> encourage porters to have their ports
	  built from source whenever it is a trivial task.</para>

	<para>All the features that have been presented in this
	  section are implemented in <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.
	  If you ever think that your port needs more sophisticated
	  Java support, please first have a look at the <link xlink:href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.java.mk?view=markup">bsd.java.mk
	    SVN log</link> as it usually takes some time
	  to document the latest features.  Then, if you think the
	  support you are lacking would be beneficial to many other
	  Java ports, feel free to discuss it on the &a.java;.</para>

	<para>Although there is a <literal>java</literal> category for
	  PRs, it refers to the JDK porting effort from the &os; Java
	  project.  Therefore, you should submit your Java port in the
	  <literal>ports</literal> category as for any other port,
	  unless the issue you are trying to resolve is related to
	  either a JDK implementation or
	  <filename>bsd.java.mk</filename>.</para>

	<para>Similarly, there is a defined policy regarding the
	  <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> of a Java port, which is
	  detailed in <xref linkend="makefile-categories"/>.</para>

	  differently for every available version.  Majority of

      <title>Starting and Stopping Services (<literal>rc</literal>

      <para><filename>rc.d</filename> scripts are used to start

	standard way of stopping, starting and restarting the service.
	Ports integrate into the system <filename>rc.d</filename>
	framework.  Details on its usage can be found in <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/configtuning-rcd.html">the rc.d
	  Handbook chapter</link>.  Detailed explanation of available
	commands is provided in &man.rc.8; and &man.rc.subr.8;.
	Finally, there is <link xlink:href="&url.articles.rc-scripting;">an
	  article</link> on practical aspects of
	<filename>rc.d</filename> scripting.</para>

      <para>One or more <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts can be
	installed:</para>

      <programlisting>USE_RC_SUBR=	doormand</programlisting>

      <para>Scripts must be placed in the <filename>files</filename>
	subdirectory and a <literal>.in</literal> suffix must be added
	to their filename.  Standard <varname>SUB_LIST</varname>
	expansions will be used for this file.  Use of the
	<literal>%%PREFIX%%</literal> and
	<literal>%%LOCALBASE%%</literal> expansions is strongly
	encouraged as well.  More on <varname>SUB_LIST</varname> in
	<link linkend="using-sub-files">the relevant
	  section</link>.</para>

      <para>Prior to &os;&nbsp;6.1-RELEASE, integration with
	&man.rcorder.8; is available by using
	<varname>USE_RCORDER</varname> instead of
	<varname>USE_RC_SUBR</varname>.  However, use of this method
	is not necessary unless the port has an option to install
	itself in the base, or the service needs to run prior to the
	<filename>FILESYSTEMS</filename> <filename>rc.d</filename>
	script in the base.</para>

      <para>As of &os;&nbsp;6.1-RELEASE, local
	<filename>rc.d</filename> scripts (including those installed
	by ports) are included in the overall &man.rcorder.8; of the

#
# Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf

# doormand_enable (bool):	Set to NO by default.
#				Set it to YES to enable doormand.
# doormand_config (path):	Set to %%PREFIX%%/etc/doormand/doormand.cf

      <para> Unless there is a good reason to start the service

      <programlisting>REQUIRE: LOGIN</programlisting>

      <para>If the service runs as a particular user (other than root)
	this is mandatory.</para>

      <programlisting>KEYWORD: shutdown</programlisting>

      <para>is included in the script above because the mythical port
	we are using as an example starts a service, and should be
	shut down cleanly when the system shuts down.  If the script
	is not starting a persistent service this is not
	necessary.</para>

      <para>For optional configuration elements the &quot;=&quot;
	style of default variable assignment is preferable to the
	&quot;:=&quot; style here, since the former sets a default
	value only if the variable is unset, and the latter sets one
	if the variable is unset <emphasis>or</emphasis> null.  A user
	might very well include something like</para>

      <programlisting>doormand_flags=""</programlisting>

      <para>in their <filename>rc.conf.local</filename> file, and a
	variable substitution using &quot;:=&quot; would
	inappropriately override the user's intention.  The
	<literal>_enable</literal> variable is not optional,
	and should use the &quot;:&quot; for the default.</para>

	<title>Pre-Commit Checklist</title>

	<para>Before contributing a port with an
	  <filename>rc.d</filename> script, and more importantly,
	  before committing one, please consult the following
	  checklist to be sure that it is ready.</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>If this is a new file, does it have
	      <filename>.sh</filename> in the file name?  If so that
	      should be changed to just <filename>file.in</filename>
	      since new <filename>rc.d</filename> files may not end
	      with that extension.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the file have a
	      <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal> tag?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Do the name of the file (minus
	      <filename>.in</filename>), the
	      <literal>PROVIDE</literal> line, and
	      <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	      all match?  The file name matching
	      <literal>PROVIDE</literal> makes debugging easier,
	      especially for &man.rcorder.8; issues.  Matching the
	      file name and
	      <literal>&dollar;</literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>
	      makes it easier to figure out which variables are
	      relevant in <filename>rc.conf[.local]</filename>.  The
	      latter is also what you might call &ldquo;policy&rdquo;
	      for all new scripts, including those in the base
	      system.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Is the <literal>REQUIRE</literal> line set to
	      <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  This is mandatory for scripts
	      that run as a non-root user.  If it runs as root, is
	      there a good reason for it to run prior to
	      <literal>LOGIN</literal>?  If not, it should run there
	      so that we can loosely group local scripts to a point in
	      &man.rcorder.8; after most everything in the base is
	      already running.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script start a persistent service?  If so,
	      it should have <literal>KEYWORD:
		shutdown</literal>.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>

	    <para>Make sure there is no
	      <literal>KEYWORD: FreeBSD</literal> present.  This has
	      not been necessary or desirable for years.  It is also
	      an indication that the new script was copy/pasted from
	      an old script, so extra caution should be given to the
	      review.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If the script uses an interpreted language like
	      <command>perl</command>, <command>python</command>, or
	      <command>ruby</command>, make certain that
	      <varname>command_interpreter</varname> is set
	      appropriately.  Otherwise,</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>service name stop</userinput></screen>

	    <para>will probably not work properly.  See
	      &man.service.8; for more information.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Have all occurrences of
	      <filename>/usr/local</filename> been replaced with
	      <literal>%%PREFIX%%</literal>?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Do the default variable assignments come after
	      <function>load_rc_config</function>?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are there default assignments to empty strings?
	      They should be removed, but double-check that the option
	      is documented in the comments at the top of the
	      file.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are things that are set in variables actually used
	      in the script?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Are options listed in the default
	      <replaceable>name</replaceable><varname>_flags</varname>
	      things that are actually mandatory?  If so, they should
	      be in <varname>command_args</varname>.  The
	      <option>-d</option> option is a red flag (pardon the
	      pun) here, since it is usually the option to
	      &ldquo;daemonize&rdquo; the process, and therefore is
	      actually mandatory.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>The
	      <replaceable>name</replaceable><varname>_flags</varname>
	      variable should never be included in
	      <varname>command_args</varname> (and vice versa,
	      although that error is less common).</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script execute any code unconditionally?
	      This is frowned on.  Usually these things can/should be
	      dealt with through a
	      <function>start_precmd</function>.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>All boolean tests should utilize the
	      <function>checkyesno</function> function.  No
	      hand-rolled tests for <literal>[Yy][Ee][Ss]</literal>,
	      etc.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>If there is a loop (for example, waiting for
	      something to start) does it have a counter to terminate
	      the loop?  We do not want the boot to be stuck forever
	      if there is an error.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Does the script create files or directories that
	      need specific permissions, for example, a
	      <filename>pid</filename> file that needs to be owned by
	      the user that runs the process?  Rather than the
	      traditional &man.touch.1;/&man.chown.8;/&man.chmod.1;
	      routine, consider using &man.install.1; with the proper
	      command line arguments to do the whole procedure with
	      one step.</para>

      <title>Changing <filename>pkg-plist</filename> Based on Make
	Variables</title>

      <para>Some ports, particularly the <literal>p5-</literal> ports,
	need to change their <filename>pkg-plist</filename> depending
	on what options they are configured with (or version of
	<literal>perl</literal>, in the case of <literal>p5-</literal>
	ports).  To make this easy, any instances in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> of
	<literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>, <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal>,
	and <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal> will be substituted
	for appropriately.  The value of <literal>%%OSREL%%</literal>
	is the numeric revision of the operating system (e.g.,
	<literal>4.9</literal>).  <literal>%%PERL_VERSION%%</literal>
	and <literal>%%PERL_VER%%</literal> is the full version number
	of <command>perl</command> (e.g., <literal>5.8.9</literal>).
	Several other
	<literal>%%VARS%%</literal> related
	to port's documentation files are described in
	<link linkend="install-documentation">the relevant
	  section</link>.</para>

      <para>If you need to make other substitutions, you can set the
	<varname>PLIST_SUB</varname> variable with a list of
	<literal>VAR=VALUE</literal>
	pairs and instances of
	<literal>%%VAR%%</literal> will be
	substituted with <replaceable>VALUE</replaceable> in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>For instance, if you have a port that installs many files
	in a version-specific subdirectory, you can put something
	like</para>

      <programlisting>OCTAVE_VERSION=	2.0.13
PLIST_SUB=	OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}</programlisting>

      <para>in the <filename>Makefile</filename> and use
	<literal>%%OCTAVE_VERSION%%</literal> wherever the version
	shows up in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That way, when
	you upgrade the port, you will not have to change dozens (or
	in some cases, hundreds) of lines in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>

      <para>If your port installs files conditionally on the options
	set in the port, the usual way of handling it is prefixing the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> lines with a
	<literal>%%TAG%%</literal> and adding that
	<literal>TAG</literal> to the <varname>PLIST_SUB</varname>
	variable inside the <filename>Makefile</filename> with a
	special value of <literal>@comment</literal>, which makes
	package tools to ignore the line:</para>

      <programlisting>.if defined(WITH_X11)
PLIST_SUB+=	X11=""
.else
PLIST_SUB+=	X11="@comment "
.endif</programlisting>

      <para>and in the <filename>pkg-plist</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>%%X11%%bin/foo-gui</programlisting>

      <para>This substitution
	will be
	done between the <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> and
	<buildtarget>do-install</buildtarget> targets, by reading from
	<filename>PLIST</filename> and writing to
	<filename>TMPPLIST</filename> (default:
	<filename>WRKDIR/.PLIST.mktmp</filename>).
	So if your port builds
	<filename>PLIST</filename> on the fly, do
	so in or before <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget>.  Also,
	if your port needs to edit the resulting file, do so in
	<buildtarget>post-install</buildtarget> to a file named
	<filename>TMPPLIST</filename>.</para>

      <para>Another way of modifying a port's packing list is based
	on setting the variables <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>,
	<varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>, and
	<varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname>.  The value of each variable
	is regarded as a list of pathnames to write to
	<filename>TMPPLIST</filename> along with
	<filename>PLIST</filename> contents.  Names
	listed in <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>,
	<varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>, and
	<varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> are subject to
	<literal>%%VAR%%</literal>
	substitution as described above.  Except for that, names from
	<varname>PLIST_FILES</varname> will appear in the final
	packing list unchanged, while <literal>@dirrm</literal> and
	<literal>@dirrmtry</literal> will
	be prepended to names from <varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>
	and <varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname>, respectively.  To
	take effect, <varname>PLIST_FILES</varname>,
	<varname>PLIST_DIRS</varname>, and
	<varname>PLIST_DIRSTRY</varname> must be set before
	<filename>TMPPLIST</filename> is written,
	i.e., in <buildtarget>pre-install</buildtarget> or
	earlier.</para>

	<para>Empty directories created during port installation need

	  installing the package, because packages only store the
	  files, and &man.pkg.add.1; creates directories for them as
	  needed.  To make sure the empty directory is created when

      <title>Configuration Files</title>

      <para>If your port installs configuration files to
	<filename>PREFIX/etc</filename> (or
	elsewhere) do <emphasis>not</emphasis> simply list them in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  That will cause
	&man.pkg.delete.1; to remove the files carefully edited by
	the user, and a re-installation will wipe them out.</para>

      <para>Instead, install sample file(s) with a
	<filename>filename.sample</filename>
	suffix.  Then copy the sample file to the real configuration
	file name, if it does not already exist.  On deinstall
	delete the configuration file, but only if it is identical
	to the <filename>.sample</filename> file.
	You need to handle this both in the port
	<filename>Makefile</filename>, and in the
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> (for installation from the
	package).</para>

      <para>Example of the <filename>Makefile</filename> part:</para>

      <programlisting>post-install:
	@if [ ! -f ${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf ]; then \
	${CP} -p ${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf.sample ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/etc/orbit.conf ; \
	fi</programlisting>

      <para>For each configuration file, create the following three
	lines in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>@unexec if cmp -s %D/etc/orbit.conf.sample %D/etc/orbit.conf; then rm -f %D/etc/orbit.conf; fi
etc/orbit.conf.sample
@exec if [ ! -f %D/etc/orbit.conf ] ; then cp -p %D/%F %B/orbit.conf; fi</programlisting>

      <para>The order of these lines is important.  On deinstallation,
	the sample file is compared to the actual configuration file.
	If these files are identical, no changes have been made by the
	user and the actual file can be safely deleted.  Because the
	sample file must still exist for the comparison, the
	<literal>@unexec</literal> line comes before the sample
	configuration file name.  On installation, if an actual
	configuration file is not already present, the sample file is
	copied to the actual file.  The sample file must be present
	before it can be copied, so the <literal>@exec</literal> line
	comes after the sample configuration file name.</para>

      <para>To debug any issues, temporarily remove the
	<literal>-s</literal> flag to &man.cmp.1; for more
	output.</para>

      <para>See &man.pkg.create.1; for more information on
	<literal>%D</literal> and related substitution markers.</para>

      <para>If there is a very good reason not to install a working
	configuration file by default, leave the
	<literal>@exec</literal> line out of
	<filename>pkg-plist</filename> and add a

      <para>A <emphasis>dynamic package list</emphasis> is a package
	list which is generated at the time the port is compiled based

      <para>While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden,

	Dynamic lists should be primarily used for complex ports where
	the package list changes drastically based upon optional
	features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package

      <para><varname>DESTDIR</varname>, if set by the user, determines

	<filename>/</filename>.  A port will actually install into
	<filename>DESTDIR/PREFIX</filename>,
	and register with the package database in
	<filename>DESTDIR/var/db/pkg</filename>.
	As <varname>DESTDIR</varname> is handled automatically by the
	ports infrastructure with &man.chroot.8;, you do not need any
	modifications or any extra care to write
	<varname>DESTDIR</varname>-compliant ports.</para>

      <para>The value of <varname>PREFIX</varname> will be set to

      <para>Avoiding hard-coded <filename>/usr/local</filename> paths

	<filename>Makefile</filename>s with
	<literal>&dollar;{PREFIX}</literal>.  This variable is
	automatically passed down to every stage of the build and

      <para>Make sure your application is not installing things in

      <para>If anything is installed outside of

      <para>In addition, it is worth checking the same with the
	stage directory support (see <xref linkend="staging"/>):</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make stage &amp;&amp; make check-orphans &amp;&amp; make package</userinput></screen>

      <para>These tests will not find hard-coded paths inside the
	port's files, nor will it verify that
	<varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is being used to correctly refer
	to files from other ports.  The temporarily-installed port in
	<filename>/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</filename> should be
	tested for proper operation to make sure there
	are no problems with paths.</para>

      <para><varname>PREFIX</varname> should not be set explicitly

	the port may have set <varname>PREFIX</varname> to a custom
	location, and the port should respect that setting.</para>

      <para>Refer to programs and files from other ports with the
	variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For
	instance, if your port requires a macro
	<literal>PAGER</literal> to have the full pathname of

    <para>When you notice that a port is out of date compared to the

      ensure that you have the latest port.  You can find them in the
      <filename>ports/ports-current</filename> directory of the &os;
      FTP mirror sites.  However, if you are working with more than a
      few ports, you will probably find it easier to use
      <application>Subversion</application> or &man.portsnap.8;
      to keep your whole ports
      collection up-to-date, as described in the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/ports-using.html">Handbook</link>.
      This will have the added benefit of tracking all the ports'

      (also known as <literal>portsmon</literal>).  This system
      attempts to classify port PRs by portname.  To search for PRs
      about a particular port, use the <link xlink:href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">Overview of
	One Port</link>.</para>

    <para>If there is no pending PR, the next step is to send an email
      to the port's maintainer, as shown by
      <command>make maintainer</command>.  That person may already be
      working on an upgrade, or have a reason to not upgrade the port
      right now (because of, for example, stability problems of the
      new version); you would not want to duplicate their work.  Note
      that unmaintained ports are listed with a maintainer of
      <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>, which is just the general
      ports mailing list, so sending mail there probably will not help
      in this case.</para>

    <para>If the maintainer asks you to do the upgrade or there is
      no maintainer, then you have a chance to help out &os; by
      preparing the update yourself!  Please do this by using the
      &man.diff.1; command in the base system.</para>

    <para>To create a suitable <command>diff</command> for a single
      patch, copy the file that needs patching to
      <replaceable>something.orig</replaceable>, save your changes to
      <replaceable>something</replaceable> and then create your
      patch:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -u something.orig something &gt; something.diff</userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Otherwise, you should either use the
      <command>svn diff</command> method (<xref linkend="svn-diff"/>)
      or copy the contents of the port to an entire different
      directory and use the result of the recursive &man.diff.1;
      output of the new and old ports directories (e.g., if your
      modified port directory is called <filename>superedit</filename>
      and the original is in our tree as
      <filename>superedit.bak</filename>, then save the result of
      <command>diff -ruN superedit.bak superedit</command>).  Either
      unified or context diff is fine, but port committers generally
      prefer unified diffs.  Note the use of the <literal>-N</literal>
      option&mdash;this is the accepted way to force diff to properly
      deal with the case of new files being added or old files being
      deleted.  Before sending us the diff, please examine the output
      to make sure all the changes make sense.  (In particular, make
      sure you first clean out the work directories with
      <command>make clean</command>).</para>

    <para>To simplify common operations with patch files, you can use
      <filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/patchtool.py</filename>.
      Before using it, please read
      <filename>/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/README.patchtool</filename>.</para>

    <para>If the port is unmaintained, and you are actively using
      it yourself, please consider volunteering to become its
      maintainer.  &os; has over 4000 ports without maintainers, and
      this is an area where more volunteers are always needed.  (For a
      detailed description of the responsibilities of maintainers,
      refer to the section in the <link xlink:href="&url.books.developers-handbook;/policies.html#POLICIES-MAINTAINER">
	Developer's Handbook</link>.)</para>

    <para>The best way to send us the diff is by including it via
      &man.send-pr.1; (category <literal>ports</literal>).  If you are
      maintaining the port, be sure to put <literal>[maintainer
      update]</literal> at the beginning of your synopsis line and set
      the <quote>Class</quote> of your PR to
      <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  Otherwise, the
      <quote>Class</quote> of your PR should be
      <literal>change-request</literal>.  Please mention any added or
      deleted files in the message, as they have to be explicitly
      specified to &man.svn.1; when doing a commit.  If the diff is
      more than about 20KB, please compress and uuencode it;
      otherwise, just include it in the PR as is.</para>

    <para>Before you &man.send-pr.1;, you should review the
      <link xlink:href="&url.articles.problem-reports;/pr-writing.html">
      Writing the problem report</link> section in the Problem
      Reports article; it contains far more information about how to
      write useful problem reports.</para>

    <important>
      <para>If your upgrade is motivated by security concerns or a
	serious fault in the currently committed port, please notify
	the &a.portmgr; to request immediate rebuilding and
	redistribution of your port's package.  Unsuspecting users

	old version via <command>pkg_add -r</command> for several

    <sect1 xml:id="security-intro">
      <title>Why Security is So Important</title>

      <para>Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software.
	Arguably, the most dangerous of them are those opening
	security vulnerabilities.  From the technical viewpoint, such
	vulnerabilities are to be closed by exterminating the bugs
	that caused them.  However, the policies for handling mere
	bugs and security vulnerabilities are very different.</para>

      <para>A typical small bug affects only those users who have
	enabled some combination of options triggering the bug.  The
	developer will eventually release a patch followed by a new
	version of the software, free of the bug, but the majority of
	users will not take the trouble of upgrading immediately
	because the bug has never vexed them.  A critical bug that may
	cause data loss represents a graver issue.  Nevertheless,
	prudent users know that a lot of possible accidents, besides
	software bugs, are likely to lead to data loss, and so they
	make backups of important data; in addition, a critical bug
	will be discovered really soon.</para>

      <para>A security vulnerability is all different.  First, it may
	remain unnoticed for years because often it does not cause
	software malfunction.  Second, a malicious party can use it to
	gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable system, to destroy or
	alter sensitive data; and in the worst case the user will not
	even notice the harm caused.  Third, exposing a vulnerable
	system often assists attackers to break into other systems
	that could not be compromised otherwise.  Therefore closing a
	vulnerability alone is not enough: the audience should be
	notified of it in most clear and comprehensive manner, which
	will allow to evaluate the danger and take appropriate
	actions.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="security-fix">
      <title>Fixing Security Vulnerabilities</title>

      <para>While on the subject of ports and packages, a security
	vulnerability may initially appear in the original
	distribution or in the port files.  In the former case, the
	original software developer is likely to release a patch or a
	new version instantly, and you will only need to update the
	port promptly with respect to the author's fix.  If the fix is
	delayed for some reason, you should either
	<link linkend="dads-noinstall">mark the port as
	<varname>FORBIDDEN</varname></link> or introduce a patch file
	of your own to the port.  In the case of a vulnerable port,
	just fix the port as soon as possible.  In either case,
	<link linkend="port-upgrading">the standard procedure for
	submitting your change</link> should be followed unless you
	have rights to commit it directly to the ports tree.</para>

      <important>
	<para>Being a ports committer is not enough to commit to
	  an arbitrary port.  Remember that ports usually have
	  maintainers, whom you should respect.</para>
      </important>

      <para>Please make sure that the port's revision is bumped
	as soon as the vulnerability has been closed.
	That is how the users who upgrade installed packages
	on a regular basis will see they need to run an update.
	Besides, a new package will be built and distributed
	over FTP and WWW mirrors, replacing the vulnerable one.
	<varname>PORTREVISION</varname> should be bumped unless
	<varname>PORTVERSION</varname> has changed in the course
	of correcting the vulnerability.  That is you should
	bump <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> if you have added a
	patch file to the port, but you should not if you have updated
	the port to the latest software version and thus already
	touched <varname>PORTVERSION</varname>.  Please refer to the
	<link linkend="makefile-naming-revepoch">corresponding
	  section</link> for more information.</para>

      <title>Keeping the Community Informed</title>

      <sect2 xml:id="security-notify-vuxml-db">
	<title>The VuXML Database</title>

	<para>A very important and urgent step to take as early after
	  a security vulnerability is discovered as possible is to
	  notify the community of port users about the jeopardy.  Such
	  notification serves two purposes.  First, should the danger
	  be really severe it will be wise to apply an instant
	  workaround.  E.g., stop the affected network service or even
	  deinstall the port completely until the vulnerability is
	  closed.  Second, a lot of users tend to upgrade installed
	  packages only occasionally.  They will know from the
	  notification that they <emphasis>must</emphasis> update the
	  package without delay as soon as a corrected version is
	  available.</para>

	<para>Given the huge number of ports in the tree a security
	  advisory cannot be issued on each incident without creating
	  a flood and losing the attention of the audience when it
	  comes to really serious matters.  Therefore security
	  vulnerabilities found in ports are recorded in
	  <link xlink:href="http://vuxml.freebsd.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
	  database</link>.  The Security Officer Team members also
	  monitor it for issues requiring their intervention.</para>

	<para>If you have committer rights you can update the VuXML
	  database by yourself.  So you will both help the Security
	  Officer Team and deliver the crucial information to the
	  community earlier.  However, if you are not a committer, or
	  you believe you have found an exceptionally severe
	  vulnerability please do not hesitate to contact the Security
	  Officer Team directly as described on the
	  <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsd.org/security/#how">FreeBSD
	    Security Information</link> page.</para>

	<para>The VuXML database is an XML document.  Its source file
	  <filename>vuln.xml</filename> is kept right inside the port
	  <package>security/vuxml</package>.
	  Therefore the file's full pathname will be
	  <filename>PORTSDIR/security/vuxml/vuln.xml</filename>.
	  Each time you discover a security vulnerability in a port
	  please add an entry for it to that file.  Until you are
	  familiar with VuXML, the best thing you can do is to find an
	  existing entry fitting your case, then copy it and use it as
	  a template.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="security-notify-vuxml-intro">
	<title>A Short Introduction to VuXML</title>

	<para>The full-blown XML format is complex, and far beyond the
	  scope of this book.  However, to gain basic insight on the
	  structure of a VuXML entry you need only the notion of tags.
	  XML tag names are enclosed in angle brackets.  Each opening
	  &lt;tag&gt; must have a matching closing &lt;/tag&gt;.  Tags
	  may be nested.  If nesting, the inner tags must be closed
	  before the outer ones.  There is a hierarchy of tags, i.e.,
	  more complex rules of nesting them.  This is similar to
	  HTML.  The major difference is that XML is
	  e<emphasis>X</emphasis>tensible, i.e., based on defining
	  custom tags.  Due to its intrinsic structure XML puts
	  otherwise amorphous data into shape.  VuXML is particularly
	  tailored to mark up descriptions of security
	  vulnerabilities.</para>

	install itself.  Please use the correct
	<command>make</command> variable as each make variable conveys
	radically different meanings to both users, and to automated
	systems that depend on the <filename>Makefile</filename>s,

	    <para><varname>BROKEN</varname> is reserved for ports that

	    <para>If instructed, the build cluster will still attempt

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><varname>FORBIDDEN</varname> is used for ports that
	      contain a security vulnerability or induce grave concern
	      regarding the security of a FreeBSD system with a given
	      port installed (e.g., a reputably insecure program or a
	      program that provides easily exploitable services).
	      Ports should be marked as <varname>FORBIDDEN</varname>
	      as soon as a particular piece of software has a
	      vulnerability and there is no released upgrade.  Ideally
	      ports should be upgraded as soon as possible when a
	      security vulnerability is discovered so as to reduce the
	      number of vulnerable FreeBSD hosts (we like being known
	      for being secure), however sometimes there is a
	      noticeable time gap between disclosure of a
	      vulnerability and an updated release of the vulnerable
	      software.  Do not mark a port
	      <varname>FORBIDDEN</varname> for any reason other than
	      security.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><varname>IGNORE</varname> is reserved for ports that
	      should not be built for some other reason.  It should be

      <para>When it makes sense to do so, users can be warned about

      <para>It is possible to set <varname>DEPRECATED</varname>

      <para>It is a common mistake to use <literal>.error</literal>

    <title>Keeping Up</title>

    <para>The &os; Ports Collection is constantly changing.  Here is
      some information on how to keep up.</para>

    <sect1 xml:id="freshports">
      <title>FreshPorts</title>

      <para>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have
	already been committed is by subscribing to
	<link xlink:href="http://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts</link>.
	You can select multiple ports to monitor.  Maintainers are
	strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive
	notification of not only their own changes, but also any
	changes that any other &os; committer has made.  (These are
	often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying
	ports framework&mdash;although it would be most polite to
	receive an advance heads-up from those committing such
	changes, sometimes this is overlooked or just simply
	impractical.  Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor
	in nature.  We expect everyone to use their best judgement in
	these cases.)</para>

      <para>If you wish to use FreshPorts, all you need is an account.
	If your registered email address is
	<literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, you will see the opt-in link
	on the right hand side of the webpages.  For those of you who
	already have a FreshPorts account, but are not using your
	<literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal> email address, just change
	your email to <literal>@FreeBSD.org</literal>, subscribe, then
	change it back again.</para>

      <para>FreshPorts also has a sanity test feature which
	automatically tests each commit to the FreeBSD ports tree.  If
	subscribed to this service, you will be notified of any errors
	which FreshPorts detects during sanity testing of your
	commits.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="svnweb">
      <title>The Web Interface to the Source Repository</title>

      <para>It is possible to browse the files in the source
	repository by using a web interface.  Changes that affect the
	entire port system are now documented in the <link xlink:href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/CHANGES">CHANGES</link>
	file.  Changes that affect individual ports
	are now documented in the <link xlink:href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/UPDATING">UPDATING</link>

	building the Ports Collection, for each of the major OS
	releases and for each Tier-1 architecture.</para>

      <para>Individual ports are built unless they are specifically
	marked with <varname>IGNORE</varname>.  Ports that are

	distfiles can quickly go missing.
	<link xlink:href="http://portscout.FreeBSD.org">Portscout</link>,
	the &os; Ports distfile scanner, attempts to query every
	download site for every port to find out if each distfile is

	generate <acronym>HTML</acronym> reports and send emails about
	newly available ports to those who request them.  Unless not
	otherwise subscribed, maintainers are asked to check
	periodically for changes, either by hand or using the
	<acronym>RSS</acronym> feed.</para>

      <para><application>Portscout</application>'s first page gives
	the email address of the port maintainer, the number of ports
	the maintainer is responsible for, the number of those ports
	with new distfiles, and the percentage of those ports that are
	out-of-date.  The search function allows for searching by
	email address for a specific maintainer, and for selecting
	whether or not only out-of-date ports should be shown.</para>

      <para>Upon clicking on a maintainer's email address, a list of
	all of their ports is displayed, along with port category,
	current version number, whether or not there is a new version,
	when the port was last updated, and finally when it was last
	checked.  A search function on this page allows the user to
	search for a specific port.</para>

      <para>Clicking on a port name in the list displays the
	<link xlink:href="http://freshports.org">FreshPorts</link> port
	information.</para>

      <title>The &os; Ports Monitoring System</title>

      <para>Another handy resource is the
	<link xlink:href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Ports
	  Monitoring System</link> (also known as
	<literal>portsmon</literal>).  This system comprises a
	database that processes information from several sources and
	allows it to be browsed via a web interface.  Currently, the
	ports Problem Reports (PRs), the error logs from the build
	cluster, and individual files from the ports collection are
	used.  In the future, this will be expanded to include the
	distfile survey, as well as other sources.</para>

      <para>To get started, you can view all information about a
	particular port by using the <link xlink:href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portoverview.py">Overview
	  of One Port</link>.</para>

      <para>As of this writing, this is the only resource available
	that maps GNATS PR entries to portnames.  (PR submitters do
	not always include the portname in their Synopsis, although we
	would prefer that they did.)  So, <literal>portsmon</literal>
	is a good place to start if you want to find out whether an
	existing port has any PRs filed against it and/or any build
	errors; or, to find out if a new port that you may be thinking
	about creating has already been submitted.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as
	  <quote>2.2.5-STABLE</quote> after the 2.2.5-RELEASE.  The
	  pattern used to be year followed by the month, but we
	  decided to change it to a more straightforward major/minor
	  system starting from 2.2.  This is because the parallel
	  development on several branches made it infeasible to
	  classify the releases simply by their real release dates.
	  If you are making a port now, you do not have to worry about
	  old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for your
	  reference.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Here is a list of common dos and don'ts that are encountered
      during the porting process.  Check the port against this list,
      but also check ports in the <link
	xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/">PR
	database</link> that others have submitted.  Submit any
      comments on ports as described in <link
	xlink:href="&url.articles.contributing;/contrib-how.html#CONTRIB-GENERAL">Bug
	Reports and General Commentary</link>.  Checking ports in the
      PR database will both make it faster for us to commit them, and
      prove that you know what you are doing.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-wrkdir">
    <title><varname>WRKDIR</varname></title>

    <para>Do not write anything to files outside
      <varname>WRKDIR</varname>.  <varname>WRKDIR</varname> is the
      only place that is guaranteed to be writable during the port
      build (see <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/ports-using.html#PORTS-CD">
	installing ports from a CDROM</link> for an example of
      building ports from a read-only tree).  The
      <filename>pkg-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> files can
      be modified by <link linkend="pkg-names">redefining a

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-wrkdirprefix">
    <title><varname>WRKDIRPREFIX</varname></title>

    <para>Make sure the port honors <varname>WRKDIRPREFIX</varname>.
      Most ports do not have to worry about this.  In particular, when
      referring to a <varname>WRKDIR</varname> of another
      port, note that the correct location is
      <filename>WRKDIRPREFIXPORTSDIR/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename>
      not
      <filename>PORTSDIR/<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename>
      or
      <filename>.CURDIR/../../<replaceable>subdir</replaceable>/<replaceable>name</replaceable>/work</filename>
      or some such.</para>

    <para>Also, if defining <varname>WRKDIR</varname>,
      make sure to prepend
      <literal>&dollar;{WRKDIRPREFIX}&dollar;{.CURDIR}</literal> in
      the front.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-versions">
    <title>Differentiating Operating Systems and OS Versions</title>

    <para>Some code needs modifications or
      conditional compilation based upon what version of &os; Unix it
      is running under.  The preferred way to tell &os; versions apart
      are the <literal>__FreeBSD_version</literal> and
      <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> macros defined in <link
	xlink:href="http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/sys/param.h?view=markup">sys/param.h</link>.

      <para>to the proper place in the <filename>.c</filename>
	file.</para>

      <para><literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined in all versions
	of &os; as their major version number.  For example, in &os;
	9.x, <literal>__FreeBSD__</literal> is defined to be

    <para>Do not write anything after the

      usually can be avoided by including

  <sect1 xml:id="dads-sh-exec">
    <title>Use the <function>exec</function> Statement in Wrapper
      Scripts</title>

    <para>If the port installs a shell script whose purpose is to
      launch another program, and if launching that program is the
      last action performed by the script, make sure to launch the
      program using the <function>exec</function> statement, for
      instance:</para>

    <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
exec %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/java -jar %%DATADIR%%/foo.jar "$@"</programlisting>

    <para>The <function>exec</function> statement replaces the shell
      process with the specified program.  If
      <function>exec</function> is omitted, the shell process remains
      in memory while the program is executing, and needlessly
      consumes system resources.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="dads-rational">
    <title>Do Things Rationally</title>

    <para>The <filename>Makefile</filename> should do things in a
      simple and reasonable manner.  Making it a couple of lines
      shorter or more readable is always better.  Examples include
      using a make <literal>.if</literal> construct instead of a shell
      <literal>if</literal> construct, not redefining
      <buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget> if redefining
      <varname>EXTRACT*</varname> is enough, and using
      <varname>GNU_CONFIGURE</varname> instead of
      <literal>CONFIGURE_ARGS
	+= --prefix=&dollar;{PREFIX}</literal>.</para>

    <para>If a lot of new code is needed to do something, there may
      already be an implementation of it in
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>.  While hard to read, there are
      a great many seemingly-hard problems for which
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> already provides a shorthand

  <sect1 xml:id="dads-cc">
    <title>Respect Both <varname>CC</varname> and
      <varname>CXX</varname></title>

    <para>The port must respect both <varname>CC</varname> and
      <varname>CXX</varname>.  What we mean by this is that
      the port must not set the values of these variables absolutely,
      overriding existing values; instead, it may append whatever
      values it needs to the existing values.  This is so that build
      options that affect all ports can be set globally.</para>

    <para>If the port does not respect these variables,
      please add
      <literal>NO_PACKAGE=ignores either cc or cxx</literal> to the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

    <para>Here is an example of a <filename>Makefile</filename>
      respecting both <varname>CC</varname> and
      <varname>CXX</varname>.  Note the <literal>?=</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>CC?= gcc</programlisting>

    <programlisting>CXX?= g++</programlisting>

    <para>Here is an example which respects neither
      <varname>CC</varname> nor <varname>CXX</varname>:</para>

    <programlisting>CC= gcc</programlisting>

    <programlisting>CXX= g++</programlisting>

    <para>Both <varname>CC</varname> and <varname>CXX</varname>
      can be defined on &os; systems in
      <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.  The first example defines
      a value if it was not previously set in
      <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>, preserving any system-wide
      definitions.  The second example clobbers anything previously
      defined.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="dads-cflags">
    <title>Respect <varname>CFLAGS</varname></title>

    <para>The port must respect <varname>CFLAGS</varname>.
      What we mean by this is that the port must not set
      the value of this variable absolutely, overriding the existing
      value.  Instead, it may append whatever values it needs to the
      existing value.  This is so that build options that affect all
      ports can be set globally.</para>

    <para>If it does not, please add
      <literal>NO_PACKAGE=ignores cflags</literal> to the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

    <para>Here is an example of a <filename>Makefile</filename>
      respecting <varname>CFLAGS</varname>.  Note the
      <literal>+=</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>CFLAGS+= -Wall -Werror</programlisting>

    <para>Here is an example which does not respect
      <varname>CFLAGS</varname>:</para>

    <programlisting>CFLAGS= -Wall -Werror</programlisting>

    <para><varname>CFLAGS</varname> is defined on
      &os; systems in <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>.  The first
      example appends additional flags to
      <varname>CFLAGS</varname>, preserving any system-wide
      definitions.  The second example clobbers anything previously
      defined.</para>

    <para>Remove optimization flags from the third party
      <filename>Makefile</filename>s.  The system
      <varname>CFLAGS</varname> contains system-wide optimization
      flags.  An example from an unmodified
      <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>CFLAGS= -O3 -funroll-loops -DHAVE_SOUND</programlisting>

    <para>Using system optimization flags, the

    <para>In certain cases, users must be prevented from installing
      a port.  There are several variables that can be used in a
      port's <filename>Makefile</filename> to tell the user that the
      port cannot be installed.  The value of
      these make variables will be the
      reason that is shown to users for why the port refuses to
      install itself.  Please use the correct make
      variable.  Each variable conveys radically different
      meanings, both to users and to automated systems that depend on

    <para>When it makes sense to do so, users can be warned about
      a pending port removal with <varname>DEPRECATED</varname> and
      <varname>EXPIRATION_DATE</varname>.  The former is a
      string stating why the port is scheduled for removal; the latter
      is a string in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).  Both will be shown
      to the user.</para>

    <para>It is possible to set <varname>DEPRECATED</varname>

    <para>There is no set policy on how much notice to give.

    <para>The correct way for a <filename>Makefile</filename> to

    <title>Usage of <filename>sysctl</filename></title>

    <para>The usage of <filename>sysctl</filename> is discouraged
      except in targets.  This is because the evaluation of any
      <literal>makevar</literal>s, such as used during
      <command>make index</command>, then has to run the command,
      further slowing down that process.</para>

    <para>Only use &man.sysctl.8; through
      <varname>SYSCTL</varname>, as it contains the fully
      qualified path and can be overridden, if one has such a
      special need.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="dads-rerolling-distfiles">
    <title>Rerolling Distfiles</title>

    <para>Sometimes the authors of software change the content of
      released distfiles without changing the file's name.
      Verify that the changes are official and have been performed
      by the author.  It has happened in the past that the distfile
      was silently altered on the download servers with the intent to
      cause harm or compromise end user security.</para>

    <para>Put the old distfile aside, download the new one, unpack
      them and compare the content with &man.diff.1;.  If there is
      nothing suspicious, update
      <filename>distinfo</filename>.  Be sure to summarize the
      differences in the PR or commit log, so that other people know
      that nothing bad has
      happened.</para>

    <para>Contact the authors of the software
      and confirm the changes with them.</para>

    <title>Avoiding Linuxisms</title>

    <para>Do not use <filename>/proc</filename> if there are any
      other ways of getting the information.  For example,
      <function>setprogname(argv[0])</function> in
      <function>main()</function> and then &man.getprogname.3;
      to know the executable name>.</para>

    <para>Do not rely on behavior that is undocumented by
      <acronym>POSIX</acronym>.</para>

    <para>Do not record timestamps in the critical path of the
      application if it also works without.  Getting timestamps may be
      slow, depending on the accuracy of timestamps in the
      <acronym>OS</acronym>.  If timestamps are really needed,
      determine how precise they have to be and use an
      <acronym>API</acronym> which is documented to just deliver the
      needed precision.</para>

    <para>A number of simple syscalls (for example
      &man.gettimeofday.2;, &man.getpid.2;) are much faster on &linux;
      than on any other operating system due to caching and the
      vsyscall performance optimizations.  Do not rely on them being
      cheap in performance-critical applications.  In general, try
      hard to avoid syscalls if possible.</para>

    <para>Do not rely on &linux;-specific socket behaviour.  In
      particular, default socket buffer sizes are different (call
      &man.setsockopt.2; with <literal>SO_SNDBUF</literal> and
      <literal>SO_RCVBUF</literal>, and while &linux;'s &man.send.2;
      blocks when the socket buffer is full, &os;'s will fail and
      set <literal>ENOBUFS</literal> in errno.</para>

    <para>If relying on non-standard behaviour is required,
      encapsulate it properly into a generic <acronym>API</acronym>,
      do a check for the behaviour in the configure stage, and stop
      if it is missing.</para>

    <para>Check the
      <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">man
	pages</link> to see if the function used is a
      <acronym>POSIX</acronym> interface (in the
      <quote>STANDARDS</quote> section of the man page).</para>

    <para>Do not assume that <filename>/bin/sh</filename> is
      <application>bash</application>.  Ensure that a command line
      passed to &man.system.3; will work with a
      <acronym>POSIX</acronym> compliant shell.</para>

    <para>A list of common <application>bash</application>isms is
      available <link
	xlink:href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh">here</link>.</para>

    <para>Check that headers are included in the
      <acronym>POSIX</acronym> or man page recommended way.  For
      example, <filename>sys/types.h</filename> is often forgotten,
      which is not as much of a problem for &linux; as it is for
      &os;.</para>

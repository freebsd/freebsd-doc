  <title>Making a New Port</title>

  <para>Interested in making a new port, or upgrading existing ports?
    Great!</para>

  <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
    &os;.  To upgrade an existing port, read
    this, then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading"/>.</para>

  <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed,
    refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which is
    included by all port <filename>Makefile</filename>s.  Even those
    not hacking <filename>Makefile</filename>s daily can gain much
    knowledge from it.  Additionally, specific questions can be sent
    to the &a.ports;.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Only a fraction of the variables
      (<varname><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></varname>) that can be
      overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not all)
      are documented at the start of
      <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>; the others
      probably ought to be.  Note that this file uses a non-standard
      tab setting: <application>Emacs</application> and
      <application>Vim</application> will recognize the setting on
      loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and &man.ex.1; can be set to
      use the correct value by typing
      <command>:set tabstop=4</command> once the file has been
      loaded.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Looking for something easy to start with? Take a look at the
    <link xlink:href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/WantedPorts">list of
      requested ports</link> and see if you can work on one (or
    more).</para>

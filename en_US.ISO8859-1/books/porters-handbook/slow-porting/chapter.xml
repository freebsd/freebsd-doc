  <title>Slow Porting</title>

  <para>Okay, so it was not that simple, and the port required some
    modifications to get it to work.  In this section, we will
    explain, step by step, how to modify it to get it to work with the
    ports paradigm.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="slow-work">
    <title>How Things Work</title>

    <para>First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when the
      user first types <command>make</command> in the port's
      directory.  Having
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> in another window while
      reading this really helps to understand it.</para>

    <para>But do not worry not many people understand exactly how
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> is working...
      <!-- smiley --><emphasis>:-)</emphasis></para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> target is run.  The
	  <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> target is responsible for
	  making sure that the tarball exists locally in
	  <varname>DISTDIR</varname>.  If
	  <buildtarget>fetch</buildtarget> cannot find the required
	  files in <varname>DISTDIR</varname> it will look up the URL
	  <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>, which is set in the
	  Makefile, as well as our FTP mirrors where we put distfiles
	  as backup.  It will then attempt to fetch the named
	  distribution file with <varname>FETCH</varname>, assuming
	  that the requesting site has direct access to the Internet.
	  If that succeeds, it will save the file in
	  <varname>DISTDIR</varname> for future use and
	  proceed.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget> target is run.
	  It looks for the port's distribution file (typically a
	  <command>gzip</command>ped tarball) in
	  <varname>DISTDIR</varname> and unpacks it into a temporary
	  subdirectory specified by <varname>WRKDIR</varname>
	  (defaults to <filename>work</filename>).</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>patch</buildtarget> target is run.
	  First, any patches defined in <varname>PATCHFILES</varname>
	  are applied.  Second, if any patch files named
	  <filename>patch-<replaceable>*</replaceable></filename> are
	  found in <varname>PATCHDIR</varname> (defaults to the
	  <filename>files</filename> subdirectory), they are applied
	  at this time in alphabetical order.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>configure</buildtarget> target is run.
	  This can do any one of many different things.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If it exists, <filename>scripts/configure</filename>
	      is run.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If <varname>HAS_CONFIGURE</varname> or
	      <varname>GNU_CONFIGURE</varname> is set,
	      <filename>WRKSRC/configure</filename> is run.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>build</buildtarget> target is run.
	  This is responsible for descending into the port's private
	  working directory (<varname>WRKSRC</varname>) and building
	  it.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>stage</buildtarget> target is run.
	  This puts the final set of built files into a temporary
	  directory (<varname>STAGEDIR</varname>, see
	  <xref linkend="staging"/>).  The hierarchy of this directory
	  mirrors that of the system on which the package will be
	  installed.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>package</buildtarget> target is run.
	  This creates a package using the files from the temporary
	  directory created during the
	  <buildtarget>stage</buildtarget> target and the port's
	  <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>The <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target is run.
	  This installs the package created during the
	  <buildtarget>package</buildtarget> target into the host
	  system.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>The above are the default actions.  In addition,
      define targets
      <buildtarget>pre-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>
      or
      <buildtarget>post-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>,
      or put scripts with those names, in the
      <filename>scripts</filename> subdirectory, and they will be
      run before or after the default actions are done.</para>

    <para>For example, if there is a
      <buildtarget>post-extract</buildtarget> target defined in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>, and a file
      <filename>pre-build</filename> in the
      <filename>scripts</filename> subdirectory, the
      <buildtarget>post-extract</buildtarget> target will be called
      after the regular extraction actions, and
      <filename>pre-build</filename> will be executed before
      the default build rules are done.  It is recommended to
      use <filename>Makefile</filename> targets if the actions are
      simple enough, because it will be easier for someone to figure
      out what kind of non-default action the port requires.</para>

    <para>The default actions are done by the
      <buildtarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>
      targets from <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>.
      For example, the commands to extract a port are in the target
      <buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget>.  If
      the default target does not do the job right, redefine the
      <buildtarget>do-<replaceable>something</replaceable></buildtarget>
      target in the <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The <quote>main</quote> targets (for example,
	<buildtarget>extract</buildtarget>,
	<buildtarget>configure</buildtarget>, etc.) do nothing more
	than make sure all the stages up to that one are completed and
	call the real targets or scripts, and they are not intended to
	be changed.  To fix the extraction, fix
	<buildtarget>do-extract</buildtarget>, but never ever change
	the way <buildtarget>extract</buildtarget> operates!
	Additionally, the target
	<buildtarget>post-deinstall</buildtarget> is invalid and is
	not run by the ports infrastructure.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Now that what goes on when the user types <command>make
	install</command> is better understood, let us go through the
      recommended steps to create the perfect port.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="slow-sources">
    <title>Getting the Original Sources</title>

    <para>Get the original sources (normally) as a compressed tarball
      (<filename>foo.tar.gz</filename> or
      <filename><replaceable>foo</replaceable>.tar.bz2</filename>) and
      copy it into <varname>DISTDIR</varname>.  Always use
      <emphasis>mainstream</emphasis> sources when and where
      possible.</para>

    <para>Set the variable
      <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> to reflect where the original
      tarball resides.  Shorthand definitions exist
      for most mainstream sites in <filename>bsd.sites.mk</filename>.
      Please use these sites&mdash;and the associated
      definitions&mdash;if at all possible, to help avoid the problem
      of having the same information repeated over again many times in
      the source base.  As these sites tend to change over time, this
      becomes a maintenance nightmare for everyone involved.  See
      <xref linkend="makefile-master_sites"/> for details.</para>

    <para>If there is no FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected to
      the net, or can only find sites that have irritatingly
      non-standard formats, put a copy on a reliable
      FTP or HTTP server (for example, a home
      page).</para>

    <para>If a convenient and reliable place to put
      the distfile cannot be found, we can <quote>house</quote> it ourselves on
      <systemitem>ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>; however, this is the
      least-preferred solution.  The distfile must be placed into
      <filename>~/public_distfiles/</filename> of someone's
      <systemitem>freefall</systemitem> account.  Ask the person who
      commits the port to do this.  This person will also set
      <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname> to
      <literal>LOCAL/<replaceable>username</replaceable></literal>
      where <literal><replaceable>username</replaceable></literal> is
      their &os; cluster login.</para>

    <para>If the port's distfile changes all the time without any
      kind of version update by the author, consider putting the
      distfile on a home page and listing it as the first
      <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.  Try to talk the
      port author out of doing this; it really does help to establish
      some kind of source code control.  Hosting a specific version will
      prevent users from getting
      <errorname>checksum mismatch</errorname> errors, and also reduce
      the workload of maintainers of our FTP site.  Also, if there is
      only one master site for the port, it is recommended to
      house a backup on a home page and list it as the second
      <varname>MASTER_SITES</varname>.</para>

    <para>If the port requires additional patches that are
      available on the Internet, fetch them too and put them in
      <varname>DISTDIR</varname>.  Do not worry if they come from a
      site other than where the main source tarball comes, we have a
      way to handle these situations (see the description of <link
	linkend="porting-patchfiles">PATCHFILES</link> below).</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="slow-modifying">
    <title>Modifying the Port</title>

    <para>Unpack a copy of the tarball in a private directory and make
      whatever changes are necessary to get the port to compile
      properly under the current version of &os;.  Keep
      <emphasis>careful track</emphasis> of steps, as they will be
      needed to automate the process shortly.  Everything, including
      the deletion, addition, or modification of files has to be
      doable using an automated script or patch file when the port is
      finished.</para>

    <para>If the port requires significant user
      interaction/customization to compile or install, take
      a look at one of Larry Wall's classic
      <application>Configure</application> scripts and perhaps do
      something similar.  The goal of the new ports
      collection is to make each port as <quote>plug-and-play</quote>
      as possible for the end-user while using a minimum of disk
      space.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Unless explicitly stated, patch files, scripts, and other
	files created and contributed to the &os; ports
	collection are assumed to be covered by the standard BSD
	copyright conditions.</para>
    </note>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="slow-patch">
    <title>Patching</title>

    <para>In the preparation of the port, files that have been added
      or changed can be recorded with &man.diff.1; for later feeding
      to &man.patch.1;.  Doing this with a typical file involves
      saving a copy of the original file before making any changes
      using a <filename>.orig</filename> suffix.</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cp <replaceable>file</replaceable> <replaceable>file</replaceable>.orig</userinput></screen>

    <para>After all changes have been made, <command>cd</command> back
      to the port directory.  Use <command>make makepatch</command> to
      generate updated patch files in the <filename>files</filename>
      directory.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="slow-patch-rules">
      <title>General Rules for Patching</title>

      <para>Patch files are stored in <varname>PATCHDIR</varname>,
	usually <filename>files/</filename>, from where they will be
	automatically applied.  All patches must be relative to
	<varname>WRKSRC</varname>.  Typically
	<varname>WRKSRC</varname> is a subdirectory of
	<varname>WRKDIR</varname>, the directory where the distfile is
	extracted.  Use <command>make -V WRKSRC</command> to see the
	actual path.  The patch names are to follow these
	rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Avoid having more than one patch modify the same file.
	    For example, having both
	    <filename>patch-foobar.c</filename> and
	    <filename>patch-foobar.c2</filename> making changes to
	    <filename>${WRKSRC}/foobar.c</filename> makes them fragile
	    and difficult to debug.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>When creating names for patch files, replace each
	    underscore (<literal>_</literal>) with two underscores
	    (<literal>__</literal>) and each slash
	    (<literal>/</literal>) with one underscore
	    (<literal>_</literal>).  For example, to patch a file
	    named <filename>src/freeglut_joystick.c</filename>, name
	    the corresponding patch
	    <filename>patch-src_freeglut__joystick.c</filename>.  Do
	    not name patches like <filename>patch-aa</filename> or
	    <filename>patch-ab</filename>.  Always use the path and
	    file name in patch names.  Using <command>make
	      makepatch</command> automatically generates the correct
	    names.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A patch may modify multiple files if the changes are
	    related and the patch is named appropriately.  For
	    example,
	    <filename>patch-add-missing-stdlib.h</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Only use characters <literal>[-+._a-zA-Z0-9]</literal>
	    for naming patches.  In particular, <emphasis>do not use
	      <literal>::</literal> as a path separator,</emphasis>
	    use <literal>_</literal> instead.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>


      <para>Minimize the amount of non-functional whitespace changes
	in patches.  It is common in the Open Source world for
	projects to share large amounts of a code base, but obey
	different style and indenting rules.  When taking a working
	piece of functionality from one project to fix similar areas
	in another, please be careful: the resulting patch may be full
	of non-functional changes.  It not only increases the size of
	the ports repository but makes it hard to find out what
	exactly caused the problem and what was changed at all.</para>

      <para>If a file must be deleted, do it in the
	<buildtarget>post-extract</buildtarget> target rather than as
	part of the patch.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="slow-patch-manual">
      <title>Manual Patch Generation</title>

      <note>
	<para>Manual patch creation is usually not necessary.
	  Automatic patch generation as described earlier in this
	  section is the preferred method.  However, manual patching
	  may be required occasionally.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Patches are saved into files named
	<filename>patch-*</filename> where
	<replaceable>*</replaceable> indicates the pathname of the
	file that is patched, such as
	<filename>patch-Imakefile</filename> or
	<filename>patch-src-config.h</filename>.</para>

      <para>After the file has been modified, &man.diff.1; is used to
	record the differences between the original and the modified
	version.  <option>-u</option> causes &man.diff.1; to produce
	<quote>unified</quote> diffs, the preferred form.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -u <replaceable>file</replaceable>.orig <replaceable>file</replaceable> &gt; patch-<replaceable>pathname-file</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>When generating patches for new, added files,
	<option>-N</option> is used to tell &man.diff.1; to treat the
	non-existent original file as if it existed but was
	empty:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -u -N <replaceable>newfile</replaceable>.orig <replaceable>newfile</replaceable> &gt; patch-<replaceable>pathname-newfile</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Do not add <literal>&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;</literal> RCS
	strings in patches.  When patches are added to the
	<application>Subversion</application> repository with
	<command>svn add</command>, the
	<literal>fbsd:nokeywords</literal> property is set to
	<literal>yes</literal> automatically so keywords in the patch
	are not modified when committed.  The property can be added
	manually with <command>svn propset fbsd:nokeywords yes
	  <replaceable>files...</replaceable></command>.</para>

      <para>Using the recurse (<option>-r</option>) option to
	&man.diff.1; to generate patches is fine, but please look at
	the resulting patches to make sure there is no unnecessary
	junk in there.  In particular, diffs between two backup files,
	<filename>Makefile</filename>s when the port uses
	<command>Imake</command> or GNU <command>configure</command>,
	etc., are unnecessary and have to be deleted.  If it was
	necessary to edit <filename>configure.in</filename> and run
	<command>autoconf</command> to regenerate
	<command>configure</command>, do not take the diffs of
	<command>configure</command> (it often grows to a few thousand
	lines!).  Instead, define
	<literal>USE_AUTOTOOLS=autoconf:261</literal> and take the
	diffs of <filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="slow-patch-automatic-replacements">
      <title>Simple Automatic Replacements</title>

      <para>Simple replacements can be performed directly from the
	port <filename>Makefile</filename> using the in-place mode of
	&man.sed.1;.  This is useful when changes use the value of a

      <programlisting>post-patch:
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|for Linux|for FreeBSD|g' ${WRKSRC}/README</programlisting>

      <para>Quite often, software being ported uses the CR/LF
	convention in source files.  This may cause problems with
	further patching, compiler warnings, or script execution (like
	<literal>/bin/sh^M not found</literal>.)  To quickly convert
	all files from CR/LF to just LF, add this entry to the port

      <para>Use <varname>DOS2UNIX_REGEX</varname> to convert a group
	of files across subdirectories.  Its argument is a
	&man.find.1;-compatible regular expression.  More on the
	format is in &man.re.format.7;.  This option is useful for
	converting all files of a given extension.  For example,
	convert all source code files, leaving binary files
	intact:</para>

DOS2UNIX_REGEX=	.*\.([ch]|cpp)</programlisting>

      <para>A similar option is <varname>DOS2UNIX_GLOB</varname>,

	in it.</para>

      <programlisting>USES=	dos2unix
DOS2UNIX_GLOB=	*.c *.cpp *.h</programlisting>

      <para>If there are more than one distribution file and some

  <title>Testing the Port</title>

  <sect1 xml:id="make-describe">
    <title>Running <command>make describe</command></title>

    <para>Several of the &os; port maintenance tools, such as
      &man.portupgrade.1;, rely on a database called
      <filename>/usr/ports/INDEX</filename> which keeps track of such
      items as port dependencies.  <filename>INDEX</filename> is
      created by the top-level <filename>ports/Makefile</filename> via
      <command>make index</command>, which descends into each port
      subdirectory and executes <command>make describe</command>
      there.  Thus, if <command>make describe</command> fails in any
      port, no one can generate <filename>INDEX</filename>, and many
      people will quickly become unhappy.</para>

    <note>
      <para>It is important to be able to generate this file no matter
	what options are present in <filename>make.conf</filename>, so
	please avoid doing things such as using
	<literal>.error</literal> statements when (for instance) a
	dependency is not satisfied.  (See
	<xref linkend="dads-dot-error"/>.)</para>
    </note>

    <para>If <command>make describe</command> produces a string rather
      than an error message, everything is probably safe.  See
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> for the meaning of the string
      produced.</para>

    <para>Also note that running a recent version of
      <command>portlint</command> (as specified in the next section)
      will cause <command>make describe</command> to be run
      automatically.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="testing-portlint">
    <title>Portlint</title>

    <para>Do check the port with <link
	linkend="porting-portlint"><command>portlint</command></link>
      before submitting or committing it.  <command>portlint</command>
      warns about many common errors, both functional and
      stylistic.  For a new (or repocopied) port,
      <command>portlint -A</command> is the most thorough; for an
      existing port, <command>portlint -C</command> is
      sufficient.</para>

    <para>Since <command>portlint</command> uses heuristics to try to
      figure out errors, it can produce false positive warnings.  In
      addition, occasionally something that is flagged as a problem
      really cannot be done in any other way due to limitations in the
      ports framework.  When in doubt, the best thing to do is ask on
      &a.ports;.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="testing-porttools">
    <title>Port Tools</title>

    <para>The <package role="port">ports-mgmt/porttools</package>
      program is part of the Ports Collection.</para>

    <para><command>port</command> is the front-end script, which can
      help simplify the testing job.  Whenever a new port or an update
      to an existing one needs testing, use
      <command>port test</command> to test the port, including the
      <link
	linkend="testing-portlint"><command>portlint</command></link>
      checking.  This command also detects and lists any files that
      are not listed in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  For
      example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>port test /usr/ports/net/csup</userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-prefix">
    <title><varname>PREFIX</varname> and
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname></title>

    <para><varname>PREFIX</varname> determines where the port will be
      installed.  It defaults to <filename>/usr/local</filename>, but
      can be set by the user to a custom path like
      <filename>/opt</filename>.  The port must respect the value of
      this variable.</para>

    <para><varname>DESTDIR</varname>, if set by the user, determines
      the complete alternative environment, usually a jail or an
      installed system mounted somewhere other than
      <filename>/</filename>.  A port will actually install into
      <filename>DESTDIR/PREFIX</filename>, and register with the
      package database in <filename>DESTDIR/var/db/pkg</filename>.  As
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname> is handled automatically by the ports
      infrastructure with &man.chroot.8;.  There is no need for
      modifications or any extra care to write
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname>-compliant ports.</para>

    <para>The value of <varname>PREFIX</varname> will be set to
      <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> (defaulting to
      <filename>/usr/local</filename>).  If
      <varname>USE_LINUX_PREFIX</varname> is set,
      <varname>PREFIX</varname> will be <varname>LINUXBASE</varname>
      (defaulting to <filename>/compat/linux</filename>).</para>

    <para>Avoiding hard-coded <filename>/usr/local</filename> paths in
      the source makes the port much more flexible and able to cater
      to the needs of other sites.  Often, this can be accomplished by
      replacing occurrences of <filename>/usr/local</filename>
      in the port's various <filename>Makefile</filename>s with
      <literal>&dollar;{PREFIX}</literal>.  This variable is
      automatically passed down to every stage of the build and
      install processes.</para>

    <para>Make sure the application is not installing things in
      <filename>/usr/local</filename> instead of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>.  A quick test for such hard-coded
      paths is:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make clean; make package PREFIX=/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput></screen>

    <para>If anything is installed outside of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>, the package creation process will
      complain that it cannot find the files.</para>

    <para>In addition, it is worth checking the same with the stage
      directory support (see <xref linkend="staging"/>):</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make stage &amp;&amp; make check-plist &amp;&amp; make stage-qa &amp;&amp; make package</userinput></screen>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><buildtarget>check-plist</buildtarget> checks for files
	  missing from the plist, and files in the plist that are not
	  installed by the port.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><buildtarget>stage-qa</buildtarget> checks for common
	  problems like bad shebang, symlinks pointing outside the
	  stage directory, setuid files, and non-stripped
	  libraries...</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>These tests will not find hard-coded paths inside the port's
      files, nor will it verify that <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is
      being used to correctly refer to files from other ports.  The
      temporarily-installed port in
      <filename>/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</filename> must be
      tested for proper operation to make sure there are no problems
      with paths.</para>

    <para><varname>PREFIX</varname> must not be set explicitly in a
      port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Users installing the port
      may have set <varname>PREFIX</varname> to a custom location, and
      the port must respect that setting.</para>

    <para>Refer to programs and files from other ports with the
      variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For
      instance, if the port requires a macro <literal>PAGER</literal>
      to have the full pathname of <command>less</command>, do not use
      a literal path of <filename>/usr/local/bin/less</filename>.
      Instead, use <literal>&dollar;{LOCALBASE}</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>-DPAGER=\"&dollar;{LOCALBASE}/bin/less\"</programlisting>

    <para>The path with <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is more likely to
      still work if the system administrator has moved the whole
      <filename>/usr/local</filename> tree somewhere else.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>All these tests are done automatically when running
	<command>poudriere testport</command> or <command>poudriere
	  bulk -t</command>.  It is highly recommended that every
	ports contributor install it, and tests all his ports with it.
	See <xref linkend="testing-poudriere"/> for more
	information.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="testing-poudriere">
    <title><application>Poudriere</application></title>

    <para>For a ports contributor,
      <application>Poudriere</application> is one of the most
      important and helpful testing and build tools.  Its main
      features include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Bulk building of the entire ports tree, specific subsets
	  of the ports tree, or a single port including its
	  dependencies</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>Testing for successful ports builds using different
	  options</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Because <application>Poudriere</application> performs its
      building in a clean &man.jail.8; environment and uses
      &man.zfs.8; features, it has several advantages over traditional
      testing on the host system:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>No pollution of the host environment: No leftover files,
	  no accidental removals, no changes of existing configuration
	  files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Verify <filename>pkg-plist</filename> for missing or
	  superfluous entries</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Ports committers sometimes ask for a
	  <application>Poudriere</application> log alongside a patch
	  submission to assess whether the patch is ready for
	  integration into the ports tree</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is also quite straightforward to set up and use, has no
      dependencies, and will run on any supported &os; release.  This
      section shows how to install, configure, and run
      <application>Poudriere</application> as part of the normal
      workflow of a ports contributor.</para>

    <para>The examples in this section show a default file layout, as
      standard in &os;.  Substitute any local changes accordingly.
      The ports tree, represented by <varname>${PORTSDIR}</varname>,
      is located in <filename>/usr/ports</filename>.  Both
      <varname>${LOCALBASE}</varname> and <varname>${PREFIX}</varname>
      are <filename>/usr/local</filename> by default.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="testing-poudriere-installing">
      <title>Installing <application>Poudriere</application></title>

      <para><application>Poudriere</application> is available in the
	ports tree in <package
	  role="port">ports-mgmt/poudriere</package>.  It can be
	installed using &man.pkg.8; or from ports:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install poudriere</userinput></screen>

      <para>or</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/poudriere install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>There is also a work-in-progress version of
	<application>Poudriere</application> which will eventually
	become the next release.  It is available in <package
	  role="port">ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel</package>.  This
	development version is used for the official &os; package
	builds, so it is well tested.  It often has newer interesting
	features.  A ports committer will want to use the development
	version because it is what is used in production, and has all
	the new features that will make sure everything is exactly
	right.  A contributor will not necessarily need those as the
	most important fixes are backported to released version.  The
	main reason for the use of the development version to build
	the official package is because it is faster, in a way that
	will shorten a full build from 18 hours to 17 hours when using
	a high end 32 <acronym>CPU</acronym> server with 128GB of
	<acronym>RAM</acronym>.  Those optimizations will not matter a
	lot when building ports on a desktop machine.</para>

      <title>Setting Up Ports Trees for Use with

      <para>There are multiple ways to use ports trees in
	<application>Poudriere</application>.  The most
	straightforward way is to have
	<application>Poudriere</application> create a default ports
	tree for itself:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere ports -c</userinput></screen>

      <para>This command creates
	<literal>tank/poudriere/ports/default</literal>, mount it on
	<filename>/poudriere/ports/default</filename>, and populate it
	using &man.portsnap.8;.  Afterward it is included in the list
	of known ports trees:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere ports -l</userinput>
PORTSTREE      METHOD     PATH
default        portsnap   /poudriere/ports/default</screen>

      <note>
	<para>Note that the <quote>default</quote> ports tree is
	  special.  Each of the build commands explained later will
	  implicitly use this ports tree unless specifically specified
	  otherwise.  To use another tree, add <command>-p
	    <replaceable>treename</replaceable></command> to the
	  commands.</para>
      </note>

      <para>While useful for regular bulk builds, having this default
	ports tree with the &man.portsnap.8; method may not be the
	best way to deal with local modifications for a ports
	contributor.  As with the creation of jails, it is possible to
	use a different method for creating the ports tree.  To add an
	additional ports tree for testing local modifications and
	ports development, checking out the tree via
	<application>Subversion</application> is possible:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere ports -c -m svn+https -p subversive</userinput></screen>

      <para>Creates <literal>tank/poudriere/ports/subversive</literal>
	and mounts it on
	<filename>/poudriere/ports/subversive</filename>.  It is then
	populated using <application>Subversion</application>.
	Finally, it is added to the list of known ports trees:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere ports -l</userinput>
PORTSTREE            METHOD     PATH
default              portsnap   /poudriere/ports/default
subversive           svn+https  /poudriere/ports/subversive</screen>

      <tip>
	<para>The <literal>svn</literal> method allows extra

      <title>Using Manually Managed Ports Trees with Poudriere</title>

      <para>Depending on the workflow, it can be extremely helpful to

	<filename>/work/ports</filename>, point
	<application>Poudriere</application> to the location:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere ports -c -F -f none -M /work/ports -p development</userinput></screen>

PORTSTREE    METHOD   PATH
development  -        /work/ports</screen>

      <note>
	<para>The dash in the <literal>METHOD</literal> column means
	  that <application>Poudriere</application> will not update or

      <title>Testing Ports</title>

      <para>After jails and ports trees have been set up, the result
	of a contributor's modifications to the ports tree can be
	tested.</para>

      <para>For example, local modifications to the <package
	  role="port">www/firefox</package> port located in
	<filename>/work/ports/www/firefox</filename> can be tested in
	the previously created 9.3-RELEASE jail:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere testport -j 93Ramd64 -p development -o www/firefox</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will build all dependencies of
	<application>Firefox</application>.  If a dependency has been
	built previously and is still up-to-date, the pre-built
	package is installed.  If a dependency has no up-to-date
	package, one will be built with default options in a jail.
	Then <application>Firefox</application> itself is
	built.</para>

      <para>The complete build of every port is logged to
	<filename>/poudriere/data/logs/bulk/93Ri386-development/<replaceable>build-time</replaceable>/logs</filename>.</para>

      <para>The directory name <literal>93Ri386-development</literal>
	is derived from the arguments to <literal>-j</literal> and
	<literal>-p</literal>, respectively.  For convenience, a
	symbolic link
	<filename>/poudriere/data/logs/bulk/93Ri386-development/latest</filename>
	is also maintained.  The link points to the latest
	<replaceable>build-time</replaceable> directory.  Also in this
	directory is an <filename>index.html</filename> for observing
	the build process with a web browser.</para>

      <para>By default, <application>Poudriere</application> cleans up
	the jails and leaves log files in the directories mentioned
	above.  To ease investigation, jails can be kept running after
	the build by adding <option>-i</option> to
	<command>testport</command>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere testport -j 93Ramd64 -p development -i -o www/firefox</userinput></screen>

      <para>After the build completes, and regardless of whether it
	was successful, a shell is provided within the jail.  The
	shell is used to investigate further.
	<application>Poudriere</application> can be told to leave the
	jail running after the build finishes with
	<option>-I</option>.  <application>Poudriere</application>
	will show the command to run when the jail is no longer
	needed.  It is then possible to &man.jexec.8; into it:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere testport -j 93Ramd64 -p development -I -o www/firefox</userinput>
[...]
====>> Installing local Pkg repository to /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
====>> Leaving jail 93Ramd64-development-n running, mounted at /poudriere/data/.m/93Ramd64-development/ref for interactive run testing
====>> To enter jail: jexec 93Ramd64-development-n env -i TERM=$TERM /usr/bin/login -fp root
====>> To stop jail: poudriere jail -k -j 93Ramd64 -p development
&prompt.root; <userinput>jexec 93Ramd64-development-n env -i TERM=$TERM /usr/bin/login -fp root</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><replaceable>[do some stuff in the jail]</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>exit</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere jail -k -j 93Ramd64 -p development</userinput>
====>> Umounting file systems</screen>

      <para>An integral part of the &os; ports build infrastructure is
	the ability to tweak ports to personal preferences with
	options.  These can be tested with
	<application>Poudriere</application> as well.  Adding the
	<option>-c</option>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere testport -c -o www/firefox</userinput></screen>

      <para>Presents the port configuration dialog before the port is
	built.  The ports given after <option>-o</option> in the
	format
	<literal><replaceable>category</replaceable>/<replaceable>portname</replaceable></literal>
	will use the specified options, all dependencies will use the
	default options.  Testing dependent ports with non-default
	options can be accomplished using sets, see <xref
	  linkend="testing-poudriere-sets"/>.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>When testing ports where <filename>pkg-plist</filename>
	  is altered during build depending on the selected options,
	  it is recommended to perform a test run with all options
	  selected <emphasis>and</emphasis> one with all options
	  deselected.</para>
      </tip>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="testing-poudriere-sets">
      <title>Using Sets</title>

      <para>For all actions involving builds, a so-called
	<emphasis>set</emphasis> can be specified using <literal>-z
	  <replaceable>setname</replaceable></literal>.  A set refers
	to a fully independent build.  This allows, for instance,
	usage of <command>testport</command> with non-standard options
	for the dependent ports.</para>

      <para>To use sets, <application>Poudriere</application> expects
	an existing directory structure similar to
	<varname>PORT_DBDIR</varname>, defaults to
	<filename>/var/db/ports</filename> in its configuration
	directory.  This directory is then nullfs-mounted into the
	jails where the ports and their dependencies are built.
	Usually a suitable starting point can be obtained by
	recursively copying the existing <varname>PORT_DBDIR</varname>
	to
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<replaceable>jailname</replaceable>-<replaceable>portname</replaceable>-<replaceable>setname</replaceable>-options</filename>.
	This is described in detail in &man.poudriere.8;.  For
	instance, testing <package role="port">www/firefox</package>
	in a specific set named <literal>devset</literal>, add the
	<literal>-z devset</literal> parameter to the testport
	command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere testport -j 93Ramd64 -p development -z devset -o www/firefox</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will look for the existence of these directories in
	this order:</para>

	directory of the build jails.  Hence, all custom options are
	used for all the ports during this run of
	<command>testport</command>.</para>

      <para>After the directory structure for a set is provided, the
	options for a particular port can be altered.  For
	example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>poudriere options -c www/firefox -z devset</userinput></screen>

      <para>The configuration dialog for <package
	  role="port">www/firefox</package> is shown, and options can
	be edited.  The selected options are saved to the
	<literal>devset</literal> set.</para>

      <note>
	<para><application>Poudriere</application> is very flexible in

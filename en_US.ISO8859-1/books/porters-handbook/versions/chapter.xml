README FIRST:

The format of each entry is:

	  <row>
	    <entry>[version number]</entry>
	    <entry><revnumber>[revision of the bump]</revnumber></entry>
	    <entry>[date of revision]</entry>
	    <entry>[FreeBSD version] [long-ish description of why the version was
	      bumped.]</entry>
	  </row>

The [FreeBSD version] is usually XY-CURRENT or XY-STABLE.

In some cases, the changes described were not committed at the same
time when the version was bumped, in this case, add the revision to
the description, like, for example, for 1200028.

You do not need to add all the extra xml markup in the description
that will make it look better, what is important is to document
things.  Keep in mind though, that this is xml, so if you need a &, it
is spelled &amp;, < is &lt; and > is &gt;.

    <note>
      <para>Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as
	<quote>2.2.5-STABLE</quote> after the 2.2.5-RELEASE.  The
	pattern used to be year followed by the month, but we decided
	to change it to a more straightforward major/minor system
	starting from 2.2.  This is because the parallel development
	on several branches made it infeasible to classify the
	releases merely by their real release dates.  Do not worry
	about old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for
	reference.</para>

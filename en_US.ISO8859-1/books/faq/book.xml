	<question xml:id="what-is-FreeBSD">
	  <para>What is &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>&os; is a modern operating system for desktops,
	    laptops, servers, and embedded systems with support for a
	    large number of  <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/platforms/">platforms</link>.</para>

	  <para>It is based on U.C. Berkeley's
	    <quote>4.4BSD-Lite</quote> release, with some
	    <quote>4.4BSD-Lite2</quote> enhancements.  It is also
	    based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C.
	    Berkeley's <quote>Net/2</quote> to the &i386;, known as
	    <quote>386BSD</quote>, though very little of the 386BSD
	    code remains.</para>

	  <para>&os; is used by companies, Internet Service Providers,
	    researchers, computer professionals, students and home
	    users all over the world in their work, education and
	    recreation.</para>

	  <para>For more detailed information on &os;, refer to the
	    <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">&os;
	      Handbook</link>.</para>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="FreeBSD-goals">
	  <para>What is the goal of the &os; Project?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The goal of the &os; Project is to provide a stable
	    and fast general purpose operating system that may be used
	    for any purpose without strings attached.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="bsd-license-restrictions">
	  <para>Does the &os; license have any restrictions?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Yes.  Those restrictions do not control how the code
	    is used, but how to treat the &os; Project itself.
	    The license itself is available at
	    <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">license</link>
	    and can be summarized like this:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not claim that you wrote this.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not sue us if it breaks.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not remove or modify the license.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Many of us have a significant investment in the
	    project and would certainly not mind a little financial
	    compensation now and then, but we definitely do not insist
	    on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
	    <quote>mission</quote> is to provide code to any and all
	    comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
	    the widest possible use and provides the widest possible
	    benefit.  This, we believe, is one of the most fundamental
	    goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
	    support.</para>

	  <para>Code in our source tree which falls under the <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING">GNU
	      General Public License (GPL)</link> or <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING.LIB">GNU
	      Library General Public License (LGPL)</link> comes with
	    slightly more strings attached, though at least on the
	    side of enforced access rather than the usual opposite.
	    Due to the additional complexities that can evolve in the
	    commercial use of GPL software, we do, however, endeavor
	    to replace such software with submissions under the more
	    relaxed <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">&os;
	      license</link> whenever possible.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="replace-current-OS">
	  <para>Can &os; replace my current operating system?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>For most people, yes.  But this question is not quite
	    that cut-and-dried.</para>

	  <para>Most people do not actually use an operating system.
	    They use applications.  The applications are what really
	    use the operating system.  &os; is designed to provide a
	    robust and full-featured environment for applications.  It
	    supports a wide variety of web browsers, office suites,
	    email readers, graphics programs, programming
	    environments, network servers, and much more.
	    Most of these applications can be
	    managed through the <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/">Ports
	      Collection</link>.</para>

	  <para>If an application is only available on one operating
	    system, that operating system cannot just be replaced.
	    Chances are, there is a very similar application on &os;,
	    however.  As a solid office or Internet server or a
	    reliable workstation, &os; will almost certainly do
	    everything you need.  Many computer users across the
	    world, including both novices and experienced &unix;
	    administrators, use &os; as their only desktop operating
	    system.</para>

	  <para>Users migrating to &os; from another &unix;-like
	    environment will find &os; to be similar.
	    &windows; and &macos; users may be interested in instead
	    using <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.trueos.org">TrueOS</link>, a
	    &os;-based desktop distribution.  Non-&unix; users should
	    expect to invest some additional time learning the
	    &unix; way of doing things.  This <acronym>FAQ</acronym>
	    and the <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">&os;
	      Handbook</link> are excellent places to start.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="why-called-FreeBSD">
	  <para>Why is it called &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>It may be used free of charge, even by commercial
		users.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Full source for the operating system is freely
		available, and the minimum possible restrictions have
		been placed upon its use, distribution and
		incorporation into other work (commercial or
		non-commercial).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Anyone who has an improvement or bug fix is free
		to submit their code and have it added to the source
		tree (subject to one or two obvious
		provisions).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>It is worth pointing out that the word
	    <quote>free</quote> is being used in two ways here: one
	    meaning <quote>at no cost</quote> and the other meaning
	    <quote>do whatever you like</quote>.  Apart from
	    one or two things you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> do with
	    the &os; code, for example pretending you wrote it, you
	    can really do whatever you like with it.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="differences-to-other-bsds">
	  <para>What are the differences between &os; and NetBSD,
	    OpenBSD, and other open source BSD operating
	    systems?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>James Howard wrote a good explanation of the history
	    and differences between the various projects, called <link
	      xlink:href="https://jameshoward.us/archive/the-bsd-family-tree/">The
	      BSD Family Tree</link> which goes a fair way to
	    answering this question.  Some of the information is out
	    of date, but the history portion in particular remains
	    accurate.</para>

	  <para>Most of the BSDs share patches and code, even today.
	    All of the BSDs have common ancestry.</para>

	  <para>The design goals of &os; are described in <xref
	      linkend="FreeBSD-goals"/>, above.  The design goals of
	    the other most popular BSDs may be summarized as
	    follows:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>OpenBSD aims for operating system security above
		all else.  The OpenBSD team wrote &man.ssh.1; and
		&man.pf.4;, which have both been ported to
		&os;.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>NetBSD aims to be easily ported to other hardware
		platforms.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>DragonFly&nbsp;BSD is a fork of &os;&nbsp;4.8 that
		has since developed many interesting features of its
		own, including the HAMMER file system and support for
		user-mode <quote>vkernels</quote>.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="latest-version">
	  <para>What is the latest version of &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>At any point in the development of &os;, there can be
	    multiple parallel branches.  &rel.relx; releases are made
	    from the &rel.stable; branch, and &rel2.relx; releases are
	    made from the &rel2.stable; branch.</para>

	  <para>Up until the release of 9.0, the &rel2.relx; series
	    was the one known as <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>.
	    However, as of &rel.head.relx;, the &rel2.relx; branch
	    will be designated for an <quote>extended support</quote>
	    status and receive only fixes for major problems, such as
	    security-related fixes.
	    <!--There will be no more releases made from the
	    &rel2.stable; branch, and it is considered a
	    <quote>legacy</quote> branch and most current work will only
	    become a part of &rel.stable; and &rel2.stable;.--></para>

	  <para>Version <link
	      xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">&rel.current;</link>
	    is the latest release from the &rel.stable; branch; it was
	    released in &rel.current.date;.  Version <link
	      xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel2.current;-RELEASE/">&rel2.current;</link>
	    is the latest release from the &rel2.stable; branch; it
	    was released in &rel2.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>Releases are made <link linkend="release-freq">every
	      few months</link>.  While many people stay more
	    up-to-date with the &os; sources (see the questions on
	    <link linkend="current">&os.current;</link> and <link
	      linkend="stable">&os.stable;</link>) than that, doing so
	    is more of a commitment, as the sources are a moving
	    target.</para>

	  <para>More information on &os; releases can be found on the
	    <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html#release-build">Release
	      Engineering page</link> and in &man.release.7;.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="current">
	  <para>What is <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">&os.current;</link>
	    is the development version of the operating system, which
	    will in due course become the new &os.stable; branch.  As
	    such, it is really only of interest to developers working
	    on the system and die-hard hobbyists.  See the <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">relevant
	      section</link> in the <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">Handbook</link>
	    for details on running
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>Users not familiar with &os; should not use
	    &os.current;.  This branch sometimes evolves quite quickly
	    and due to mistake can be un-buildable at times.  People
	    that use &os.current; are expected to be able to analyze,
	    debug, and report problems.</para>

	  <para>&os; <link
	      xlink:href="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</link>
	    releases are made based on the current state of the
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> and
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branches.  The goals behind
	    each snapshot release are:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>To test the latest version of the installation
		software.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To give people who would like to run
		<emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> or
		<emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> but who do not have the
		time or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day basis
		an easy way of bootstrapping it onto their
		systems.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code
		in question, just in case we break something really
		badly later.  (Although Subversion normally prevents
		anything horrible like this happening.)</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To ensure that all new features and fixes in need
		of testing have the greatest possible number of
		potential testers.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>No claims are made that any
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot can be considered
	    <quote>production quality</quote> for any purpose.
	    If a stable and fully tested system is needed,
	    stick to full releases.</para>

	  <para>Snapshot releases are directly available from <link
	      xlink:href="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</link>.</para>

	  <para>Official snapshots are generated on a regular
	    basis for all actively developed branches.</para>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="stable">
	  <para>What is the <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis>
	    concept?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Back when &os;&nbsp;2.0.5 was released, &os;
	    development branched in two.  One branch was named <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#stable">-STABLE</link>,
	    one <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">-CURRENT</link>.
	    <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis> is the development branch
	    from which major releases are made.  Changes go into this
	    branch at a slower pace and with the general assumption
	    that they have first been tested in &os;-CURRENT.
	    However, at any given time, the sources for &os;-STABLE
	    may or may not be suitable for general use, as it may
	    uncover bugs and corner cases that were not yet found in
	    &os;-CURRENT.  Users who do not have the resources to
	    perform testing should instead run the most recent release
	    of &os;.
	    <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>, on the other hand, has
	    been one unbroken line since 2.0 was released, leading
	    towards &rel.current;-RELEASE and beyond.  For more
	    detailed information on branches see <quote><link
	      xlink:href="&url.articles.releng;/release-proc.html#rel-branch">&os;
	      Release Engineering: Creating the Release
	      Branch</link></quote>, the status of the branches and
	      the upcoming release schedule can be found on the <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releng">Release
	      Engineering Information</link> page.</para>

	  <para>&rel.current;-STABLE is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branch.  The latest release
	    on the &rel.current;-STABLE branch is
	    &rel.current;-RELEASE, which was released in
	    &rel.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>The &rel.head; branch is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> branch toward the next
	    generation of &os;.  See <link linkend="current">What is
	    &os;-CURRENT?</link> for more information on this
	    branch.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="release-freq">
	  <para>When are &os; releases made?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &a.re; releases a new major version of &os; about
	    every 18 months and a new minor version about every 8
	    months, on average.  Release dates are announced well in
	    advance, so that the people working on the system know
	    when their projects need to be finished and tested.  A
	    testing period precedes each release, to ensure that the
	    addition of new features does not compromise the stability
	    of the release.  Many users regard this caution as one of
	    the best things about &os;, even though waiting for all
	    the latest goodies to reach <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>
	    can be a little frustrating.</para>

	  <para>More information on the release engineering process
	    (including a schedule of upcoming releases) can be found
	    on the <link
	      xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html">release
	      engineering</link> pages on the &os; Web site.</para>

	  <para>For people who need or want a little more excitement,
	    binary snapshots are made weekly as discussed
	    above.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="responsible">
	  <para>Who is responsible for &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The key decisions concerning the &os; project, such as
	    the overall direction of the project and who is allowed to
	    add code to the source tree, are made by a <link
	      xlink:href="&url.base;/administration.html#t-core">core
	      team</link> of 9 people.  There is a much larger team of
	    more than 350 <link
	      xlink:href="&url.articles.contributors;/article.html#staff-committers">committers</link>
	    who are authorized to make changes directly to the &os;
	    source tree.</para>

	  <para>However, most non-trivial changes are discussed in
	    advance in the <link linkend="mailing">mailing
	      lists</link>, and there are no restrictions on who may
	    take part in the discussion.</para>

	  <para>Some FTP clients default their transfer mode to

	<question xml:id="ffs-limits">
	  <para>What are the limits for FFS file systems?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>For FFS file systems, the largest file system is
	    practically limited by the amount of memory required to
	    &man.fsck.8; the file system.  &man.fsck.8; requires one
	    bit per fragment, which with the default fragment size of
	    4&nbsp;KB equates to 32&nbsp;MB of memory per TB of disk.
	    This does mean that on architectures which limit userland
	    processes to 2&nbsp;GB (e.g., &i386;), the maximum
	    &man.fsck.8;'able filesystem is ~60&nbsp;TB.</para>

	  <para>If there was not a &man.fsck.8; memory limit the
	    maximum filesystem size would be 2&nbsp;^&nbsp;64 (blocks)
	    * 32&nbsp;KB => 16 Exa * 32&nbsp;KB => 512
	    ZettaBytes.</para>

	  <para>The maximum size of a single FFS file is approximately
	    2&nbsp;PB with the default block size of 32&nbsp;KB.  Each
	    32&nbsp;KB block can point to 4096 blocks.  With triple
	    indirect blocks, the calculation is 32&nbsp;KB * 12 +
	    32&nbsp;KB * 4096 + 32&nbsp;KB * 4096^2 + 32&nbsp;KB *
	    4096^3.  Increasing the block size to 64&nbsp;KB will

	      4&nbsp;GB of memory (and usually less than that because

	      platforms support up to 4&nbsp;TB of physical

	  <question xml:id="memory-i386-over-4gb">
	    <para>Why does &os; report less than 4&nbsp;GB memory when
	      installed on an &i386; machine?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The total address space on &i386; machines is
	      32-bit, meaning that at most 4&nbsp;GB of memory is
	      addressable (can be accessed).  Furthermore, some
	      addresses in this range are reserved by hardware for
	      different purposes, for example for using and
	      controlling PCI devices, for accessing video memory, and
	      so on.  Therefore, the total amount of memory usable by
	      the operating system for its kernel and applications is
	      limited to significantly less than 4&nbsp;GB.  Usually,
	      3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB is the maximum usable
	      physical memory in this configuration.</para>

	    <para>To access more than 3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB of
	      installed memory (meaning up to 4&nbsp;GB but also more
	      than 4&nbsp;GB), a special tweak called
	      <acronym>PAE</acronym> must be used.  PAE stands for
	      Physical Address Extension and is a way for 32-bit x86
	      CPUs to address more than 4&nbsp;GB of memory.  It
	      remaps the memory that would otherwise be overlaid by
	      address reservations for hardware devices above the
	      4&nbsp;GB range and uses it as additional physical
	      memory (see &man.pae.4;).  Using PAE has some drawbacks;
	      this mode of memory access is a little bit slower than
	      the normal (without PAE) mode and loadable modules (see
	      &man.kld.4;) are not supported.  This means all drivers
	      must be compiled into the kernel.</para>

	    <para>The most common way to enable PAE is to build a new
	      kernel with the special ready-provided kernel
	      configuration file called <filename>PAE</filename>,
	      which is already configured to build a safe kernel.
	      Note that some entries in this kernel configuration file
	      are too conservative and some drivers marked as unready
	      to be used with PAE are actually usable.  A rule of
	      thumb is that if the driver is usable on 64-bit
	      architectures (like AMD64), it is also usable with PAE.
	      When creating a custom kernel configuration
	      file, PAE can be enabled by adding the following
	      line:</para>

	    <programlisting>options       PAE</programlisting>

	    <para>PAE is not much used nowadays because most new x86
	      hardware also supports running in 64-bit mode, known as
	      AMD64 or &intel;&nbsp;64.  It has a much larger address
	      space and does not need such tweaks.  &os; supports
	      AMD64 and it is recommended that this version of &os; be
	      used instead of the &i386; version if 4&nbsp;GB or more
	      memory is required.</para>

	<question xml:id="pae">
	  <para>Why is &os; finding the wrong amount of memory on
	    &i386; hardware?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The most likely reason is the difference between
	    physical memory addresses and virtual addresses.</para>

	  <para>The convention for most PC hardware is to use the
	    memory area between 3.5&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB for a
	    special purpose (usually for PCI).  This address space is
	    used to access PCI hardware.  As a result real, physical
	    memory cannot be accessed by that address space.</para>

	  <para>What happens to the memory that should appear in that
	    location is hardware dependent.  Unfortunately,
	    some hardware does nothing and the ability to use that
	    last 500&nbsp;MB of RAM is entirely lost.</para>

	  <para>Luckily, most hardware remaps the memory to a higher
	    location so that it can still be used.  However, this can
	    cause some confusion when watching the boot
	    messages.</para>

	  <para>On a 32-bit version of &os;, the memory appears lost,
	    since it will be remapped above 4&nbsp;GB, which a 32-bit
	    kernel is unable to access.  In this case, the solution is
	    to build a PAE enabled kernel.  See the entry on memory
	    limits for more information.</para>

	  <para>On a 64-bit version of &os;, or when running a
	    PAE-enabled kernel, &os; will correctly detect and remap
	    the memory so it is usable.  During boot, however, it may
	    seem as if &os; is detecting more memory than the system
	    really has, due to the described remapping.  This is
	    normal and the available memory will be corrected as the
	    boot process completes.</para>

	<question xml:id="signal11">
	  <para>Why do my programs occasionally die with
	    <errorname>Signal 11</errorname> errors?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Signal 11 errors are caused when a process has
	    attempted to access memory which the operating system has
	    not granted it access to.  If something like this is
	    happening at seemingly random intervals,
	    start investigating the cause.</para>

	  <para>These problems can usually be attributed to
	    either:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem is occurring only in a specific
		custom application, it is
		probably a bug in the code.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If it is a problem with part of the base &os;
		system, it may also be buggy code, but more often than
		not these problems are found and fixed long before us
		general <acronym>FAQ</acronym> readers get to use
		these bits of code (that is what -CURRENT is
		for).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>It is probably
	    not a &os; bug if the
	    problem occurs compiling a program, but the activity
	    that the compiler is carrying out changes each
	    time.</para>

	  <para>For example, if <command>make
	      buildworld</command> fails while trying
	    to compile <filename>ls.c</filename> into
	    <filename>ls.o</filename> and, when run again, it fails
	    in the same place, this is a broken build.  Try
	    updating source and try again.  If the compile fails
	    elsewhere, it is almost certainly due to hardware.</para>

	  <para>In the first case, use a debugger such as
	    &man.gdb.1; to find the point in the program which is
	    attempting to access a bogus address and fix
	    it.</para>

	  <para>In the second case, verify which piece of
	    hardware is at fault.</para>

	  <para>Common causes of this include:</para>

		the fans are still working, as the disk and
		other hardware might be overheating.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>The processor running is overheating: This might
		be because the processor has been overclocked, or the
		fan on the processor might have died.  In either case,
		ensure that the hardware is running at
		what it is specified to run at, at least while trying
		to solve this problem.  If it is not, clock it back
		to the default settings.)</para>

	      <para>Regarding overclocking, it is far

		needs replacing!  Also the community is not

	  <para>What is the meaning of the error <errorname>maxproc
	      limit exceeded by uid %i, please see tuning(7) and
	      login.conf(5)</errorname>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; kernel will only allow a certain number of
	    processes to exist at one time.  The number is based on
	    the <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> &man.sysctl.8;
	    variable.  <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> also affects
	    various other in-kernel limits, such as network buffers.
	    If the machine is heavily loaded,
	    increase <varname>kern.maxusers</varname>.  This will
	    increase these other system limits in addition to the
	    maximum number of processes.</para>

	  <para>To adjust the <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> value,
	    see the <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/configtuning-kernel-limits.html#kern-maxfiles">File/Process
	      Limits</link> section of the Handbook.  While that
	    section refers to open files, the same limits apply to
	    processes.</para>

	  <para>If the machine is lightly loaded but running a very
	    large number of processes, adjust the
	    <varname>kern.maxproc</varname> tunable by defining it in
	    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The tunable will
	    not get adjusted until the system is rebooted.  For more
	    information about tuning tunables, see
	    &man.loader.conf.5;.  If these processes are being run by
	    a single user, adjust
	    <varname>kern.maxprocperuid</varname> to be one less than
	    the new <varname>kern.maxproc</varname> value.  It must
	    be at least one less because one system program,
	    &man.init.8;, must always be running.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The remote machine may be setting the terminal type to
	    something other than <literal>xterm</literal> which is
	    required by the &os; console.  Alternatively the kernel
	    may have the wrong values for the width and height of the
	    terminal.</para>

	  <para>Check the value of the <envar>TERM</envar>
	    environment variable is <literal>xterm</literal>.  If the
	    remote machine does not support that try
	    <literal>vt100</literal>.</para>

	  <para>Run <command>stty -a</command> to check what the

	    <replaceable>CC</replaceable></command>.</para>

	  <para>Alternatively, if the client machine has

	<question xml:id="connection-delay">
	  <para>Why does it take so long to connect to my computer via
	    <command>ssh</command> or
	    <command>telnet</command>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The symptom: there is a long delay between the time
	    the TCP connection is established and the time when the
	    client software asks for a password (or, in
	    &man.telnet.1;'s case, when a login prompt
	    appears).</para>

	  <para>The problem: more likely than not, the delay is caused
	    by the server software trying to resolve the client's IP
	    address into a hostname.  Many servers, including the
	    <application>Telnet</application> and
	    <application>SSH</application> servers that come with
	    &os;, do this to store the hostname in a log file for
	    future reference by the administrator.</para>

	  <para>The remedy: if the problem occurs whenever connecting
	    the client computer to any server, the problem
	    is with the client.  If the problem only occurs
	    when someone connects to the server computer, the
	    problem is with the server.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the client, the only remedy is
	    to fix the DNS so the server can resolve it.  If this is
	    on a local network, consider it a server problem and keep
	    reading.  If this is on the Internet,
	    contact your ISP.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the server on a
	    local network, configure the server
	    to resolve address-to-hostname queries for the local
	    address range.  See &man.hosts.5; and &man.named.8;
	    for more information.  If this is on the
	    Internet, the problem may be that the local server's
	    resolver is not functioning correctly.  To check, try to
	    look up another host such as
	    <systemitem>www.yahoo.com</systemitem>.  If it does not
	    work, that is the problem.</para>

	  <para>Following a fresh install of &os;, it is also possible
	    that domain and name server information is missing from
	    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  This will often
	    cause a delay in <application>SSH</application>, as the
	    option <literal>UseDNS</literal> is set to
	    <literal>yes</literal> by default in
	    <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>.  If this is
	    causing the problem, either fill in the
	    missing information in
	    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> or set
	    <literal>UseDNS</literal> to <literal>no</literal> in
	    <filename>sshd_config</filename> as a temporary

	<question xml:id="lock-order-reversal">
	  <para>What is a <errorname>lock order
	      reversal</errorname>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; kernel uses a number of resource locks to
	    arbitrate contention for certain resources.  When multiple
	    kernel threads try to obtain multiple resource locks,
	    there's always the potential for a deadlock, where two
	    threads have each obtained one of the locks and blocks
	    forever waiting for the other thread to release one of the
	    other locks.  This sort of locking problem can be avoided
	    if all threads obtain the locks in the same order.</para>

	  <para>A run-time lock diagnostic system called
	    &man.witness.4;, enabled in &os.current; and disabled by
	    default for stable branches and releases, detects the
	    potential for deadlocks due to locking errors, including
	    errors caused by obtaining multiple resource locks with a
	    different order from different parts of the kernel.  The
	    &man.witness.4; framework tries to detect this problem as
	    it happens, and reports it by printing a message to the
	    system console about a <errorname>lock order
	      reversal</errorname> (often referred to also as
	    <acronym>LOR</acronym>).</para>

	  <para>It is possible to get false positives, as
	    &man.witness.4; is conservative.  A true positive report
	    <emphasis>does not</emphasis> mean that a system is
	    dead-locked; instead it should be understood as a warning
	    that a deadlock could have happened here.</para>

	  <para>What does <errorname>Called ...  with the following
	      non-sleepable locks held</errorname> mean?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This means that a function that may sleep was called
	    while a mutex (or other unsleepable) lock was held.</para>

	  <para>The reason this is an error is because mutexes are not
	    intended to be held for long periods of time; they are
	    supposed to only be held to maintain short periods of
	    synchronization.  This programming contract allows device
	    drivers to use mutexes to synchronize with the rest of the
	    kernel during interrupts.  Interrupts (under &os;) may not
	    sleep.  Hence it is imperative that no subsystem in the
	    kernel block for an extended period while holding a
	    mutex.</para>

	  <para>To catch such errors, assertions may be added to the
	    kernel that interact with the &man.witness.4; subsystem to
	    emit a warning or fatal error (depending on the system
	    configuration) when a potentially blocking call is made
	    while holding a mutex.</para>

	  <para>In summary, such warnings are non-fatal, however with
	    unfortunate timing they could cause undesirable effects
	    ranging from a minor blip in the system's responsiveness
	    to a complete system lockup.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Many people need to write shell scripts which will be
	    portable across many systems.  That is why &posix;
	    specifies the shell and utility commands in great detail.
	    Most scripts are written in Bourne shell (&man.sh.1;), and
	    because several important programming interfaces
	    (&man.make.1;, &man.system.3;, &man.popen.3;, and
	    analogues in higher-level scripting languages like Perl
	    and Tcl) are specified to use the Bourne shell to
	    interpret commands.  Because the Bourne shell is so often
	    and widely used, it is important for it to be quick to
	    start, be deterministic in its behavior, and have a small
	    memory footprint.</para>

	  <para>The existing implementation is our best effort at
	    meeting as many of these requirements simultaneously as we
	    can.  To keep <command>/bin/sh</command> small, we have
	    not provided many of the convenience features that other
	    shells have.  That is why other more featureful shells
	    like <command>bash</command>, <command>scsh</command>,
	    &man.tcsh.1;, and <command>zsh</command> are available.
	    Compare the memory utilization of
	    these shells by looking at the <quote>VSZ</quote> and

	  <para>Why is my kernel so big?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><literal>GENERIC</literal> kernels shipped with &os;
	    are compiled in <emphasis>debug mode</emphasis>.
	    Kernels built in debug mode contain debug data in
	    separate files that are used for debugging.
	    &os; releases prior to 11.0 store these debug files in
	    the same directory as the kernel itself,
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/</filename>.
	    In &os; 11.0 and later the debug files are stored in
	    <filename>/usr/lib/debug/boot/kernel/</filename>.
	    Note that there will be little or no performance loss from
	    running a debug kernel, and it is useful to keep one
	    around in case of a system panic.</para>

	  <para>When running low on disk space, there
	    are different options to reduce the size of
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/</filename> and
	    <filename>/usr/lib/debug/</filename>.</para>

	  <para>To not install the symbol files,
	    make sure the following line exists in
	    <filename>/etc/src.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS=yes</programlisting>

	  <para>For more information see &man.src.conf.5;.</para>

	  <para>If you want to avoid building debug files altogether,
	    make sure that both of the following are true:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This line does not exist in the kernel

	      <programlisting>makeoptions DEBUG=-g</programlisting>

	      <para>Do not run &man.config.8; with
		<option>-g</option>.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Either of the above settings will cause the kernel to
	    be built in debug mode.</para>

	  <para>To build and install only the specified modules, list
	    them in
	    <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>MODULES_OVERRIDE= <replaceable>accf_http ipfw</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>Replace <emphasis>accf_httpd ipfw</emphasis> with a
	    list of needed modules.  Only the listed modules will be
	    built.  This reduces the size of the kernel
	    directory and decreases the amount of time needed to
	    build the kernel.  For more information, read
	    <filename>/usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Unneeded devices can be removed from the kernel

	<question xml:id="new-huge-disk">
	  <para>How do I move my system over to my huge new
	    disk?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The best way is to reinstall the operating system on
	    the new disk, then move the user data over.  This is
	    highly recommended when tracking
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> for more than one release or
	    when updating a release instead of installing a new one.
	    Install booteasy on both disks with &man.boot0cfg.8; and
	    dual boot until you are happy with the new configuration.
	    Skip the next paragraph to find out how to move the data
	    after doing this.</para>

	  <para>Alternatively, partition and label the new disk with
	    either &man.sade.8; or &man.gpart.8;.  If the disks are
	    MBR-formatted, booteasy can be installed on both disks
	    with &man.boot0cfg.8; so that the computer can dual boot
	    to the old or new system after the copying is done.</para>

	  <para>Once the new disk set up,
	    the data cannot just be copied.  Instead, use tools that
	    understand device files and system flags, such as
	    &man.dump.8;.  Although it is recommended
	    to move the data while in single-user mode, it
	    is not required.</para>

	  <para>When the disks are formatted with
	    <acronym>UFS</acronym>, never use anything but
	    &man.dump.8; and &man.restore.8; to move the root file
	    system.  These commands should also be used when moving a
	    single partition to another empty partition.  The sequence
	    of steps to use <command>dump</command> to move the data
	    from one <acronym>UFS</acronym> partitions to a new
	    partition is:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para><command>newfs</command> the new partition.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>mount</command> it on a temporary mount
		point.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>cd</command> to that directory.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>dump</command> the old partition, piping
		output to the new one.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>For example, to move
	    <filename>/dev/ada1s1a</filename> with
	    <filename>/mnt</filename> as the temporary mount point,
	    type:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Rearranging partitions with
	    <command>dump</command> takes a bit more work.  To merge a
	    partition like <filename>/var</filename> into its parent,
	    create the new partition large enough for both, move the
	    parent partition as described above, then move the child
	    partition into the empty directory that the first move
	    created:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - /var | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>To split a directory from its parent, say putting
	    <filename>/var</filename> on its own partition when it was
	    not before, create both partitions, then mount the child
	    partition on the appropriate directory in the temporary
	    mount point, then move the old single partition:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1d</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /mnt/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1d /mnt/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The &man.cpio.1; and &man.pax.1; utilities are also
	    available for moving user data.  These are known to lose
	    file flag information, so use them with caution.</para>

	<question xml:id="safe-softupdates">
	  <para>Which partitions can safely use Soft Updates?  I have
	    heard that Soft Updates on <filename>/</filename> can
	    cause problems.  What about Journaled Soft Updates?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: Soft Updates can usually be safely used
	    on all partitions.</para>

	  <para>Long answer:  Soft Updates has two characteristics
	    that may be undesirable on certain partitions.  First, a
	    Soft Updates partition has a small chance of losing data
	    during a system crash.  The partition will not be
	    corrupted as the data will simply be lost.  Second, Soft
	    Updates can cause temporary space shortages.</para>

	  <para>When using Soft Updates, the kernel can take up to
	    thirty seconds to write changes to the physical disk.
	    When a large file is deleted the file still resides on
	    disk until the kernel actually performs the deletion.
	    This can cause a very simple race condition.  Suppose
	    one large file is deleted and another large file is
	    immediately created.  The first large file is not yet
	    actually removed from the physical disk, so the disk might
	    not have enough room for the second large file.  This will
	    produce an error that the partition does not have enough
	    space, even though a large chunk of space has just been
	    released.  A few seconds later, the file creation works as
	    expected.</para>

	  <para>If a system should crash after the kernel accepts a
	    chunk of data for writing to disk, but before that data is
	    actually written out, data could be lost.  This risk is
	    extremely small, but generally manageable.</para>

	  <para>These issues affect all partitions using Soft Updates.
	    So, what does this mean for the root partition?</para>

	  <para>Vital information on the root partition changes very
	    rarely.  If the system crashed during the thirty-second
	    window after such a change is made, it is possible that
	    data could be lost.  This risk is negligible for most
	    applications, but be aware that it exists.  If
	    the system cannot tolerate this much risk, do not use
	    Soft Updates on the root file system!</para>

	  <para><filename>/</filename> is traditionally one of the
	    smallest partitions.  If
	    <filename>/tmp</filename> is on
	    <filename>/</filename>, there may be intermittent
	    space problems.  Symlinking <filename>/tmp</filename> to
	    <filename>/var/tmp</filename> will solve this
	    problem.</para>

	  <para>Finally, &man.dump.8; does not work in live mode (-L)

	<question xml:id="du-vs-df">
	  <para>The <command>du</command> and <command>df</command>
	    commands show different amounts of disk space available.
	    What is going on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is due to how these commands actually work.
	    <command>du</command> goes through the directory tree,
	    measures how large each file is, and presents the totals.
	    <command>df</command> just asks the file system how much
	    space it has left.  They seem to be the same thing, but a
	    file without a directory entry will affect
	    <command>df</command> but not
	    <command>du</command>.</para>

	  <para>When a program is using a file, and the file is
	    deleted, the file is not really removed from the file
	    system until the program stops using it.  The file is
	    immediately deleted from the directory listing, however.
	    As an example, consider a file large enough
	    to affect the output of
	    <command>du</command> and <command>df</command>.  A
	    file being viewed with <command>more</command> can be
	    deleted wihout causing an error.
	    The entry is
	    removed from the directory so no other program or user can
	    access it.  However, <command>du</command> shows that it
	    is gone as it has walked the directory tree and the
	    file is not listed.  <command>df</command> shows that it
	    is still there, as the file system knows that
	    <command>more</command> is still using that space.  Once
	    the <command>more</command> session ends,
	    <command>du</command> and <command>df</command> will
	    agree.</para>

	  <para>This situation is common on web servers.  Many people
	    set up a &os; web server and forget to rotate the log
	    files.  The access log fills up <filename>/var</filename>.
	    The new administrator deletes the file, but the system
	    still complains that the partition is full.  Stopping and
	    restarting the web server program would free the file,
	    allowing the system to release the disk space.  To prevent
	    this from happening, set up &man.newsyslog.8;.</para>

	  <para>Note that Soft Updates can delay the freeing of disk
	    space and it can take up to 30 seconds for the

	<answer>
	  <para>The <acronym>ZIL</acronym> (<acronym>ZFS</acronym>
	    intent log) is a write log used to implement posix write
	    commitment semantics across crashes.  Normally writes are
	    bundled up into transaction groups and written to disk
	    when filled (<quote>Transaction Group Commit</quote>).
	    However syscalls like &man.fsync.2; require a commitment
	    that the data is written to stable storage before
	    returning.  The ZIL is needed for writes that have been
	    acknowledged as written but which are not yet on disk as
	    part of a transaction.  The transaction groups are
	    timestamped.  In the event of a crash the last valid

	<answer>
	  <para>Generally speaking, no.</para>

	  <para>Deduplication takes up a significant amount of RAM and
	    may slow down read and write disk access times.  Unless

	    consideration is the inability to revert deduplication

	    disabling dedup will not cause those blocks which were
	    deduplicated to be replicated until they are next

	  <para>This is normally caused by editing the system crontab.
	    This is not the correct way to do things as the system
	    crontab has a different format to the per-user crontabs.
	    The system

	    <emphasis>-RC</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>!  What is going
	    on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: it is just a name.
	    <emphasis>RC</emphasis> stands for <quote>Release
	      Candidate</quote>.  It signifies that a release is
	    imminent.  In &os;, <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis> is
	    typically synonymous with the code freeze before a
	    release.  (For some releases, the
	    <emphasis>-BETA</emphasis> label was used in the same way
	    as <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>.)</para>

	  <para>Long answer: &os; derives its releases from one of two
	    places.  Major, dot-zero, releases, such as 9.0-RELEASE
	    are branched from the head of the development stream,
	    commonly referred to as <link
	      linkend="current">-CURRENT</link>.  Minor releases, such
	    as 6.3-RELEASE or 5.2-RELEASE, have been snapshots of the
	    active <link linkend="stable">-STABLE</link> branch.
	    Starting with 4.3-RELEASE, each release also now has its
	    own branch which can be tracked by people requiring an
	    extremely conservative rate of development (typically only
	    security advisories).</para>

	  <para>When a release is about to be made, the branch from
	    which it will be derived from has to undergo a certain
	    process.  Part of this process is a code freeze.  When a
	    code freeze is initiated, the name of the branch is
	    changed to reflect that it is about to become a release.
	    For example, if the branch used to be called 6.2-STABLE,
	    its name will be changed to 6.3-PRERELEASE to signify the
	    code freeze and signify that extra pre-release testing
	    should be happening.  Bug fixes can still be committed to
	    be part of the release.  When the source code is in shape
	    for the release the name will be changed to 6.3-RC to
	    signify that a release is about to be made from it.  Once
	    in the RC stage, only the most critical bugs found can be
	    fixed.  Once the release (6.3-RELEASE in this example) and
	    release branch have been made, the branch will be renamed
	    to 6.3-STABLE.</para>

	  <para>No, there is no memory leak, and it is not using

	  <para>Pages are most often written to disk (sort of a VM
	    sync) when they are in the inactive state, but active
	    pages can also be synced.  This depends upon the CPU
	    tracking of the modified bit being available, and in
	    certain situations there can be an advantage for a block
	    of VM pages to be synced, whether they are active or
	    inactive.  In most common cases, it is best to think of
	    the inactive queue to be a queue of relatively unused
	    pages that might or might not be in the process of being
	    written to disk.  Cached pages are already synced, not
	    mapped, but available for immediate process use with their
	    old association or with a new association.  Free pages are
	    available at interrupt level, but cached or free pages can
	    be used at process state for reuse.  Cache pages are not
	    adequately locked to be available at interrupt
	    level.</para>

	<question xml:id="free-memory-amount">
	  <para>How much free memory is available?</para>
	</question>

	<!-- Provided by John Dyson via Usenet -->
	<answer>
	  <para>There are a couple of kinds of <quote>free
	      memory</quote>.  One kind is the amount of memory
	    immediately available without paging anything else out.
	    That is approximately the size of cache queue + size of
	    free queue (with a derating factor, depending upon system
	    tuning).  Another kind of <quote>free memory</quote> is
	    the total amount of <acronym>VM</acronym> space.  That can
	    be complex, but is dependent upon the amount of swap space
	    and memory.  Other kinds of <quote>free memory</quote>
	    descriptions are also possible, but it is relatively
	    useless to define these, but rather it is important to
	    make sure that the paging rate is kept low, and to avoid
	    running out of swap space.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>When using &man.syscons.4;, the default console
	    driver, &os; can be configured to support a mouse pointer
	    on each virtual screen.  To avoid conflicting with X,
	    &man.syscons.4; supports a virtual device called
	    <filename>/dev/sysmouse</filename>.  All mouse events
	    received from the real mouse device are written to the

	  <para>What is a virtual console and how do I make

	<answer>
	  <para>Virtual consoles provide
	    several simultaneous sessions on the same machine without
	    doing anything complicated like setting up a network or
	    running X.</para>

	  <para>When the system starts, it will display a login prompt
	    on the monitor after displaying all the boot messages.
	    Type in your login name and password to
	    start working on the first virtual
	    console.</para>

	  <para>To start another
	    session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program
	    or to read mail while waiting for an
	    FTP transfer to finish,
	    hold down <keycap>Alt</keycap> and press
	    <keycap>F2</keycap>.  This will display the login prompt
	    for the second virtual
	      console.  To go back to the
	    original session, press <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

	  <para>The default &os; installation has eight virtual
	    consoles enabled.  <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F3</keycap></keycombo>,
	    and so on will switch between these virtual
	    consoles.</para>

	  <para>To enable more of virtual consoles, edit
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;) and add
	    entries for <filename>ttyv8</filename> to
	    <filename>ttyvc</filename>, after the comment on
	    <quote>Virtual terminals</quote>:</para>

	  <programlisting># Edit the existing entry for ttyv8 in /etc/ttys and change
# "off" to "on".
ttyv8   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure

ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure
ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure</programlisting>

	  <para>The more virtual
	    terminals, the more resources that are used.  This can be
	    problematic on systems with 8&nbsp;MB RAM or less.
	    Consider changing <literal>secure</literal> to
	    <literal>insecure</literal>.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>In order to run an X server, at least one virtual
	      terminal must be left to <literal>off</literal> for it
	      to use.  This means that only eleven of the Alt-function
	      keys can be used as virtual consoles so that one is left
	      for the X server.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>For example, to run X and eleven virtual consoles, the
	    setting for virtual terminal 12 should be:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  off secure</programlisting>

	<question xml:id="xdm-boot">
	  <para>How do I start <application>XDM</application> on
	    boot?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There are two schools of thought on how to start
	    &man.xdm.1;.  One school starts <command>xdm</command>
	    from <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;)
	    using the supplied example, while the other runs
	    <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>rc.local</filename> (see &man.rc.8;) or from an
	    <filename>X</filename> script in
	    <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename>.  Both are
	    equally valid, and one may work in situations where the
	    other does not.  In both cases the result is the same: X
	    will pop up a graphical login prompt.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ttys.5; method has the advantage of
	    documenting which vty X will start on and passing the
	    responsibility of restarting the X server on logout to
	    &man.init.8;.  The &man.rc.8; method makes it easy to
	    <command>kill</command> <command>xdm</command> if there is
	    a problem starting the X server.</para>

	  <para>If loaded from &man.rc.8;, <command>xdm</command>
	    should be started without any arguments.
	    <command>xdm</command> must start
	    <emphasis>after</emphasis> &man.getty.8; runs, or else
	    <command>getty</command> and <command>xdm</command> will
	    conflict, locking out the console.  The best way around
	    this is to have the script sleep 10 seconds or so then
	    launch <command>xdm</command>.</para>

	  <para>When starting <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>, there still is a chance of
	    conflict between <command>xdm</command> and &man.getty.8;.
	    One way to avoid this is to add the <literal>vt</literal>
	    number in
	    <filename>/usr/local/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>:0 local /usr/local/bin/X vt4</programlisting>

	  <para>The above example will direct the X server to run in
	    <filename>/dev/ttyv3</filename>.  Note the number is
	    offset by one.  The X server counts the vty from one,
	    whereas the &os; kernel numbers the vty from zero.</para>

	  <programlisting>xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmaprc</programlisting>

	  <para>For example, to map the 3 keys to be

	  <para>Why is my <command>ipfw</command> <quote>fwd</quote>
	    rule to redirect a service to another machine not
	    working?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Possibly because network address translation (NAT) is
	    needed instead of just forwarding packets.  A
	    <quote>fwd</quote> rule only forwards packets, it does not
	    actually change the data inside the packet.  Consider this
	    rule:</para>

	  <screen>01000 fwd <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable> from any to <replaceable>foo 21</replaceable></screen>

	  <para>When a packet with a destination address of
	    <replaceable>foo</replaceable> arrives at the machine with
	    this rule, the packet is forwarded to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>, but it still has the
	    destination address of <replaceable>foo</replaceable>.
	    The destination address of the packet is
	    not changed to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>.  Most machines would
	    probably drop a packet that they receive with a
	    destination address that is not their own.  Therefore,
	    using a <quote>fwd</quote> rule does not often work the

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This kernel message indicates that some activity is
	    provoking it to send a large amount of ICMP or TCP reset
	    (RST) responses.  ICMP responses are
	    often generated as a result of attempted connections to
	    unused UDP ports.  TCP resets are generated as a result of
	    attempted connections to unopened TCP ports.  Among
	    others, these are the kinds of activities which may cause
	    these messages:</para>

		number of ports (as opposed to only trying a few
		well-known ports).</para>

	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>The first number in the message indicates how many
	    packets the kernel would have sent if the limit was not in
	    place, and the second indicates the limit.  This limit
	    is controlled using
	    <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname>.  This example
	    sets the limit to <literal>300</literal>
	    packets per second:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.icmp.icmplim=300</userinput></screen>

	  <para>To disable these messages

	    to disable the output:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output=0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Finally, to disable response limiting completely,
	    set <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname> to

	  <para><quote>Sandbox</quote> is a security term.  It can

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>A process which is placed inside a set of virtual
		walls that are designed to prevent someone who breaks
		into the process from being able to break into the

	      <para>The process is only able to run inside the walls.
		Since nothing the process does in regards to executing
		code is supposed to be able to breach the walls, a
		detailed audit of its code is not needed in order to
		be able to say certain things about its
		security.</para>

	      <para>The walls might be a user ID, for example.
		This is the definition used in the &man.security.7;
		and &man.named.8; man pages.</para>

	      <para>Take the <literal>ntalk</literal> service, for
		example (see &man.inetd.8;).  This service used to run
		as user&nbsp;ID <systemitem
		  class="username">root</systemitem>.  Now it runs as
		user&nbsp;ID <systemitem
		  class="username">tty</systemitem>.  The <systemitem

		any real data.</para>

	      <para>The most common way to accomplish this is to build

	      <para>Another common use is to mount an underlying file

		on top of it that gives a process a seemingly
		writeable view into that file system.  The process may
		believe it is able to write to those files, but only
		the process sees the effects &mdash; other processes
		in the system do not, necessarily.</para>

	<question xml:id="securelevel">
	  <para>What is securelevel?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><literal>securelevel</literal> is a security
	    mechanism implemented in the kernel.  When the securelevel
	    is positive, the kernel restricts certain tasks; not even
	    the superuser (<systemitem
	      class="username">root</systemitem>) is allowed to do
	    them.  The securelevel mechanism limits the ability
	    to:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Unset certain file flags, such as
		<literal>schg</literal> (the system immutable
		flag).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Write to kernel memory via
		<filename>/dev/mem</filename> and
		<filename>/dev/kmem</filename>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Load kernel modules.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Alter firewall rules.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>To check the status of the securelevel on a running
	    system:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -n kern.securelevel</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The output contains the current value of the
	    securelevel.  If it is greater than 0, at
	    least some of the securelevel's protections are
	    enabled.</para>

	  <para>The securelevel of a running system cannot be lowered
	    as this would defeat its purpose.  If a task requires that
	    the securelevel be non-positive, change the
	    <varname>kern_securelevel</varname> and
	    <varname>kern_securelevel_enable</varname> variables in
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and reboot.</para>

	  <para>For more information on securelevel and the specific
	    things all the levels do, consult &man.init.8;.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Securelevel is not a silver bullet; it has many
	      known deficiencies.  More often than not, it provides a
	      false sense of security.</para>

	    <para>One of its biggest problems is that in order for it
	      to be at all effective, all files used in the boot
	      process up until the securelevel is set must be
	      protected.  If an attacker can get the system to execute
	      their code prior to the securelevel being set (which
	      happens quite late in the boot process since some things
	      the system must do at start-up cannot be done at an
	      elevated securelevel), its protections are invalidated.
	      While this task of protecting all files used in the boot
	      process is not technically impossible, if it is
	      achieved, system maintenance will become a nightmare
	      since one would have to take the system down, at least
	      to single-user mode, to modify a configuration
	      file.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>BIND uses a random high-numbered port for outgoing

	  <para>Many people experience hung connections with no

	    which side of the link is hung.</para>

	  <para>When using an external modem, try
	    using &man.ping.8; to see if the <acronym>TD</acronym>
	    light is flashing when data is transmitted.  If it flashes
	    but the <acronym>RD</acronym> light does not, the
	    problem is with the remote end.  If <acronym>TD</acronym>
	    does not flash, the problem is local.  With an internal
	    modem, use the <literal>set
	      server</literal> command in
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename>.  When the hang occurs,
	    connect to &man.ppp.8; using &man.pppctl.8;.  If the
	    network connection suddenly revives due to the activity on
	    the diagnostic socket, or if it will not
	    connect but the <literal>set socket</literal>
	    command succeeded at startup time, the problem is local.
	    If it can connect but things are still hung, enable local
	    logging with <literal>set log local async</literal>
	    and use &man.ping.8; from another window or terminal to
	    make use of the link.  The async logging will show the
	    data being transmitted and received on the link.  If data
	    is going out and not coming back, the problem is
	    remote.</para>

	  <para>Having established whether the problem is local or
	    remote, there are now two possibilities:</para>

	  <para>There is very little that can be done about this.
	    Many ISPs will refuse to help users not running a
	    &microsoft; OS.  Add <literal>enable lqr</literal> to
	    <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>, allowing

	    This detection is relatively slow and therefore not that
	    useful.</para>

	  <para>First, try disabling all local compression by adding
	    the following to the configuration:</para>

	  <programlisting>disable pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
deny pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj</programlisting>

	  <para>Then reconnect to ensure that this makes no
	    difference.  If things improve or if the problem is solved
	    completely, determine which setting makes the difference
	    through trial and error.  This is good information for
	    the ISP, although it may make
	    it apparent that it is not a &microsoft; system.</para>

	  <para>Before contacting the ISP, enable async logging
	    locally and wait until the connection hangs again.  This
	    may use up quite a bit of disk space.  The last data read
	    from the port may be of interest.  It is usually ASCII
	    data, and may even describe the problem (<errorname>Memory
	      fault</errorname>, <errorname>Core
	      dumped</errorname>).</para>

	  <para>If the ISP is helpful, they should be able to enable

	<question xml:id="ppp-same-magic">
	  <para>I keep seeing errors about magic being the same.  What
	    does it mean?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Occasionally, just after connecting, there may be
	    messages in the log that say <errorname>Magic is
	      same</errorname>.  Sometimes, these messages are
	    harmless, and sometimes one side or the other exits.  Most
	    PPP implementations cannot survive this problem, and even
	    if the link seems to come up, there will be repeated
	    configure requests and configure acknowledgments in the
	    log file until &man.ppp.8; eventually gives up and closes
	    the connection.</para>

	  <para>This normally happens on server machines with slow
	    disks that are spawning a &man.getty.8; on the port, and
	    executing &man.ppp.8; from a login script or program after
	    login.  There were reports of it happening consistently
	    when using slirp.  The reason is that in the time taken
	    between &man.getty.8; exiting and &man.ppp.8; starting,
	    the client-side &man.ppp.8; starts sending Line Control
	    Protocol (LCP) packets.  Because ECHO is still switched on
	    for the port on the server, the client &man.ppp.8; sees
	    these packets <quote>reflect</quote> back.</para>

	  <para>One part of the LCP negotiation is to establish a
	    magic number for each side of the link so that
	    <quote>reflections</quote> can be detected.  The protocol
	    says that when the peer tries to negotiate the same magic
	    number, a NAK should be sent and a new magic number should
	    be chosen.  During the period that the server port has
	    ECHO turned on, the client &man.ppp.8; sends LCP packets,
	    sees the same magic in the reflected packet and NAKs it.
	    It also sees the NAK reflect (which also means &man.ppp.8;
	    must change its magic).  This produces a potentially
	    enormous number of magic number changes, all of which are
	    happily piling into the server's tty buffer.  As soon as
	    &man.ppp.8; starts on the server, it is flooded with magic
	    number changes and almost immediately decides it has tried
	    enough to negotiate LCP and gives up.  Meanwhile, the
	    client, who no longer sees the reflections, becomes happy
	    just in time to see a hangup from the server.</para>

	  <para>This can be avoided by allowing the peer to start
	    negotiating with the following line in
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to wait for the server to
	    initiate LCP negotiations.  Some servers however may never
	    initiate negotiations.  In this case, try
	    something like:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode active 3</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to be passive for 3 seconds,
	    and then to start sending LCP requests.  If the peer
	    starts sending requests during this period, &man.ppp.8;

	<question xml:id="ppp-lcp-constant">
	  <para>LCP negotiations continue until the connection is
	    closed.  What is wrong?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There is currently an implementation mis-feature in
	    &man.ppp.8; where it does not associate LCP, CCP &amp;
	    IPCP responses with their original requests.  As a result,
	    if one PPP implementation is more than 6 seconds slower
	    than the other side, the other side will send two
	    additional LCP configuration requests.  This is
	    fatal.</para>

	  <para>Consider two implementations,
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> and <systemitem>B</systemitem>.
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> starts sending LCP requests
	    immediately after connecting and
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> takes 7 seconds to start.  When
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> starts,
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> has sent 3 LCP REQs.  We are
	    assuming the line has ECHO switched off, otherwise we
	    would see magic number problems as described in the
	    previous section.  <systemitem>B</systemitem> sends a REQ,
	    then an ACK to the first of <systemitem>A</systemitem>'s
	    REQs.  This results in <systemitem>A</systemitem> entering
	    the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state and sending and ACK
	    (the first) back to <systemitem>B</systemitem>.  In the
	    meantime, <systemitem>B</systemitem> sends back two more
	    ACKs in response to the two additional REQs sent by
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> before
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> started up.
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> then receives the first ACK
	    from <systemitem>A</systemitem> and enters the
	    <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> receives the second ACK from
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> and goes back to the
	    <acronym>REQ-SENT</acronym> state, sending another (forth)
	    REQ as per the RFC.  It then receives the third ACK and
	    enters the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.  In the
	    meantime, <systemitem>B</systemitem> receives the forth
	    REQ from <systemitem>A</systemitem>, resulting in it
	    reverting to the <acronym>ACK-SENT</acronym> state and
	    sending another (second) REQ and (forth) ACK as per the
	    RFC.  <systemitem>A</systemitem> gets the REQ, goes into
	    <acronym>REQ-SENT</acronym> and sends another REQ.  It
	    immediately receives the following ACK and enters
	    <acronym>OPENED</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>This goes on until one side figures out that they are
	    getting nowhere and gives up.</para>

	  <para>The best way to avoid this is to configure one side to
	    be <literal>passive</literal> &mdash; that is, make one
	    side wait for the other to start negotiating.  This can be
	    done with the following command:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

	  <para>Care should be taken with this option.  This command
	    can also be used to limit the amount of time that
	    &man.ppp.8; waits for the peer to begin
	    negotiations:</para>

	  <programlisting>set stopped <replaceable>N</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>Alternatively, the following command (where
	    <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the number of seconds to
	    wait before starting negotiations) can be used:</para>

	  <para>Why does &man.ppp.8; dial for no reason in

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>If &man.ppp.8; is dialing unexpectedly,
	    determine the cause, and set up dial filters to
	    prevent such dialing.</para>

	  <para>To determine the cause, use the following line:</para>

	  <programlisting>set log +tcp/ip</programlisting>

	  <para>This will log all traffic through the connection.  The
	    next time the line comes up unexpectedly, the
	    reason will be logged with a convenient timestamp next to
	    it.</para>

	  <para>Next, disable dialing under these circumstances.
	    Usually, this sort of problem arises due to DNS lookups.
	    To prevent DNS lookups from establishing a connection
	    (this will <emphasis>not</emphasis> prevent &man.ppp.8;
	    from passing the packets through an established
	    connection), use the following:</para>

	  <programlisting>set dfilter 1 deny udp src eq 53
set dfilter 2 deny udp dst eq 53
set dfilter 3 permit 0/0 0/0</programlisting>

	  <para>This is not always suitable, as it will effectively
	    break demand-dial capabilities.  Most programs
	    will need a DNS lookup before doing any other network
	    related things.</para>

	  <para>In the DNS case, try to determine what is actually
	    trying to resolve a host name.  A lot of the time,
	    <application>Sendmail</application> is the culprit.  Make
	    sure to configure <application>Sendmail</application> not

	<question xml:id="fcs-errors">
	  <para>What are FCS errors?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>FCS stands for Frame Check Sequence.  Each PPP packet
	    has a checksum attached to ensure that the data being
	    received is the data being sent.  If the FCS of an
	    incoming packet is incorrect, the packet is dropped and
	    the HDLC FCS count is increased.  The HDLC error values
	    can be displayed using the <literal>show hdlc</literal>
	    command.</para>

	  <para>If the link is bad or if the serial driver is dropping
	    packets, it will produce the occasional FCS error.
	    This is not usually worth worrying about although it does
	    slow down the compression protocols substantially.</para>

	  <para>If the link freezes as soon as it connects and
	    produces a large number of FCS errors, make sure the modem
	    is not using software flow control (XON/XOFF).  If the
	    link must use software flow control, use
	    <literal>set accmap 0x000a0000</literal> to
	    tell &man.ppp.8; to escape the <literal>^Q</literal> and
	    <literal>^S</literal> characters.</para>

	  <para>Another reason for too many FCS errors may be
	    that the remote end has stopped talking
	    <acronym>PPP</acronym>.  In this case, enable
	    <literal>async</literal> logging to
	    determine if the incoming data is actually a login or
	    shell prompt.  If it is a shell prompt at the remote
	    end, it is possible to terminate &man.ppp.8; without
	    dropping the line by using <command>close lcp</command>
	    followed by <command>term</command>) to reconnect to
	    the shell on the remote machine.</para>

	  <para>The simple answer is that free memory is wasted
	    memory.  Any memory that programs do not actively
	    allocate is used within the &os; kernel as disk cache.
	    The values shown by &man.top.1; labeled as
	    <literal>Inact</literal> and <literal>Laundry</literal>
	    are cached data at different
	    aging levels.  This cached data means the system does not
	    have to access a slow disk again for data it has accessed
	    recently, thus increasing overall performance.  In
	    general, a low value shown for <literal>Free</literal>
	    memory in &man.top.1; is good, provided it is not
	    <emphasis>very</emphasis> low.</para>

	<question xml:id="chmod-symlinks">
	  <para>Why will <command>chmod</command> not change the
	    permissions on symlinks?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Symlinks do not have permissions, and by default,
	    &man.chmod.1; will follow symlinks to change the
	    permissions on the source file, if possible.  For
	    the file, <filename>foo</filename> with a symlink named
	    <filename>bar</filename>, this command
	    will always succeed.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod g-w bar</userinput></screen>

	  <para>However, the permissions on <filename>bar</filename>
	    will not have changed.</para>

	  <para>When changing modes of the file hierarchies rooted in
	    the files instead of the files themselves, use
	    either <option>-H</option> or <option>-L</option> together
	    with <option>-R</option> to make this work.  See
	    &man.chmod.1; and &man.symlink.7; for more
	    information.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para><option>-R</option> does a
	      <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> &man.chmod.1;.  Be
	      careful about specifying directories or symlinks to
	      directories to &man.chmod.1;.  To change the
	      permissions of a directory referenced by a symlink, use
	      &man.chmod.1; without any options and follow the symlink
	      with a trailing slash (<filename>/</filename>).  For
	      example, if <filename>foo</filename> is a symlink to
	      directory <filename>bar</filename>, to
	      change the permissions of <filename>foo</filename>
	      (actually <filename>bar</filename>), do
	      something like:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod 555 foo/</userinput></screen>

	    <para>With the trailing slash, &man.chmod.1; will follow
	      the symlink, <filename>foo</filename>, to change the
	      permissions of the directory,
	      <filename>bar</filename>.</para>

	<question xml:id="bikeshed-painting">
	  <para>Why should I care what color the bikeshed is?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The really, really short answer is that you should
	    not.  The somewhat longer answer is that just because you
	    are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you
	    should stop others from building one just because you do
	    not like the color they plan to paint it.  This is a
	    metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every
	    little feature just because you know enough to do so.
	    Some people have commented that the amount of noise
	    generated by a change is inversely proportional to the
	    complexity of the change.</para>

	  <para>The longer and more complete answer is that after a
	    very long argument about whether &man.sleep.1; should take
	    fractional second arguments, &a.phk.email; posted a long
	    message entitled <quote><link
	      xlink:href="http://www.bikeshed.com">A
	      bike shed (any color will do) on greener
	      grass...</link></quote>.  The appropriate portions of
	    that message are quoted below.</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <attribution>&a.phk.email; on &a.hackers.name;, October 2,
	      1999</attribution>

	    <para><quote>What is it about this bike shed?</quote>
	      Some of you have asked me.</para>

	    <para>It is a long story, or rather it is an old story,
	      but it is quite short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson
	      wrote a book in the early 1960s, called
	      <quote>Parkinson's Law</quote>, which contains a lot of
	      insight into the dynamics of management.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>[snip a bit of commentary on the
		book]</emphasis></para>

	    <para>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the
	      other vital component is an atomic power-plant, I guess
	      that illustrates the age of the book.</para>

	    <para>Parkinson shows how you can go into the board of
	      directors and get approval for building a multi-million
	      or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you
	      want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in
	      endless discussions.</para>

	    <para>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic
	      plant is so vast, so expensive and so complicated that
	      people cannot grasp it, and rather than try, they fall
	      back on the assumption that somebody else checked all
	      the details before it got this far.  Richard P. Feynmann
	      gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the
	      point, examples relating to Los Alamos in his
	      books.</para>

	    <para>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one
	      of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch
	      the game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no
	      matter how reasonable you are with your proposal,
	      somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing
	      his job, that he is paying attention, that he is
	      <emphasis>here</emphasis>.</para>

	    <para>In Denmark we call it <quote>setting your
		fingerprint</quote>.  It is about personal pride and
	      prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere and
	      say <quote>There!  <emphasis>I</emphasis> did
		that.</quote> It is a strong trait in politicians, but
	      present in most people given the chance.  Just think

	    have never seen a mention of &os;.  It seems to run really
	    hot.</para>

	  <para>A.  No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
	    blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
	    LSD-25 administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers
	    said that &os; tasted sort of orange, whereas &linux;
	    tasted like purple haze.  Neither group mentioned any
	    significant variances in temperature.  We eventually had
	    to throw the results of this survey out entirely anyway
	    when we found that too many volunteers were wandering out
	    of the room during the tests, thus skewing the results.

	<answer>
	  <para>Q.  Is there anything <quote>odd</quote> that &os;
	    does when compiling the kernel which would cause the
	    memory to make a scratchy sound?  When compiling (and for
	    a brief moment after recognizing the floppy drive upon
	    startup, as well), a strange scratchy sound emanates from
	    what appears to be the memory banks.</para>

	  <para>A.  Yes!  You will see frequent references to
	    <quote>daemons</quote> in the BSD documentation, and what
	    most people do not know is that this refers to genuine,
	    non-corporeal entities that now possess your computer.
	    The scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
	    high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as
	    they best decide how to deal with various system
	    administration tasks.</para>

	  <para>If the noise gets to you, a good <command>fdisk
	      /mbr</command> from DOS will get rid of them, but do not
	    be surprised if they react adversely and try to stop you.
	    In fact, if at any point during the exercise you hear the

	    speaker, take off running and do not ever look back!
	    Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD
	    daemons, the twin demons of DOS and &windows; are often
	    able to re-assert total control over your machine to the

	<question xml:id="dev-null">
	  <para>Where does data written to
	    <filename>/dev/null</filename> go?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>It goes into a special data sink in the CPU where it
	    is converted to heat which is vented through the heatsink
	    / fan assembly.  This is why CPU cooling is increasingly
	    important; as people get used to faster processors, they
	    become careless with their data and more and more of it
	    ends up in <filename>/dev/null</filename>, overheating
	    their CPUs.  If you delete <filename>/dev/null</filename>
	    (which effectively disables the CPU data sink) your CPU
	    may run cooler but your system will quickly become
	    constipated with all that excess data and start to behave
	    erratically.  If you have a fast network connection you
	    can cool down your CPU by reading data out of
	    <filename>/dev/random</filename> and sending it off
	    somewhere; however you run the risk of overheating your
	    network connection and <filename>/</filename> or angering
	    your ISP, as most of the data will end up getting
	    converted to heat by their equipment, but they generally
	    have good cooling, so if you do not overdo it you should
	    be OK.</para>

	  <para><emphasis>Paul Robinson adds:</emphasis></para>

	  <para>There are other methods.  As every good sysadmin
	    knows, it is part of standard practice to send data to the
	    screen of interesting variety to keep all the pixies that
	    make up your picture happy.  Screen pixies (commonly
	    mis-typed or re-named as <quote>pixels</quote>) are
	    categorized by the type of hat they wear (red, green or
	    blue) and will hide or appear (thereby showing the color
	    of their hat) whenever they receive a little piece of
	    food.  Video cards turn data into pixie-food, and then
	    send them to the pixies &mdash; the more expensive the
	    card, the better the food, so the better behaved the
	    pixies are.  They also need constant stimulation &mdash;
	    this is why screen savers exist.</para>

	  <para>To take your suggestions further, you could just throw
	    the random data to console, thereby letting the pixies
	    consume it.  This causes no heat to be produced at all,
	    keeps the pixies happy and gets rid of your data quite
	    quickly, even if it does make things look a bit messy on
	    your screen.</para>

	  <para>Incidentally, as an ex-admin of a large ISP who
	    experienced many problems attempting to maintain a stable

	<question xml:id="kernel-panic-troubleshooting">
	  <para>How can I make the most of the data I see when my
	    kernel panics?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Here is typical kernel panic:</para>

	  <programlisting>Fatal trap 12: page fault while in kernel mode
fault virtual address   = 0x40
fault code              = supervisor read, page not present
instruction pointer     = 0x8:0xf014a7e5
stack pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f24
frame pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f28
code segment            = base 0x0, limit 0xfffff, type 0x1b
                        = DPL 0, pres 1, def32 1, gran 1
processor eflags        = interrupt enabled, resume, IOPL = 0
current process         = 80 (mount)
interrupt mask          =
trap number             = 12
panic: page fault</programlisting>

	  <para>This message is not enough.  While the instruction
	    pointer value is important, it is also configuration
	    dependent as it varies depending on the kernel image.
	    If it is a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel
	    image from one of the snapshots, it is possible for
	    somebody else to track down the offending function, but
	    for a custom kernel, only you can tell us where the fault
	    occurred.</para>

	  <para>To proceed:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Write down the instruction pointer value.  Note
		that the <literal>0x8:</literal> part at the beginning
		is not significant in this case: it is the
		<literal>0xf0xxxxxx</literal> part that we
		want.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>When the system reboots, do the following:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm -n kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>where <literal>f0xxxxxx</literal> is the
		instruction pointer value.  The odds are you will not
		get an exact match since the symbols in the kernel
		symbol table are for the entry points of functions and
		the instruction pointer address will be somewhere
		inside a function, not at the start.  If you do not
		get an exact match, omit the last digit from the
		instruction pointer value and try again:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm -n kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>If that does not yield any results, chop off
		another digit.  Repeat until there is some sort of
		output.  The result will be a possible list of
		functions which caused the panic.  This is a less than
		exact mechanism for tracking down the point of
		failure, but it is better than nothing.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>However, the best way to track down the cause of a
	    panic is by capturing a crash dump, then using
	    &man.kgdb.1; to generate a stack trace on the crash
	    dump.</para>

	  <para>In any case, the method is this:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Make sure that the following line is included in
		the kernel configuration file:</para>

	      <programlisting>makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Change to the <filename>/usr/src</filename>
		directory:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Compile the kernel:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildkernel KERNCONF=<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Wait for &man.make.1; to finish compiling.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Reboot.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <note>
	    <para>If <varname>KERNCONF</varname> is not included,
	      the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel will instead
	      be built and installed.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The &man.make.1; process will have built two kernels.
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel</filename>
	    and
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel.debug</filename>.
	    <filename>kernel</filename> was installed as
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename>, while
	    <filename>kernel.debug</filename> can be used as the
	    source of debugging symbols for &man.kgdb.1;.</para>

	  <para>To capture a crash dump, edit
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and set
	    <literal>dumpdev</literal> to point to either the swap
	    partition or <literal>AUTO</literal>.  This will cause the
	    &man.rc.8; scripts to use the &man.dumpon.8; command to
	    enable crash dumps.  This command can also be run
	    manually.  After a panic, the crash dump can be recovered
	    using &man.savecore.8;; if <literal>dumpdev</literal> is
	    set in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the &man.rc.8;
	    scripts will run &man.savecore.8; automatically and put
	    the crash dump in <filename>/var/crash</filename>.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>&os; crash dumps are usually the same size as
	      physical RAM.  Therefore, make sure there is enough
	      space in <filename>/var/crash</filename> to hold the
	      dump.  Alternatively, run &man.savecore.8; manually
	      and have it recover the crash dump to another directory
	      with more room.  It is possible to limit the
	      size of the crash dump by using <literal>options
		MAXMEM=N</literal> where
	      <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the size of kernel's
	      memory usage in KBs.  For example, for 1&nbsp;GB
	      of RAM, limit the kernel's memory usage to
	      128&nbsp;MB, so that the crash dump size
	      will be 128&nbsp;MB instead of 1&nbsp;GB.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>Once the crash dump has been recovered , get a
	    stack trace as follows:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>kgdb /usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel.debug /var/crash/vmcore.0</userinput>
<prompt>(kgdb)</prompt> <userinput>backtrace</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Note that there may be several screens worth of
	    information.  Ideally, use &man.script.1; to
	    capture all of them.  Using the unstripped kernel image
	    with all the debug symbols should show the exact line of
	    kernel source code where the panic occurred.  The stack
	    trace is usually read from the bottom up to trace
	    the exact sequence of events that lead to the crash.
	    &man.kgdb.1; can also be used to print out the contents of
	    various variables or structures to examine the system
	    state at the time of the crash.</para>

	  <tip>
	    <para>If a second computer is available, &man.kgdb.1; can
	      be configured to do remote debugging, including setting
	      breakpoints and single-stepping through the kernel
	      code.</para>
	  </tip>

	  <note>
	    <para>If <literal>DDB</literal> is enabled and the
	      kernel drops into the debugger, a panic
	      and a crash dump can be forced by typing
	      <literal>panic</literal> at the <literal>ddb</literal>
	      prompt.  It may stop in the debugger again during the
	      panic phase.  If it does, type
	      <literal>continue</literal> and it will finish the crash
	      dump.</para>

	<question xml:id="dlsym-failure">
	  <para>Why has <function>dlsym()</function> stopped working
	    for ELF executables?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The ELF toolchain does not, by default, make the
	    symbols defined in an executable visible to the dynamic
	    linker.  Consequently <function>dlsym()</function>
	    searches on handles obtained from calls to
	    <function>dlopen(NULL, flags)</function> will fail to find
	    such symbols.</para>

	  <para>To search, using
	    <function>dlsym()</function>, for symbols present in the
	    main executable of a process, link the
	    executable using the <option>--export-dynamic</option>

	<answer>
	  <para>By default, the kernel address space is 1&nbsp;GB
	    (2&nbsp;GB for PAE) for i386.  When running a
	    network-intensive server or using
	    ZFS, this will probably not be
	    enough.</para>

	  <para>Add the following line to the kernel configuration
	    file to increase available space and rebuild the
	    kernel:</para>

	  <programlisting>options KVA_PAGES=<replaceable>N</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>To find the correct value of
	    <replaceable>N</replaceable>, divide the desired address
	    space size (in megabytes) by four.  (For example, it is
	    <literal>512</literal> for 2&nbsp;GB.)</para>

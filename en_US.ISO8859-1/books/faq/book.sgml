      system (and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended

	<question id="what-is-FreeBSD">
	  <para>What is &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Briefly, &os; is a &unix;&nbsp;like operating system for
	    AMD64 and &intel; EM64T, &i386; PC-98, IA-64, &arm;,
	    &powerpc; and &ultrasparc; platforms based on U.C.
	    Berkeley's <quote>4.4BSD-Lite</quote> release, with some
	    <quote>4.4BSD-Lite2</quote> enhancements.  It is also based
	    indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
	    <quote>Net/2</quote> to the &i386;, known as
	    <quote>386BSD</quote>, though very little of the 386BSD code
	    remains.  A fuller description of what &os; is and how it
	    can work for you may be found on the <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/index.html">&os; home page</ulink>.
	    </para>

	  <para>&os; is used by companies, Internet Service Providers,
	    researchers, computer professionals, students and home users
	    all over the world in their work, education and
	    recreation.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="FreeBSD-goals">
	  <para>What is the goal of the &os; Project?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The goal of the &os; Project is to provide software that
	    may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.
	    Many of us have a significant investment in the code (and
	    project) and would certainly not mind a little financial
	    compensation now and then, but we definitely do not insist
	    on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
	    <quote>mission</quote> is to provide code to any and all
	    comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the
	    widest possible use and provides the widest possible
	    benefit.  This is, we believe, one of the most fundamental
	    goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
	    support.</para>

	  <para>That code in our source tree which falls under the
	    <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</ulink>
	    or <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING.LIB">GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)</ulink>
	    comes with slightly more strings attached, though at least
	    on the side of enforced access rather than the usual
	    opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that can
	    evolve in the commercial use of GPL software, we do,
	    however, endeavor to replace such software with submissions
	    under the more relaxed <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">&os; license</ulink>
	    whenever possible.</para>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="bsd-license-restrictions">
	  <para>Does the &os; license have any restrictions?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Yes.  Those restrictions do not control how you use the
	    code, merely how you treat the &os; Project itself.  If you
	    have serious license concerns, read the actual <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">license</ulink>.
	    For the simply curious, the license can be summarized like
	    this.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="replace-current-OS">
	  <para>Can &os; replace my current operating system?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>For most people, yes.  But this question is not quite
	    that cut-and-dried.</para>

	  <para>Most people do not actually use an operating system.
	    They use applications.  The applications are what really use
	    the operating system.  &os; is designed to provide a robust
	    and full-featured environment for applications.  It supports
	    a wide variety of web browsers, office suites, email
	    readers, graphics programs, programming environments,
	    network servers, and just about everything else you might
	    want.  Most of these applications can be managed through the
	    <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/">Ports Collection</ulink>.
	    </para>

	  <para>If you need to use an application that is only available
	    on one operating system, you simply cannot replace that
	    operating system.  Chances are there is a very similar
	    application on &os;, however.  If you want a solid office or
	    Internet server, a reliable workstation, or just the ability
	    to do your job without interruptions, &os; will almost
	    certainly do everything you need.  Many computer users
	    across the world, including both novices and experienced
	    &unix; administrators, use &os; as their only desktop
	    operating system.</para>

	  <para>If you are migrating to &os; from some other &unix;
	    environment, you already know most of what you need to.  If
	    your background is in graphic-driven operating systems such
	    as &windows; and older versions of &macos;, expect to invest
	    additional time learning the &unix; way of doing things.
	    This FAQ and the <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">&os; Handbook</ulink>
	    are excellent places to start.</para>

	<question id="latest-version">
	  <para>What is the latest version of &os;?</para>
	</question>

<!--
  This answer is a hack to deal with the fact that for now there are
  multiple "latest" versions of FreeBSD.
-->

	<answer>
	  <para>At any point in the development of &os;, there can be
	    multiple parallel branches.  &rel.relx; releases are
	    made from the &rel.stable; branch, and &rel2.relx;
	    releases are made from the &rel2.stable; branch.</para>

	  <para>Up until the release of 8.0, the
	    &rel3.relx; series was the one known as
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>.  However, as of 8.0, the
	    &rel3.relx; branch will be designated for
	    an <quote>extended support</quote> status and receive only
	    fixes for major problems, such as security-related fixes.
	    There will be no more releases made from the
	    &rel3.stable; branch, and it is considered a
	    <quote>legacy</quote> branch and most current work will only
	    become a part of &rel.stable; and &rel2.stable;.</para>

	  <para>Version <ulink
	      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">&rel.current;</ulink>
	    is the latest release from the &rel.stable;
	    branch; it was released in &rel.current.date;.  Version
	    <ulink
	      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel2.current;-RELEASE/">&rel2.current;</ulink>
	    is the latest release from the &rel2.stable;
	    branch; it was released in &rel2.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>Briefly, <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> is aimed at the
	    ISP, corporate user, or any user who wants stability and a
	    minimal number of changes compared to the new (and possibly
	    unstable) features of the latest
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot.  Releases can come
	    from either branch, but <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> should
	    only be used if you are prepared for its increased
	    volatility (relative to <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>, that
	    is).</para>

	  <para>Releases are made <link
	      linkend="release-freq">every few months</link>.  While
	    many people stay more up-to-date with the &os; sources (see
	    the questions on <link
	      linkend="current">&os.current;</link> and <link
	      linkend="stable">&os.stable;</link>) than that, doing so
	    is more of a commitment, as the sources are a moving
	    target.</para>

	  <para>More information on &os; releases can be found on the
	    <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html">Release Engineering page</ulink>
	    on the &os; Web site.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="current">
	  <para>What is <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#CURRENT">&os.current;</ulink>
	    is the development version of the operating system, which
	    will in due course become the new &os.stable; branch.  As
	    such, it is really only of interest to developers working on
	    the system and die-hard hobbyists.  See the <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#CURRENT">relevant section</ulink>
	    in the <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">Handbook</ulink> for
	    details on running <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>If you are not familiar with the operating system or are
	    not capable of identifying the difference between a real
	    problem and a temporary problem, you should not use
	    &os.current;.  This branch sometimes evolves quite quickly
	    and can be un-buildable sometimes.
	    People that use &os.current; are expected to be able to
	    analyze any problems and only report them if they are deemed
	    to be mistakes rather than <quote>glitches</quote>.
	    Questions such as <quote>make world produces some error
	    about groups</quote> on the &a.current; may be treated with
	    contempt.</para>

	  <para>Every month, <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</ulink>
	    releases are made based on the current state of the
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> and
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branches.  The goals behind
	    each snapshot release are:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>To test the latest version of the installation
		software.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To give people who would like to run
		<emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> or
		<emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> but who do not have the
		time or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day basis an
		easy way of bootstrapping it onto their systems.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code in
		question, just in case we break something really badly
		later.  (Although CVS normally prevents anything
		horrible like this happening.)</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To ensure that all new features and fixes in need of
		testing have the greatest possible number of potential
		testers.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>No claims are made that any
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot can be considered
	    <quote>production quality</quote> for any purpose.  If you
	    want to run a stable and fully tested system, you will have
	    to stick to full releases, or use the
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> snapshots.</para>

	  <para>Snapshot releases are directly available from <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</ulink>.
	    </para>

	  <para>Official snapshots are generated each month on a regular
	    basis for all actively developed branches.  There are also
	    daily snapshot builds of the popular &arch.i386; and
	    &arch.amd64; branches, hosted on <ulink

	<question id="stable">
	  <para>What is the <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis>
	    concept?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Back when &os;&nbsp;2.0.5 was released, &os; development
	    branched in two.  One branch was named <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#STABLE">-STABLE</ulink>,
	    one <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#CURRENT">-CURRENT</ulink>.
	    <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis> is intended for Internet
	    Service Providers and other commercial enterprises for whom
	    sudden shifts or experimental features are quite
	    undesirable.  It receives only well-tested bug fixes and
	    other small incremental enhancements.
	    <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>, on the other hand, has
	    been one unbroken line since 2.0 was released, leading
	    towards &rel.current;-RELEASE and beyond.  For more detailed
	    information on branches see <quote><ulink
	      url="&url.articles.releng;/release-proc.html#REL-BRANCH">&os; Release Engineering: Creating the Release Branch</ulink></quote>,
	    the status of the branches and the upcoming release schedule
	    can be found on the <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng">Release Engineering Information</ulink> page.
	    </para>

	  <para>The 2.2-STABLE branch was retired with the release of
	    2.2.8.  The 3-STABLE branch has ended with the release of
	    3.5.1, the final 3.<replaceable>X</replaceable> release.
	    The 4-STABLE branch has ended with the release of 4.11, the
	    final 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable> release.  The only
	    changes made to either of these branches will be, for the
	    most part, security-related bug fixes.  Support for the
	    5-STABLE branches has ended with the release of 5.5, the
	    final 5.<replaceable>X</replaceable> release.  Support for
	    the 6-STABLE branch will continue for some time but focus
	    primarily on security-related bug fixes and other serious
	    issues.</para>

	  <para>&rel.current;-STABLE is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branch.  The latest release on
	    the &rel.current;-STABLE branch is &rel.current;-RELEASE,
	    which was released in &rel.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>The &rel.head; branch is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> branch toward the next
	    generation of &os;.  See <link

	<question id="release-freq">
	  <para>When are &os; releases made?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &a.re; releases a new major version of &os; about
	    every 18 months and a new minor version about every 8 months,
	    on average.  Release dates are announced well in advance, so
	    that the people working on the system know when their
	    projects need to be finished and tested.  A testing period
	    precedes each release, in order to ensure that the addition
	    of new features does not compromise the stability of the
	    release.  Many users regard this caution as one of the best
	    things about &os;, even though waiting for all the latest
	    goodies to reach <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> can be a
	    little frustrating.</para>

	  <para>More information on the release engineering process
	    (including a schedule of upcoming releases) can be found on
	    the <ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html">release engineering</ulink>

	    from &a.nectar; to the &a.mobile; describes a procedure
	    which may work if your newer IBM laptop does not boot &os;
	    properly, and you can upgrade or downgrade the BIOS.</para>

	  <para>If you have an earlier BIOS, and upgrading is not an

	  <para>First, you will need to restore the machine to a state
	    where it can get through its self-test screen.  Doing this
	    requires powering up the machine without letting it find a

	    the hard disk and temporarily move it to an older ThinkPad
	    (such as a ThinkPad 600) or a desktop PC with an appropriate
	    conversion cable.  Once it is there, you can delete the &os;
	    partition and move the hard disk back.  The ThinkPad should
	    now be in a bootable state again.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>If you are seeing things like the machine grinding to a

	    yourself:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Did you use a new, freshly-formatted, error-free
		floppy (preferably a brand-new one straight out of the
		box, as opposed to the magazine cover disk that has been
		lying under the bed for the last three years)?</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Did you download the floppy image in binary (or
		image) mode?  (do not be embarrassed, even the best of us
		have accidentally downloaded a binary file in ASCII mode
		at least once!)</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you are using &windows;&nbsp;95 or
		&windows;&nbsp;98 did you run <command>fdimage</command>
		or <command>rawrite</command> in pure DOS mode?  These
		operating systems can interfere with programs that write
		directly to hardware, which the disk creation program
		does; even running it inside a DOS shell in the GUI can
		cause this problem.</para>
	    </listitem>

	<question id="no-install-cdrom">
	  <para>I booted from my ATAPI CD-ROM, but the install program
	    says no CD-ROM is found.  Where did it go?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The usual cause of this problem is a mis-configured
	    CD-ROM drive.  Many PCs now ship with the CD-ROM as the slave
	    device on the secondary IDE controller, with no master
	    device on that controller.  This is illegal according to the
	    ATAPI specification, but &windows; plays fast and loose with
	    the specification, and the BIOS ignores it when booting.
	    This is why the BIOS was able to see the CD-ROM to boot from
	    it, but why &os; cannot see it to complete the
	    install.</para>

	  <para>Reconfigure your system so that the CD-ROM is either the
	    master device on the IDE controller it is attached to, or
	    make sure that it is the slave on an IDE controller that
	    also has a master device.</para>

	<question id="geometry">
	  <para>Which geometry should I use for a disk drive?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	    <note>
	      <para>By the <quote>geometry</quote> of a disk, we mean
		the number of cylinders, heads and sectors/track on a
		disk.  We will refer to this as C/H/S for convenience.
		This is how the PC's BIOS works out which area on a disk
		to read/write from.</para>
	    </note>

	  <para>This causes a lot of confusion among new system
	    administrators.  First of all, the
	    <emphasis>physical</emphasis> geometry of a SCSI drive is
	    totally irrelevant, as &os; works in term of disk blocks.
	    In fact, there is no such thing as <quote>the</quote>
	    physical geometry, as the sector density varies across the
	    disk.  What manufacturers claim is the <quote>physical
	    geometry</quote> is usually the geometry that they have
	    determined wastes the least space.  For IDE disks, &os; does
	    work in terms of C/H/S, but all modern drives internally
	    convert this into block references.</para>

	  <para>All that matters is the <emphasis>logical</emphasis>
	    geometry.  This is the answer that the BIOS gets when it
	    asks the drive <quote>what is your geometry?</quote> It then
	    uses this geometry to access the disk.  As &os; uses the
	    BIOS when booting, it is very important to get this right.
	    In particular, if you have more than one operating system on
	    a disk, they must all agree on the geometry.  Otherwise you
	    will have serious problems booting!</para>

	  <para>For SCSI disks, the geometry to use depends on whether
	    extended translation support is turned on in your controller
	    (this is often referred to as <quote>support for DOS disks
	    &gt;1GB</quote> or something similar).  If it is turned off,
	    then use <replaceable>N</replaceable> cylinders, 64 heads
	    and 32 sectors/track, where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is
	    the capacity of the disk in MB.  For example, a 2&nbsp;GB disk
	    should pretend to have 2048 cylinders, 64 heads and 32
	    sectors/track.</para>

	  <para>If it <emphasis>is</emphasis> turned on (it is often
	    supplied this way to get around certain limitations in
	    &ms-dos;) and the disk capacity is more than 1&nbsp;GB, use
	    <replaceable>M</replaceable> cylinders, 63 sectors per track
	    (<emphasis>not</emphasis> 64), and 255 heads, where
	    <replaceable>M</replaceable> is the disk capacity in MB
	    divided by 7.844238 (!).  So our example 2&nbsp;GB drive
	    would have 261 cylinders, 63 sectors per track and 255
	    heads.</para>

	  <para>If you are not sure about this, or &os; fails to detect
	    the geometry correctly during installation, the simplest way
	    around this is usually to create a small DOS partition on
	    the disk.  The BIOS should then detect the correct geometry,
	    and you can always remove the DOS partition in the partition
	    editor if you do not want to keep it.  You might want to
	    leave it around for programming network cards and the like,
	    however.</para>

	  <para>Alternatively, there is a freely available utility
	    distributed with &os; called
	    <filename>pfdisk.exe</filename>.  You can find it in the
	    <filename class="directory">tools</filename> subdirectory on
	    the &os; CD-ROM or on the various &os; FTP sites.  This
	    program can be used to work out what geometry the other
	    operating systems on the disk are using.  You can then enter
	    this geometry in the partition editor.</para>

	<question id="disk-divide-restrictions">
	  <para>Are there any restrictions on how I divide the disk

	<answer>
	  <para>Yes.  You must make sure that your root partition is
	    below 1024 cylinders so the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.
	    (Note that this is a limitation in the PC's BIOS, not
	    &os;).</para>

	  <para>For a SCSI drive, this will normally imply that the root
	    partition will be in the first 1024&nbsp;MB (or in the first
	    4096&nbsp;MB if extended translation is turned on &mdash; see
	    previous question).  For IDE, the corresponding figure is

	    Manager</application> and makes allowances for it.  Other disk
	    managers are not supported.</para>

	  <para>If you just want to use the disk with &os; you do not
	    need a disk manager.  Just configure the disk for as much
	    space as the BIOS can deal with (usually
	    504&nbsp;megabytes), and &os; should figure out how much
	    space you really have.  If you are using an old disk with an
	    MFM controller, you may need to explicitly tell &os; how
	    many cylinders to use.</para>

	  <para>If you want to use the disk with &os; and another
	    operating system, you may be able to do without a disk
	    manager: just make sure the &os; boot partition and the
	    slice for the other operating system are in the first 1024
	    cylinders.  If you are reasonably careful, a

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>&os;&nbsp;7 and 8 use MD5 password hashing by
	    default.  Recent versions
	    of &os; use <emphasis>SHA512</emphasis> by default.
	    These are
	    believed to be more secure than the traditional &unix;
	    password format, which used a scheme based on the
	    <emphasis>DES</emphasis> algorithm.  DES passwords are still
	    available if you need to share your password file with
	    legacy operating systems which still use the less secure
	    password format.  &os; also allows you to use the Blowfish
	    password format, which is more secure.  Which password
	    format to use for new passwords is controlled by the
	    <literal>passwd_format</literal> login capability in

	    installation?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This error comes from confusion between the boot block's
	    and the kernel's understanding of the disk devices.  The
	    error usually manifests on two-disk IDE systems, with the
	    hard disks arranged as the master or single device on
	    separate IDE controllers, with &os; installed on the
	    secondary IDE controller.  The boot blocks think the system
	    is installed on <devicename>ad0</devicename> (the second
	    BIOS disk) while the kernel assigns the first disk on the
	    secondary controller device, <devicename>ad2</devicename>.
	    After the device probing, the kernel tries to mount what the
	    boot blocks think is the boot disk,
	    <devicename>ad0</devicename>, while it is really
	    <devicename>ad2</devicename>, and fails.</para>

		to interrupt</literal> prompt.  This will drop you into
		the boot loader.</para>

	      <para>Then type
		<userinput>set root_disk_unit="<replaceable>disk_number</replaceable>"</userinput>.
		<replaceable>disk_number</replaceable> will be
		<literal>0</literal> if &os; is installed on the master
		drive on the first IDE controller, <literal>1</literal>
		if it is installed on the slave on the first IDE

		<literal>3</literal> if it is installed on the slave of

	      <para>Then type <userinput>boot</userinput>, and your

	      More than 16&nbsp;GB?  More than 48&nbsp;GB?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Yes.  &os; as an operating system generally supports
	      as much physical memory (RAM) as the platform it is running
	      on does.  Keep in mind that different platforms have
	      different limits for memory; for example &i386; without
	      <acronym>PAE</acronym> supports at most 4&nbsp;GB of
	      memory (and usually less than that because of PCI address
	      space) and &i386; with PAE supports at most 64&nbsp;GB
	      memory.  AMD64 platforms currently deployed support up to
	      1&nbsp;TB of physical memory.</para>

	  <question id="memory-i386-over-4gb">
	    <para>Why does &os; report less than 4&nbsp;GB memory when
	      installed on an &i386; machine?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The total address space on &i386; machines is 32-bit,
	      meaning that at most 4&nbsp;GB of memory is addressable (can
	      be accessed).  Furthermore, some addresses in this range
	      are reserved by hardware for different purposes, for
	      example for using and controlling PCI devices, for
	      accessing video memory, and so on.  Therefore, the total
	      amount of memory usable by the operating system for its
	      kernel and applications is limited to significantly less
	      than 4&nbsp;GB.  Usually, 3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB is
	      the maximum usable physical memory in this
	      configuration.</para>

	    <para>To access more than 3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB of
	      installed memory (meaning up to 4&nbsp;GB but also more than
	      4&nbsp;GB), a special tweak called <acronym>PAE</acronym>
	      must be used.  PAE stands for Physical Address Extension
	      and is a way for 32-bit x86 CPUs to address more than
	      4&nbsp;GB of memory.  It remaps the memory that would
	      otherwise be overlaid by address reservations for
	      hardware devices above the 4&nbsp;GB range and uses it as
	      additional physical memory (see &man.pae.4;).  Using PAE
	      has some drawbacks; this mode of memory access is a little
	      bit slower than the normal (without PAE) mode and loadable
	      modules (see &man.kld.4;) are not supported.  This means
	      all drivers must be compiled into the kernel.</para>

	    <para>The most common way to enable PAE is to build a new
	      kernel with the special ready-provided kernel configuration
	      file called <filename>PAE</filename>, which is already
	      configured to build a safe kernel.  Note that some entries
	      in this kernel configuration file are too conservative and
	      some drivers marked as unready to be used with PAE are
	      actually usable.  A rule of thumb is that if the driver is
	      usable on 64-bit architectures (like AMD64), it is also
	      usable with PAE.  If you wish to create your own kernel
	      configuration file, you can enable PAE by adding the
	      following line to your configuration:</para>

	    <programlisting>options       PAE</programlisting>

	    <para>PAE is not much used nowadays because most new x86
	      hardware also supports running in 64-bit mode, known as
	      AMD64 or &intel;&nbsp;64.  It has a much larger address
	      space and does not need such tweaks.  &os; supports AMD64
	      and it is recommended that this version of &os; be used
	      instead of the &i386; version if 4&nbsp;GB or more memory
	      is required.</para>

	  <answer>
	    <para>If you are using the default console driver,
	      &man.syscons.4;, you can use a mouse pointer in text
	      consoles to cut &amp; paste text.  Run the mouse daemon,
	      &man.moused.8;, and turn on the mouse pointer in the
	      virtual console:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>moused -p /dev/<replaceable>xxxx</replaceable> -t <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>vidcontrol -m on</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Where <replaceable>xxxx</replaceable> is the mouse
	      device name and <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable> is a
	      protocol type for the mouse.  The mouse daemon can
	      automatically determine the protocol type of most mice,
	      except old serial mice.  Specify the
	      <literal>auto</literal> protocol to invoke automatic
	      detection.  If automatic detection does not work, see the
	      &man.moused.8; manual page for a list of supported
	      protocol types.</para>

	    <para>If you have a PS/2 mouse, just add
	      <literal>moused_enable="YES"</literal> to
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to start the mouse

	<question id="pae">
	  <para>Why is &os; finding the wrong amount of memory on &i386;
	    hardware?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The most likely reason is the difference between
	    physical memory addresses and virtual addresses.</para>

	  <para>The convention for most PC hardware is to use the memory
	    area between 3.5&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB for a special purpose
	    (usually for PCI).  This address space is used to access PCI
	    hardware.  As a result real, physical memory can not be
	    accessed by that address space.</para>

	  <para>What happens to the memory that should appear in that
	    location is dependent on your hardware.  Unfortunately, some
	    hardware does nothing and the ability to use that last
	    500&nbsp;MB of RAM is entirely lost.</para>

	  <para>Luckily, most hardware remaps the memory to a higher
	    location so that it can still be used.  However, this can
	    cause some confusion if you watch the boot messages.</para>

	  <para>On a 32-bit version of &os;, the memory appears
	    lost, since it will be remapped above 4&nbsp;GB, which a
	    32-bit kernel is unable to access.  In this case, the
	    solution is to build a PAE enabled kernel.  See <link
	      linkend="memory-limits">the entry on memory limits</link>
	    and <link linkend="memory-upper-limitation">about different
	    memory limits on different platforms</link> for more
	    information.</para>

	  <para>On a 64-bit version of &os;, or when running a
	    PAE-enabled kernel, &os; will correctly detect and remap the
	    memory so it is usable.  During boot, however, it may seem
	    as if &os; is detecting more memory than the system really
	    has, due to the described remapping.  This is normal and the
	    available memory will be corrected as the boot process
	    completes.<para>

	  <para>What do I do when I have bad blocks on my hard

	<answer>
	  <para>With SCSI drives, the drive should be capable of
	    re-mapping these automatically.  However, many drives ship
	    with this feature disabled.</para>

	  <para>To enable bad block remapping edit the first device page
	    mode, which can be done by giving the command (as
	    <username>root</username>)</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>camcontrol modepage sd0 -m 1 -e -P 3</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Modern IDE drives also have bad block remapping features
	    in the controller, and they ship with this feature turned
	    on.</para>

	  <para>If you see warnings about bad blocks (on either type of
	    drive), it is time to consider replacing the drive.  You
	    might be able to use the drive manufacturer's diagnostic
	    program to lock out those bad blocks, but at best this will

	<question id="hpnetserver-scsi-failure">
	  <para>Why does &os; not detect my HP Netserver's SCSI

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is basically a known problem.  The EISA on-board
	    SCSI controller in the HP Netserver machines occupies EISA
	    slot number 11, so all the <quote>true</quote> EISA slots
	    are in front of it.  Alas, the address space for EISA slots
	    &gt;= 10 collides with the address space assigned to PCI,
	    and &os;'s auto-configuration currently cannot handle this
	    situation very well.</para>

	  <para>So now, the best you can do is to pretend there is no
	    address range clash :), by bumping the kernel option
	    <literal>EISA_SLOTS</literal> to a value of 12.  Configure
	    and compile a kernel, as described in the <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/kernelconfig.html">Handbook entry on configuring the kernel</ulink>.
	    </para>

	  <para>Of course, this does present you with a chicken-and-egg
	    problem when installing on such a machine.  In order to work
	    around this problem, a special hack is available inside
	    <emphasis>UserConfig</emphasis>.  Do not use the
	    <quote>visual</quote> interface, but the plain command-line
	    interface there.  Simply type the following command at the
	    prompt and install your system as usual:</para>

	  <programlisting>eisa 12
quit</programlisting>

	  <para>While it is recommended you compile and install a custom
	    kernel anyway.</para>

	  <para>Hopefully, future versions will have a proper fix for
	    this problem.</para>

	  <para>For example, suppose you are running

	    again, and the compile fails in the same place then this is

	<answer>
	  <para>Due to the manner in which &os; gets the memory size

	    messages.  What is wrong?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Normally, &os; determines a number of kernel parameters,
	    such as as the maximum number of files that can be open
	    concurrently, from the amount of memory installed in the
	    system.  On systems with one gigabyte of RAM or more, this

	    various tables and other structures that fill up most of the

	    running, the kernel has no more space left for dynamic

	  <para>Why do I get the error <errorname>kernel: proc: table is

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; kernel will only allow a certain number of
	    processes to exist at one time.  The number is based on the
	    <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> &man.sysctl.8; variable.
	    <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> also affects various other
	    in-kernel limits, such as network buffers (see <link
	      linkend="panic-kmemmap-too-small">this</link> earlier
	    question).  If your machine is heavily loaded, you probably
	    want to increase <varname>kern.maxusers</varname>.  This
	    will increase these other system limits in addition to the
	    maximum number of processes.</para>

	  <para>To adjust your <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> value,
	    see the <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/configtuning-kernel-limits.html#KERN-MAXFILES">File/Process Limits</ulink>
	    section of the Handbook.  (While that section refers to open
	    files, the same limits apply to processes.)</para>

	  <para>If your machine is lightly loaded, and you are simply
	    running a very large number of processes, you can adjust
	    this with the <varname>kern.maxproc</varname> tunable.  If
	    this tunable needs adjustment it needs to be defined in
	    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The tunable will
	    not get adjusted until the system is rebooted.  For more
	    information about tuning tunables, you should see the
	    &man.loader.conf.5; and &man.sysctl.conf.5; manual pages.
	    If these processes are being run by a single user, you will
	    also need to adjust <varname>kern.maxprocperuid</varname> to
	    be one less than your new <varname>kern.maxproc</varname>
	    value.  (It must be at least one less because one system
	    program, &man.init.8;, must always be running.)</para>

	  <para>To make a sysctl change permanent place the proper value
	    in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>.  More information

	<answer>
	  <para>Your motherboard lacks the external logic to support

	    determine if the external logic for cable detection (and
	    thus auto-termination) is available.  The driver simply
	    assumes that this support must exist if the configuration
	    contained in the serial EEPROM is set to <quote>automatic
	    termination</quote>.  Without the external cable detection

	  <para>The problem is that the application you are trying to
	    run is looking for a specific kernel symbol, but, for whatever
	    reason, cannot find it; this error stems from one of two
	    problems:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Your kernel and userland are not synchronized (i.e.,
		you built a new kernel but did not do an
		<maketarget>installworld</maketarget>, or vice versa),
		and thus the symbol table is different from what the
		user application thinks it is.  If this is the case,
		simply complete the upgrade process (see
		<filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> for the correct
		sequence).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>You are not using <command>/boot/loader</command> to
		load your kernel, but doing it directly from
		<filename>boot2</filename> (see &man.boot.8;).  While
		there is nothing wrong with bypassing
		<command>/boot/loader</command>, it generally does a
		better job of making the kernel symbols available to
		user applications.</para>

	<question id="connection-delay">
	  <para>Why does it take so long to connect to my computer via
	    <command>ssh</command> or <command>telnet</command>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The symptom: there is a long delay between the time the
	    TCP connection is established and the time when the client
	    software asks for a password (or, in &man.telnet.1;'s case,
	    when a login prompt appears).</para>

	  <para>The problem: more likely than not, the delay is caused
	    by the server software trying to resolve the client's IP
	    address into a hostname.  Many servers, including the
	    <application>Telnet</application> and
	    <application>SSH</application> servers that come with &os;,
	    do this in order to, among other things, store the hostname
	    in a log file for future reference by the
	    administrator.</para>

	  <para>The remedy: if the problem occurs whenever you connect
	    from your computer (the client) to any server, the problem is
	    with the client; likewise, if the problem only occurs when
	    someone connects to your computer (the server) the problem
	    is with the server.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the client, the only remedy is to
	    fix the DNS so the server can resolve it.  If this is on a
	    local network, consider it a server problem and keep
	    reading; conversely, if this is on the global Internet, you
	    will most likely need to contact your ISP and ask them to
	    fix it for you.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the server, and this is on a
	    local network, you need to configure the server to be able to
	    resolve address-to-hostname queries for your local address
	    range.  See the &man.hosts.5; and &man.named.8; manual pages
	    for more information.  If this is on the global Internet,
	    the problem may be that your server's resolver is not
	    functioning correctly.  To check, try to look up another
	    host &mdash; say, <hostid>www.yahoo.com</hostid>.  If it
	    does not work, that is your problem.</para>

	  <para>Following a fresh install of &os;, it is also possible
	    that domain and name server information is missing from
	    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  This will often
	    cause a delay in <application>SSH</application>, as the
	    option <literal>UseDNS</literal> is set to
	    <literal>yes</literal> by default in the
	    <filename>sshd_config</filename> file in
	    <filename class="directory">/etc/ssh</filename>.  If this is causing the
	    problem, you will either need to fill in the missing
	    information in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> or set
	    <literal>UseDNS</literal> to <literal>no</literal> in
	    <filename>sshd_config</filename> as a temporary
	    workaround.</para>

	    messages pounding the console?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There is a known problem when enabling &intel; Enhanced
	    SpeedStep from the BIOS: it causes the kernel to start printing
	    <errorname>calcru</errorname> messages like this:</para>

	  <screen>calcru: runtime went backwards from 6 usec to 3 usec for pid 37 (pagezero)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 6 usec to 3 usec for pid 36 (vmdaemon)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 170 usec to 138 usec for pid 35 (pagedaemon)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 553 usec to 291 usec for pid 15 (swi6: task queue)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 15521 usec to 10366 usec for pid 2 (g_event)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 25 usec to 12 usec for pid 11 (swi1: net)
calcru: runtime went backwards from 4417 usec to 3960 usec for pid 1 (init)

calcru: runtime went backwards from 408 usec to 204 usec for pid 0 (swapper)</screen>

	  <para>It is because &intel; SpeedStep (EIST) is incompatible
	    with some motherboards.</para>

	  <para>Workaround: Disable the EIST feature in the BIOS.  You

	<question id="computer-clock-skew">
	  <para>Why does the clock on my computer keep incorrect time?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Your computer has two or more clocks, and &os; has
	    chosen to use the wrong one.</para>

	  <para>Run &man.dmesg.8;, and check for lines that contain
	    <literal>Timecounter</literal>.  The one with the highest
	    quality value that &os; chose.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dmesg | grep Timecounter</userinput>

Timecounter "ACPI-fast" frequency 3579545 Hz quality 1000
Timecounter "TSC" frequency 2998570050 Hz quality 800
Timecounters tick every 1.000 msec</screen>

	  <para>You can confirm this by checking the
	    <varname>kern.timecounter.hardware</varname>
	    &man.sysctl.3;.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl kern.timecounter.hardware</userinput>
kern.timecounter.hardware: ACPI-fast</screen>

	  <para>It may be a broken ACPI timer.  The simplest solution is
	    to disable the ACPI timer in
	    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>debug.acpi.disabled="timer"</programlisting>

	  <para>Or the BIOS may modify the TSC clock&mdash;perhaps to
	    change the speed of the processor when running from batteries,
	    or going into a power saving mode, but &os; is unaware of
	    these adjustments, and appears to gain or lose time.</para>

	  <para>In this example, the <literal>i8254</literal> clock is
	    also available, and can be selected by writing its name to the
	    <varname>kern.timecounter.hardware</varname>

	  <para>What are <errorname>UDMA ICRC</errorname> errors, and

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &man.ata.4; driver reports <errorname>UDMA
	    ICRC</errorname> errors when a DMA transfer to or from a drive
	    is corrupted.  The driver will retry the operation a few
	    times.  Should the retries fail, it will switch from DMA to
	    the slower PIO mode of communication with the device.</para>

	  <para>The problem can be caused by many factors, although
	    perhaps the most common cause is faulty or incorrect
	    cabling.  Check that the ATA cables are undamaged and rated
	    for the Ultra&nbsp;DMA mode in use.  If you are using
	    removable drive trays, they must also be compatible.  Be
	    sure that all connections are making good contact.  Problems
	    have also been noticed when an old drive is installed on the
	    same ATA channel as an Ultra&nbsp;DMA&nbsp;66 (or faster)
	    drive.  Lastly, these errors can indicate that the drive is
	    failing.  Most drive vendors provide testing software for
	    their drives, so test your drive, and, if necessary, back up
	    your data and replace it.</para>

	  <para>The &man.atacontrol.8; utility can be used to show and
	    select the DMA or PIO modes used for each ATA device.  In
	    particular, <command>atacontrol mode
	    <replaceable>channel</replaceable></command> will show the
	    modes in use on a particular ATA channel, where the primary
	    channel is numbered 0, and so on.</para>

	  <para>What does <errorname>Called ...  with the following
	    non-sleepable locks held</errorname> mean?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This means that a function that may sleep was called
	    while a mutex (or other unsleepable) lock was held.</para>

	  <para>The reason this is an error is because mutexes are not
	    intended to be held for long periods of time; they are
	    supposed to only be held to maintain short periods of
	    synchronization.  This programming contract allows device
	    drivers to use mutexes to synchronize with the rest of the
	    kernel during interrupts.  Interrupts (under &os;) may not
	    sleep.  Hence it is imperative that no subsystem in the
	    kernel block for an extended period while holding a
	    mutex.</para>

	  <para>To catch such errors, assertions may be added to the
	    kernel that interact with the &man.witness.4; subsystem to
	    emit a warning or fatal error (depending on the system
	    configuration) when a potentially blocking call is made
	    while holding a mutex.</para>

	  <para>In summary, such warnings are non-fatal, however with
	    unfortunate timing they could cause undesirable effects
	    ranging from a minor blip in the system's responsiveness to
	    a complete system lockup.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>This error does not mean that the &man.touch.1; utility

	  <para>Please take a look at <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/ports/index.html">the ports page</ulink>
	    for info on software packages ported to &os;.  The list
	    currently tops &os.numports; and is growing daily, so come
	    back to check often or subscribe to the &a.announce; for
	    periodic updates on new entries.</para>

	  <para>Most ports should work on the

	    Each time a &os;
	    release is made, a snapshot of the ports tree at the time of
	    release in also included in the <filename class="directory">ports/</filename>
	    directory.</para>

	  <para>We also support the concept of a <quote>package</quote>,
	    essentially no more than a compressed binary distribution
	    with a little extra intelligence embedded in it for doing
	    whatever custom installation work is required.  A package
	    can be installed and uninstalled again easily without having
	    to know the gory details of which files it includes.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>If you are running a &os; version that lags

	<question id="make-index">
	  <para>I just tried to build <filename>INDEX</filename> using
	    <command>make <maketarget>index</maketarget></command>, and
	    it failed.  Why?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>First, always make sure that you have a completely
	    up-to-date Ports Collection.  Errors that affect building
	    <filename>INDEX</filename> from an up-to-date copy of the
	    Ports Collection are high-visibility and are thus almost
	    always fixed immediately.</para>

	  <para>However, if you are up-to-date, perhaps you are seeing
	    another problem.  <command>make <maketarget>index</maketarget></command>
	    has a known bug in dealing with incomplete copies of the
	    Ports Collection.  It assumes that you have a local copy of
	    every single port that every other port that you have a
	    local copy of depends on.  To explain, if you have a copy of
	    <filename>foo/bar</filename> on your disk, and
	    <filename>foo/bar</filename> depends on
	    <filename>baz/quux</filename>, then you must also have a
	    copy of <filename>baz/quux</filename> on your disk, and the
	    ports <filename>baz/quux</filename> depends on, and so on.
	    Otherwise, <command>make <maketarget>index</maketarget></command>
	    has insufficient information to create its dependency
	    tree.</para>

	  <para>This is particularly a problem for &os; users who
	    utilize &man.csup.1; to track the Ports
	    Collection but choose not to install certain categories by
	    specifying them in <filename>refuse</filename>.  In theory,
	    one should be able to refuse categories, but in practice
	    there are too many ports that depend on ports in other
	    categories.  Until someone comes up with a solution for this
	    problem, the general rule is that if you want to build
	    <filename>INDEX</filename>, you must have a complete copy of
	    the Ports Collection.</para>

	  <para>There are rare cases where <filename>INDEX</filename>
	    will not build due to odd cases involving
	    <makevar>WITH_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar> or
	    <makevar>WITHOUT_<replaceable>*</replaceable></makevar>
	    variables being set in <filename>make.conf</filename>.  If
	    you suspect that this is the case, please try to make
	    <filename>INDEX</filename> with those make variables turned
	    off before reporting it to &a.ports;.</para>

	<question id="cvsup-in-base">
	  <para>Why is <application>CVSup</application> not integrated
	    in the main &os; tree?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; base system is designed as self-hosting &mdash;
	    it should be possible to build the whole operating system
	    starting with a very limited set of tools.  Thus, the actual
	    build tools needed to compile the &os; sources are bundled
	    with the sources themselves.  This includes a C compiler
	    (&man.gcc.1;), &man.make.1;, &man.awk.1;, and similar
	    tools.</para>

	  <para>Since <application>CVSup</application> is written in
	    Modula-3, adding it to the &os; base system would also require
	    adding and maintaining a Modula-3 compiler.  This would lead
	    to both an increase in the disk space consumed by the &os;
	    sources and additional maintenance work.  Thus, it is much
	    easier for both the developers and users to keep
	    <application>CVSup</application> as a separate port, which
	    can be easily installed as a package bundled on the &os;
	    installation CDs.</para>

	  <para>However, &os; users are not without an integrated
	    <application>CVSup</application> compatible client anymore
	    since &os;&nbsp;6.2-RELEASE.  Thanks to &a.mux;,
	    <application>CVSup</application> was rewritten in C as
	    &man.csup.1; and it is the part of the base system by now.
	    Although it does not implement all the features of
	    <application>CVSup</application> at the moment, it is good
	    enough (and really fast!) to keep your sources synchronized.
	    For systems earlier than 6.2, it can be installed as a port
	    or package (see <filename

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Because &posix; says that there shall be such a
	    shell.</para>

	  <para>The more complicated answer: many people need to write
	    shell scripts which will be portable across many systems.
	    That is why &posix; specifies the shell and utility commands
	    in great detail.  Most scripts are written in Bourne shell,
	    and because several important programming interfaces
	    (&man.make.1;, &man.system.3;, &man.popen.3;, and analogues
	    in higher-level scripting languages like Perl and Tcl) are
	    specified to use the Bourne shell to interpret commands.
	    Because the Bourne shell is so often and widely used, it is
	    important for it to be quick to start, be deterministic in
	    its behavior, and have a small memory footprint.</para>

	  <para>The existing implementation is our best effort at
	    meeting as many of these requirements simultaneously as we
	    can.  In order to keep <command>/bin/sh</command> small, we
	    have not provided many of the convenience features that
	    other shells have.  That is why the Ports Collection
	    includes more featureful shells like
	    <command>bash</command>, <command>scsh</command>,
	    <command>tcsh</command>, and <command>zsh</command>.  (You
	    can compare for yourself the memory utilization of all these

	<question id="why-kernel-big">
	  <para>Why is my kernel so big (over 10&nbsp;MB)?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Chances are, you compiled your kernel in <emphasis>debug
	    mode</emphasis>.  Kernels built in debug mode contain many
	    symbols that are used for debugging, thus greatly increasing
	    the size of the kernel.  Note that there will be little or
	    no performance decrease from running a debug kernel, and it
	    is useful to keep one around in case of a system
	    panic.</para>

	  <para>However, if you are running low on disk space, or you
	    simply do not want to run a debug kernel, make sure that
	    both of the following are true:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>You do not have a line in your kernel configuration
		file that reads:</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>You are not running &man.config.8; with the
		<option>-g</option> option.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Either of the above settings will cause your kernel to
	    be built in debug mode.  As long as you make sure you follow
	    the steps above, you can build your kernel normally, and you
	    should notice a fairly large size decrease; most kernels
	    tend to be around 1.5&nbsp;MB to 2&nbsp;MB.</para>

	<question id="new-huge-disk">
	  <para>How do I move my system over to my huge new disk?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The best way is to reinstall the OS on the new disk,
	    then move the user data over.  This is highly recommended if
	    you have been tracking <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> for more
	    than one release, or have updated a release instead of
	    installing a new one.  You can install booteasy on both
	    disks with &man.boot0cfg.8;, and dual boot them until you
	    are happy with the new configuration.  Skip the next
	    paragraph to find out how to move the data after doing
	    this.</para>

	  <para>Should you decide not to do a fresh install, you need to
	    partition and label the new disk with either
	    &man.sysinstall.8;, or &man.fdisk.8; and &man.disklabel.8;.
	    You should also install booteasy on both disks with
	    &man.boot0cfg.8;, so that you can dual boot to the old or
	    new system after the copying is done.  See the <ulink
	      url="&url.articles.formatting-media;/index.html">formatting-media article</ulink>
	    for details on this process.</para>

	  <para>Now you have the new disk set up, and are ready to move
	    the data.  Unfortunately, you cannot just blindly copy the
	    data.  Things like device files (in
	    <filename class="directory">/dev</filename>), flags, and links tend to screw
	    that up.  You need to use tools that understand these
	    things, which means &man.dump.8;.  Although it is suggested
	    that you move the data in single user mode, it is not
	    required.</para>

	  <para>You should never use anything but &man.dump.8; and
	    &man.restore.8; to move the root file system.  The
	    &man.tar.1; command may work &mdash; then again, it may not.
	    You should also use &man.dump.8; and &man.restore.8; if you
	    are moving a single partition to another empty partition.
	    The sequence of steps to use <command>dump</command> to move
	    a partitions data to a new partition is:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para><command>newfs</command> the new partition.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>mount</command> it on a temporary mount
		point.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>cd</command> to that directory.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>dump</command> the old partition, piping
		output to the new one.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>For example, if you are going to move root to
	    <devicename>/dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable></devicename>,
	    with <filename class="directory"><replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></filename> as
	    the temporary mount point, it is:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Rearranging your partitions with <command>dump</command>
	    takes a bit more work.  To merge a partition like
	    <filename class="directory">/var</filename> into its parent, create the new
	    partition large enough for both, move the parent partition
	    as described above, then move the child partition into the
	    empty directory that the first move created:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - /var | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>To split a directory from its parent, say putting
	    <filename class="directory">/var</filename> on its own partition when it was
	    not before, create both partitions, then mount the child
	    partition on the appropriate directory in the temporary
	    mount point, then move the old single partition:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1d</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1a</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable>/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/<replaceable>ad1s1d</replaceable> <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable>/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd <replaceable>/mnt</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You might prefer &man.cpio.1;, &man.pax.1;, &man.tar.1;
	    to &man.dump.8; for user data.  At the time of this writing,
	    these are known to lose file flag information, so use them

	<question id="dangerously-dedicated">
	  <para>Will a <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk
	    endanger my health?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><anchor id="dedicate">The installation procedure allows
	    you to chose two different methods in partitioning your hard
	    disk(s).  The default way makes it compatible with other
	    operating systems on the same machine, by using
	    &man.fdisk.8; table entries (called <quote>slices</quote> in
	    &os;), with a &os; slice that employs partitions of its own.
	    Optionally, one can chose to install a boot-selector to
	    switch between the possible operating systems on the
	    disk(s).  The alternative uses the entire disk for &os;, and
	    makes no attempt to be compatible with other operating
	    systems.</para>

	  <para>So why it is called <quote>dangerous</quote>?  A disk in
	    this mode does not contain what normal PC utilities would
	    consider a valid &man.fdisk.8; table.  Depending on how well
	    they have been designed, they might complain at you once
	    they are getting in contact with such a disk, or even worse,
	    they might damage the BSD bootstrap without even asking or
	    notifying you.  In addition, the <quote>dangerously
	    dedicated</quote> disk's layout is known to confuse many
	    BIOSes, including those from AWARD (e.g. as found in HP
	    Netserver and Micronics systems as well as many others) and
	    Symbios/NCR (for the popular 53C8xx range of SCSI
	    controllers).  This is not a complete list, there are more.
	    Symptoms of this confusion include the <errorname>read
	    error</errorname> message printed by the &os; bootstrap when
	    it cannot find itself, as well as system lockups when
	    booting.</para>

	  <para>Why have this mode at all then?  It only saves a few
	    kbytes of disk space, and it can cause real problems for a new
	    installation.  <quote>Dangerously dedicated</quote> mode's
	    origins lie in a desire to avoid one of the most common
	    problems plaguing new &os; installers &mdash; matching the
	    BIOS <quote>geometry</quote> numbers for a disk to the disk
	    itself.</para>

	  <para><quote>Geometry</quote> is an outdated concept, but one
	    still at the heart of the PC's BIOS and its interaction with
	    disks.  When the &os; installer creates slices, it has to
	    record the location of these slices on the disk in a fashion
	    that corresponds with the way the BIOS expects to find them.
	    If it gets it wrong, you will not be able to boot.</para>

	  <para><quote>Dangerously dedicated</quote> mode tries to work
	    around this by making the problem simpler.  In some cases,
	    it gets it right.  But it is meant to be used as a
	    last-ditch alternative &mdash; there are better ways to
	    solve the problem 99 times out of 100.</para>

	  <para>So, how do you avoid the need for <quote>DD</quote> mode
	    when you are installing?  Start by making a note of the
	    geometry that your BIOS claims to be using for your disks.
	    You can arrange to have the kernel print this as it boots by
	    specifying <option>-v</option> at the
	    <literal>boot:</literal> prompt, or using
	    <command>boot -v</command> in the loader.  Just before the
	    installer starts, the kernel will print a list of BIOS
	    geometries.  Do not panic &mdash; wait for the installer to
	    start and then use scrollback to read the numbers.
	    Typically the BIOS disk units will be in the same order that
	    &os; lists your disks, first IDE, then SCSI.</para>

	  <para>When you are slicing up your disk, check that the disk
	    geometry displayed in the FDISK screen is correct (ie.  it
	    matches the BIOS numbers); if it is wrong, use the
	    <keycap>G</keycap> key to fix it.  You may have to do this
	    if there is absolutely nothing on the disk, or if the disk
	    has been moved from another system.  Note that this is only
	    an issue with the disk that you are going to boot from; &os;
	    will sort itself out just fine with any other disks you may
	    have.</para>

	  <para>Once you have got the BIOS and &os; agreeing about the
	    geometry of the disk, your problems are almost guaranteed to
	    be over, and with no need for <quote>DD</quote> mode at all.
	    If, however, you are still greeted with the dreaded
	    <errorname>read error</errorname> message when you try to
	    boot, it is time to cross your fingers and go for it &mdash; there
	    is nothing left to lose.</para>

	  <para>To return a <quote>dangerously dedicated</quote> disk
	    for normal PC use, there are basically two options.  The
	    first is, you write enough NULL bytes over the MBR to make
	    any subsequent installation believe this to be a blank disk.
	    You can do this for example with the following
	    command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<replaceable>rda0</replaceable> count=15</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Alternatively, the undocumented DOS
	    <quote>feature</quote></para>

	  <screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>fdisk /mbr</userinput></screen>

	  <para>will to install a new master boot record as well, thus
	    clobbering the BSD bootstrap.</para>

	<question id="safe-softupdates">
	  <para>Which partitions can safely use Soft Updates?  I have
	    heard that Soft Updates on <filename class="directory">/</filename> can cause
	    problems.</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: you can usually use Soft Updates safely on
	    all partitions.</para>

	  <para>Long answer: There used to be some concern over using
	    Soft Updates on the root partition.  Soft Updates has two
	    characteristics that caused this.  First, a Soft Updates
	    partition has a small chance of losing data during a system
	    crash.  (The partition will not be corrupted; the data will
	    simply be lost.) Also, Soft Updates can cause temporary
	    space shortages.</para>

	  <para>When using Soft Updates, the kernel can take up to
	    thirty seconds to actually write changes to the physical
	    disk.  If you delete a large file, the file still resides on
	    disk until the kernel actually performs the deletion.  This
	    can cause a very simple race condition.  Suppose you delete
	    one large file and immediately create another large file.
	    The first large file is not yet actually removed from the
	    physical disk, so the disk might not have enough room for
	    the second large file.  You get an error that the partition
	    does not have enough space, although you know perfectly well
	    that you just released a large chunk of space!  When you try
	    again mere seconds later, the file creation works as you
	    expect.  This has left more than one user scratching his
	    head and doubting his sanity, the &os; file system, or
	    both.</para>

	  <para>If a system should crash after the kernel accepts a
	    chunk of data for writing to disk, but before that data is
	    actually written out, data could be lost or corrupted.  This
	    risk is extremely small, but generally manageable.  Use of
	    IDE write caching greatly increases this risk; it is
	    strongly recommended that you disable IDE write caching when
	    using Soft Updates.</para>

	  <para>These issues affect all partitions using Soft Updates.
	    So, what does this mean for the root partition?</para>

	  <para>Vital information on the root partition changes very
	    rarely.  Files such as
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename> and the contents of
	    <filename class="directory">/etc</filename> only change during system
	    maintenance, or when users change their passwords.  If the
	    system crashed during the thirty-second window after such a
	    change is made, it is possible that data could be lost.
	    This risk is negligible for most applications, but you
	    should be aware that it exists.  If your system cannot
	    tolerate this much risk, do not use Soft Updates on the root
	    file system!</para>

	  <para><filename class="directory">/</filename> is traditionally one of the
	    smallest partitions.  If you put the
	    <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> directory on
	    <filename class="directory">/</filename> and you have a busy
	    <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>, you might see intermittent space
	    problems.  Symlinking <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> to
	    <filename class="directory">/var/tmp</filename> will solve this

	    DOS/&windowsnt; partition.  Assuming you name that file
	    something like <filename>c:\bootsect.bsd</filename>
	    (inspired by <filename>c:\bootsect.dos</filename>), you can
	    then edit the <filename>c:\boot.ini</filename> file to come
	    up with something like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT"
C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="&os;"
C:\="DOS"</programlisting>

	  <para>If &os; is installed on the same disk as the &windowsnt;
	    boot partition simply copy <filename>/boot/boot1</filename> to
	    <filename>C:\BOOTSECT.BSD</filename>.  However, if &os; is
	    installed on a different disk
	    <filename>/boot/boot1</filename> will not work,
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> is needed.</para>

	  <para><filename>/boot/boot0</filename> needs to be installed
	    using &man.sysinstall.8; by selecting the &os; boot manager
	    on the screen which asks if you wish to use a boot manager.
	    This is because <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> has the
	    partition table area filled with NULL characters but
	    &man.sysinstall.8; copies the partition table before copying
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> to the MBR.</para>

	    <warning>
	      <para><emphasis>Do not simply copy
		<filename>/boot/boot0</filename> instead of
		<filename>/boot/boot1</filename>; you will overwrite
		your partition table and render your computer
		un-bootable!</emphasis></para>
	    </warning>

	  <para>When the &os; boot manager runs it records the last OS
	    booted by setting the active flag on the partition table
	    entry for that OS and then writes the whole 512-bytes of
	    itself back to the MBR so if you just copy
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> to
	    <filename>C:\BOOTSECT.BSD</filename> then it writes an empty
	    partition table, with the active flag set on one entry, to
	    the MBR.</para>

	<question id="lilo-bootloader">
	  <para>How do I boot &os; and &linux; from LILO?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>If you have &os; and &linux; on the same disk, just
	    follow LILO's installation instructions for booting a
	    non-&linux; operating system.  Very briefly, these
	    are:</para>

	  <para>Boot &linux;, and add the following lines to
	    <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>other=/dev/hda2
        table=/dev/hda
        label=&os;</programlisting>

	  <para>(the above assumes that your &os; slice is known to
	    &linux; as <devicename>/dev/hda2</devicename>; tailor to
	    suit your setup).  Then, run <command>lilo</command> as
	    <username>root</username> and you should be done.</para>

	  <para>If &os; resides on another disk, you need to add
	    <literal>loader=/boot/chain.b</literal> to the LILO entry.
	    For example:</para>

	  <programlisting>other=/dev/dab4
        table=/dev/dab
        loader=/boot/chain.b
        label=&os;</programlisting>

	  <para>In some cases you may need to specify the BIOS drive
	    number to the &os; boot loader to successfully boot off the
	    second disk.  For example, if your &os; SCSI disk is probed
	    by BIOS as BIOS disk 1, at the &os; boot loader prompt you
	    need to specify:</para>

	  <screen>Boot: <userinput>1:da(0,a)/boot/kernel/kernel</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You can configure &man.boot.8; to automatically do this
	    for you at boot time.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>Booting &os; using GRUB is very simple.  Just add the
	    following to your configuration file
	    <filename>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filename> (or
	    <filename>/boot/grub/grub.conf</filename> in some systems,

	kernel /boot/loader
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>Where <replaceable>hd0,a</replaceable> points to your
	    root partition on the first disk.  If you need to specify
	    which slice number should be used, use something like this
	    <replaceable>(hd0,2,a)</replaceable>.  By default, if the
	    slice number is omitted, GRUB searches the first slice which
	    has <literal>a</literal> partition.</para>

	<question id="removable-drives">
	  <para>I have a new removable drive, how do I use it?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Whether it is a removable drive like a &iomegazip; or an
	    EZ drive (or even a floppy, if you want to use it that way),
	    or a new hard disk, once it is installed and recognized by
	    the system, and you have your cartridge/floppy/whatever
	    slotted in, things are pretty much the same for all
	    devices.</para>

	  <para>(this section is based on <ulink
	      url="http://www.vmunix.com/mark/FreeBSD/ZIP-FAQ.html">Mark Mayo's ZIP FAQ</ulink>)
	    </para>

	  <para>If it is a ZIP drive or a floppy, you have already got a
	    DOS file system on it, you can use a command like this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/fd0c /floppy</userinput></screen>

	  <para>if it is a floppy, or this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/da2s4 /zip</userinput></screen>

	  <para>for a ZIP disk with the factory configuration.</para>

	  <para>For other disks, see how they are laid out using
	    &man.fdisk.8; or &man.sysinstall.8;.</para>

	  <para>The rest of the examples will be for a ZIP drive on
	    <devicename>da2</devicename>, the third SCSI disk.</para>

	  <para>Unless it is a floppy, or a removable you plan on
	    sharing with other people, it is probably a better idea to
	    stick a BSD file system on it.  You will get long filename
	    support, at least a 2X improvement in performance, and a lot
	    more stability.  First, you need to redo the DOS-level
	    partitions/file systems.  You can either use &man.fdisk.8;
	    or &man.sysinstall.8;, or for a small drive that you do not
	    want to bother with multiple operating system support on,
	    just blow away the whole FAT partition table (slices) and
	    just use the BSD partitioning:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rda2 count=2</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -Brw da2 auto</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You can use &man.disklabel.8; or &man.sysinstall.8; to
	    create multiple BSD partitions.  You will certainly want to
	    do this if you are adding swap space on a fixed disk, but it
	    is probably irrelevant on a removable drive like a
	    ZIP.</para>

	  <para>Finally, create a new file system, this one is on our
	    ZIP drive using the whole disk:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/rda2c</userinput></screen>

	  <para>and mount it:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/da2c /zip</userinput></screen>

	  <para>and it is probably a good idea to add a line like this
	    to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> (see &man.fstab.5;) so
	    you can just type <command>mount /zip</command> in the
	    future:</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Ordinary users can be permitted to mount devices.  Here
	    is how:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>As <username>root</username> set the sysctl variable
		<varname>vfs.usermount</varname> to
		<literal>1</literal>.</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w vfs.usermount=1</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>As <username>root</username> assign the appropriate
		permissions to the block device associated with the
		removable media.</para>

	      <para>For example, to allow users to mount the first
		floppy drive, use:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 666 /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	      <para>To allow users in the group
		<groupname>operator</groupname> to mount the CD-ROM

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chgrp operator /dev/acd0c</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 640 /dev/acd0c</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>You will need to alter
		<filename>/etc/devfs.conf</filename> to make these
		changes permanent across reboots.</para>

	      <para>As <username>root</username>, add the necessary
		lines to <filename>/etc/devfs.conf</filename>.  For
		example, to allow users to mount the first floppy drive
		add:</para>

	      <programlisting># Allow all users to mount the floppy disk.
own       /dev/fd0	  root:operator
perm      /dev/fd0	  0666</programlisting>

	      <para>To allow users in the group

		add:</para>

	      <programlisting># Allow members of the group operator to mount CD-ROMs.
own       /dev/acd0	  root:operator
perm      /dev/acd0	  0660</programlisting>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Finally, add the line
		<literal><varname>vfs.usermount</varname>=1</literal> to
		the file <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> so that
		it is reset at system boot time.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>All users can now mount the floppy

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mkdir <replaceable>~/my-mount-point</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/fd0 <replaceable>~/my-mount-point</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>Users in group <groupname>operator</groupname> can now
	    mount the CD-ROM <devicename>/dev/acd0c</devicename> onto a
	    directory that they own:</para>

&prompt.user; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/acd0c <replaceable>~/my-mount-point</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>Unmounting the device is simple:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>umount <replaceable>~/my-mount-point</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>Enabling <varname>vfs.usermount</varname>, however, has
	    negative security implications.  A better way to access

	    commands show different amounts of disk space available.
	    What is going on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>You need to understand what <command>du</command> and
	    <command>df</command> really do.  <command>du</command> goes
	    through the directory tree, measures how large each file is,
	    and presents the totals.  <command>df</command> just asks
	    the file system how much space it has left.  They seem to be
	    the same thing, but a file without a directory entry will
	    affect <command>df</command> but not
	    <command>du</command>.</para>

	  <para>When a program is using a file, and you delete the file,
	    the file is not really removed from the file system until
	    the program stops using it.  The file is immediately deleted
	    from the directory listing, however.  You can see this
	    easily enough with a program such as
	    <command>more</command>.  Assume you have a file large
	    enough that its presence affects the output of
	    <command>du</command> and <command>df</command>.  (Since
	    disks can be so large today, this might be a
	    <emphasis>very</emphasis> large file!) If you delete this
	    file while using <command>more</command> on it,
	    <command>more</command> does not immediately choke and
	    complain that it cannot view the file.  The entry is simply
	    removed from the directory so no other program or user can
	    access it.  <command>du</command> shows that it is gone
	    &mdash; it has walked the directory tree and the file is not
	    listed.  <command>df</command> shows that it is still there,
	    as the file system knows that <command>more</command> is
	    still using that space.  Once you end the
	    <command>more</command> session, <command>du</command> and
	    <command>df</command> will agree.</para>

	  <para>Note that Soft Updates can delay the freeing of disk
	    space; you might need to wait up to 30 seconds for the

	  <para>This situation is common on web servers.  Many people
	    set up a &os; web server and forget to rotate the log files.
	    The access log fills up <filename class="directory">/var</filename>.  The new
	    administrator deletes the file, but the system still
	    complains that the partition is full.  Stopping and
	    restarting the web server program would free the file,
	    allowing the system to release the disk space.  To prevent
	    this from happening, set up &man.newsyslog.8;.</para>

	<question id="root-not-found-cron-errors">
	  <para>Why do I keep getting messages like <errorname>root: not
	    found</errorname> after editing my
	    <filename>crontab</filename> file?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is normally caused by editing the system crontab
	    (<filename>/etc/crontab</filename>) and then using
	    &man.crontab.1; to install it:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>crontab /etc/crontab</userinput></screen>

	  <para>This is not the correct way to do things.  The system
	    crontab has a different format to the per-user crontabs
	    which &man.crontab.1; updates (the &man.crontab.5; manual
	    page explains the differences in more detail).</para>

	  <para>If this is what you did, the extra crontab is simply a
	    copy of <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> in the wrong
	    format it.  Delete it with the command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>crontab -r</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Next time, when you edit
	    <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>, you should not do
	    anything to inform &man.cron.8; of the changes, since it
	    will notice them automatically.</para>

	  <para>If you want something to be run once per day, week, or
	    month, it is probably better to add shell scripts
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/etc/periodic</filename>, and let the
	    &man.periodic.8; command run from the system
	    <command>cron</command> schedule it with the other periodic
	    system tasks.</para>

	  <para>The actual reason for the error is that the system
	    crontab has an extra field, specifying which user to run the
	    command as.  In the default system crontab provided with
	    &os;, this is <username>root</username> for all entries.
	    When this crontab is used as the <username>root</username>
	    user's crontab (which is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same
	    as the system crontab), &man.cron.8; assumes the string
	    <literal>root</literal> is the first word of the command to
	    execute, but no such command exists.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is a security feature.  In order to

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Restart the system using <userinput>boot -s</userinput>
	    at the loader prompt to enter Single User mode.  When
	    prompted for a shell pathname, simply press

	    where your favorite editor is defined.  If your favorite
	    editor is on a network file system, you will need to either
	    configure the network manually before you can mount network
	    file systems, or use an editor which resides on a local file
	    system, such as &man.ed.1;.</para>

	  <para>If you intend to use a full screen editor such as

	  <para>Once you have performed these steps, you can edit

	    <emphasis>-RC</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>!  What is going on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: it is just a name.
	    <emphasis>RC</emphasis> stands for <quote>Release
	    Candidate</quote>.  It signifies that a release is imminent.
	    In &os;, <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis> is typically
	    synonymous with the code freeze before a release.  (For some
	    releases, the <emphasis>-BETA</emphasis> label was used in
	    the same way as <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>.)</para>

	  <para>Long answer: &os; derives its releases from one of two
	    places.  Major, dot-zero, releases, such as 7.0-RELEASE and
	    8.0-RELEASE, are branched from the head of the development
	    stream, commonly referred to as <link
	    linkend="current">-CURRENT</link>.  Minor releases, such as
	    6.3-RELEASE or 5.2-RELEASE, have been snapshots of the
	    active <link linkend="stable">-STABLE</link> branch.
	    Starting with 4.3-RELEASE, each release also now has its own
	    branch which can be tracked by people requiring an extremely
	    conservative rate of development (typically only security
	    advisories).</para>

	  <para>When a release is about to be made, the branch from
	    which it will be derived from has to undergo a certain
	    process.  Part of this process is a code freeze.  When a
	    code freeze is initiated, the name of the branch is changed
	    to reflect that it is about to become a release.  For
	    example, if the branch used to be called 6.2-STABLE, its
	    name will be changed to 6.3-PRERELEASE to signify the code
	    freeze and signify that extra pre-release testing should be
	    happening.  Bug fixes can still be committed to be part of
	    the release.  When the source code is in shape for the
	    release the name will be changed to 6.3-RC to signify that a
	    release is about to be made from it.  Once in the RC stage,
	    only the most critical bugs found can be fixed.  Once the
	    release (6.3-RELEASE in this example) and release branch

	<answer>
	  <para>No, there is no memory leak, and it is not using

	    <listitem>
	      <para><literal>Free</literal>: pages without data content,

	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Pages are most often written to disk (sort of a VM sync)
	    when they are in the inactive state, but active pages can
	    also be synced.  This depends upon the CPU tracking of the
	    modified bit being available, and in certain situations
	    there can be an advantage for a block of VM pages to be
	    synced, whether they are active or inactive.  In most common
	    cases, it is best to think of the inactive queue to be a
	    queue of relatively unused pages that might or might not be
	    in the process of being written to disk.  Cached pages are
	    already synced, not mapped, but available for immediate
	    process use with their old association or with a new

<!-- Provided by John Dyson via Usenet -->
	<answer>
	  <para>There are a couple of kinds of <quote>free

	    immediately available without paging anything else out.
	    That is approximately the size of cache queue + size of free

	    tuning).  Another kind of <quote>free memory</quote> is the
	    total amount of <acronym>VM</acronym> space.  That can be
	    complex, but is dependent upon the amount of swap space and
	    memory.  Other kinds of <quote>free memory</quote>
	    descriptions are also possible, but it is relatively useless
	    to define these, but rather it is important to make sure

	<answer>
	  <para>Virtual consoles, put simply, enable you to have several
	    simultaneous sessions on the same machine without doing
	    anything complicated like setting up a network or running
	    X.</para>

	  <para>When the system starts, it will display a login prompt
	    on the monitor after displaying all the boot messages.  You
	    can then type in your login name and password and start
	    working (or playing!) on the first virtual console.</para>

	  <para>At some point, you will probably wish to start another
	    session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program you
	    are running or to read your mail while waiting for an FTP
	    transfer to finish.  Just do <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>
	    (hold down the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key and press the
	    <keycap>F2</keycap> key), and you will find a login prompt
	    waiting for you on the second <quote>virtual
	    console</quote>!  When you want to go back to the original
	    session, do <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.
	    </para>

	  <para>The default &os; installation has eight virtual consoles
	    enabled.  <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F3</keycap></keycombo>,
	    and so on will switch between these virtual consoles.</para>

	  <para>To enable more of them, edit
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;) and add
	    entries for <devicename>ttyv8</devicename> to
	    <devicename>ttyvc</devicename> after the comment on
	    <quote>Virtual terminals</quote>:</para>

	  <programlisting># Edit the existing entry for ttyv8 in /etc/ttys and change
# "off" to "on".
ttyv8   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure</programlisting>

	  <para>Use as many or as few as you want.  The more virtual
	    terminals you have, the more resources that are used; this
	    can be important if you have 8&nbsp;MB RAM or less.  You may
	    also want to change the <literal>secure</literal> to
	    <literal>insecure</literal>.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>If you want to run an X server you
	      <emphasis>must</emphasis> leave at least one virtual
	      terminal unused (or turned off) for it to use.  That is to
	      say that if you want to have a login prompt pop up for all
	      twelve of your Alt-function keys, you are out of luck
	      &mdash; you can only do this for eleven of them if you
	      also want to run an X server on the same machine.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>The easiest way to disable a console is by turning it
	    off.  For example, if you had the full 12 terminal
	    allocation mentioned above and you wanted to run X, you
	    would change settings for virtual terminal 12 from:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure</programlisting>

	  <para>to:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure</programlisting>

	  <para>If your keyboard has only ten function keys, you would
	    end up with:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure</programlisting>

	  <para>(You could also just delete these lines.)</para>

	  <para>Next, the easiest (and cleanest) way to activate the
	    virtual consoles is to reboot.  However, if you really do
	    not want to reboot, you can just shut down the X Window

	<answer>
	  <para>Use <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F<replaceable>n</replaceable></keycap></keycombo>
	    to switch back to a virtual console.  <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>
	    would return you to the first virtual console.</para>

	  <para>Once you are back to a text console, you can then use
	    <keycombo
	      action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F<replaceable>n</replaceable></keycap></keycombo>
	    as normal to move between them.</para>

	  <para>To return to the X session, you must switch to the
	    virtual console running X.  If you invoked X from the
	    command line, (e.g., using <command>startx</command>) then
	    the X session will attach to the next unused virtual
	    console, not the text console from which it was invoked.  If
	    you have eight active virtual terminals then X will be
	    running on the ninth, and you would use <keycombo

	<question id="xdm-boot">
	  <para>How do I start <application>XDM</application> on
	    boot?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There are two schools of thought on how to start
	    &man.xdm.1;.  One school starts <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;) using the
	    supplied example, while the other simply runs
	    <command>xdm</command> from from
	    <filename>rc.local</filename> (see &man.rc.8;) or from an
	    <filename>X</filename> script in
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename>.  Both are equally
	    valid, and one may work in situations where the other does
	    not.  In both cases the result is the same: X will pop up a
	    graphical login prompt.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ttys.5; method has the advantage of documenting
	    which vty X will start on and passing the responsibility of
	    restarting the X server on logout to &man.init.8;.  The
	    &man.rc.8; method makes it easy to <command>kill</command>
	    <command>xdm</command> if there is a problem starting the X
	    server.</para>

	  <para>If loaded from &man.rc.8;, <command>xdm</command> should
	    be started without any arguments (i.e., as a daemon).  The
	    <command>xdm</command> command must start
	    <emphasis>after</emphasis> &man.getty.8; runs, or else
	    <command>getty</command> and <command>xdm</command> will
	    conflict, locking out the console.  The best way around this
	    is to have the script sleep 10 seconds or so then launch
	    <command>xdm</command>.</para>

	  <para>If you are to start <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>, there still is a chance of
	    conflict between <command>xdm</command> and &man.getty.8;.
	    One way to avoid this is to add the <literal>vt</literal>
	    number in the
	    <filename>/usr/local/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</filename>
	    file:</para>

	  <programlisting>:0 local /usr/local/bin/X vt4</programlisting>

	  <para>The above example will direct the X server to run in
	    <devicename>/dev/ttyv3</devicename>.  Note the number is
	    offset by one.  The X server counts the vty from one,
	    whereas the &os; kernel numbers the vty from zero.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>If you start <application>X</application> with
	    <command>startx</command>, the permissions on

	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> get changed, resulting in things
	    like <command>xterm -C</command> and
	    <command>xconsole</command> not working.</para>

	  <para>This is because of the way console permissions are set
	    by default.  On a multi-user system, one does not
	    necessarily want just any user to be able to write on the
	    system console.  For users who are logging directly onto a
	    machine with a VTY, the &man.fbtab.5; file exists to solve
	    such problems.</para>

	  <para>In a nutshell, make sure an uncommented line of the form
	    is in <filename>/etc/fbtab</filename> (see
	    &man.fbtab.5;):</para>

	  <programlisting>/dev/ttyv0 0600 /dev/console</programlisting>

	  <para>It will ensure that whomever logs in on

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>All X servers need to be run as
	    <username>root</username> in order to get direct access to
	    your video hardware.</para>

	  <para>There are two ways to be able to use &xorg;
	    as a regular user.  The first is to use
	    <command>xdm</command> or another display manager (e.g.,
	    <command>kdm</command>); the second is to use the
	    <command>Xwrapper</command>.</para>

	  <para><command>xdm</command> is a daemon that handles
	    graphical logins.  It is usually started at boot time, and is
	    responsible for authenticating users and starting their
	    sessions; it is essentially the graphical counterpart of
	    &man.getty.8; and &man.login.1;.  For more information on
	    <command>xdm</command> see <ulink
	      url="http://www.x.org/wiki/UserDocumentation">the &xorg; documentation</ulink>,
	    and the <link
	      linkend="xdm-boot">the FAQ entry</link> on it.</para>

	  <para><command>Xwrapper</command> is the X server wrapper; it
	    is a small utility to enable one to manually run an X server
	    while maintaining reasonable safety.  It performs some
	    sanity checks on the command line arguments given, and if
	    they pass, runs the appropriate X server.  If you do not
	    want to run a display manager for whatever reason, this is
	    for you.  If you have installed the complete Ports
	    Collection, you can find the port in <filename

	  <para>Yes.  All you need to do is use &man.xmodmap.1; to

	  <para>Assuming all <quote>Windows</quote> keyboards are

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><keycode>115</keycode> &mdash;
		<keycap>Windows</keycap> key, between the left-hand

		key, to the left of the right-hand <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
		key</para>
	    </listitem>

	    comma, try this.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = comma"</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You will probably have to re-start your window manager
	    to see the result.</para>

	  <para>To have the <keycap>Windows</keycap> key-mappings
	    enabled automatically every time you start X either put the
	    <command>xmodmap</command> commands in your
	    <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename> file or, preferably, create
	    a file <filename>~/.xmodmaprc</filename> and include the

	    the following line to your
	    <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmaprc</programlisting>

	  <para>For example, you could map the 3 keys to be
	    <keycap>F13</keycap>, <keycap>F14</keycap>, and
	    <keycap>F15</keycap>, respectively.  This would make it easy
	    to map them to useful functions within applications or your
	    window manager, as demonstrated further down.</para>

	  <para>To do this put the following in
	    <filename>~/.xmodmaprc</filename>.</para>

	  <programlisting>keycode 115 = F13
keycode 116 = F14
keycode 117 = F15</programlisting>

	  <para>If you use the <filename
	      role="package">x11-wm/fvwm2</filename> port, for example,
	    you could map the keys so that <keycap>F13</keycap>
	    iconifies (or de-iconifies) the window the cursor is in,
	    <keycap>F14</keycap> brings the window the cursor is in to
	    the front or, if it is already at the front, pushes it to
	    the back, and <keycap>F15</keycap> pops up the main
	    Workplace (application) menu even if the cursor is not on
	    the desktop, which is useful if you do not have any part of
	    the desktop visible (and the logo on the key matches its
	    functionality).</para>

	  <para>The following entries in <filename>~/.fvwmrc</filename>
	    implement the aforementioned setup:</para>

	  <programlisting>Key F13        FTIWS    A        Iconify

	  <para>Why is my <command>ipfw</command> <quote>fwd</quote>
	    rule to redirect a service to another machine not
	    working?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Possibly because you want to do network address
	    translation (NAT) and not just forward packets.  A
	    <quote>fwd</quote> rule does exactly what it says; it
	    forwards packets.  It does not actually change the data
	    inside the packet.  Say we have a rule like:</para>

	  <screen>01000 fwd <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable> from any to <replaceable>foo 21</replaceable></screen>

	  <para>When a packet with a destination address of
	    <replaceable>foo</replaceable> arrives at the machine with
	    this rule, the packet is forwarded to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>, but it still has the
	    destination address of <replaceable>foo</replaceable>!  The
	    destination address of the packet is
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> changed to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>.  Most machines would
	    probably drop a packet that they receive with a destination
	    address that is not their own.  Therefore, using a
	    <quote>fwd</quote> rule does not often work the way the user
	    expects.  This behavior is a feature and not a bug.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is the kernel telling you that some activity is
	    provoking it to send more ICMP or TCP reset (RST) responses
	    than it thinks it should.  ICMP responses are often
	    generated as a result of attempted connections to unused UDP
	    ports.  TCP resets are generated as a result of attempted
	    connections to unopened TCP ports.  Among others, these are
	    the kinds of activities which may cause these
	    messages:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Brute-force denial of service (DoS) attacks (as
		opposed to single-packet attacks which exploit a
		specific vulnerability).</para>

		number of ports (as opposed to only trying a few
		well-known ports).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>The first number in the message tells you how many
	    packets the kernel would have sent if the limit was not in
	    place, and the second number tells you the limit.  You can
	    control the limit using the
	    <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname> sysctl variable
	    like this, where <literal>300</literal> is the limit in
	    packets per second:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.icmplim=300</userinput></screen>

	  <para>If you do not want to see messages about this in your
	    log files, but you still want the kernel to do response
	    limiting, you can use the
	    <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output</varname> sysctl
	    variable to disable the output like this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output=0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Finally, if you want to disable response limiting, you
	    can set the <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname> sysctl
	    variable (see above for an example) to <literal>0</literal>.

	  <para><quote>Sandbox</quote> is a security term.  It can mean
	    two things:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>A process which is placed inside a set of virtual
		walls that are designed to prevent someone who breaks
		into the process from being able to break into the wider
		system.</para>

	      <para>The process is said to be able to
		<quote>play</quote> inside the walls.  That is, nothing
		the process does in regards to executing code is
		supposed to be able to breech the walls so you do not
		have to do a detailed audit of its code to be able to
		say certain things about its security.</para>

	      <para>The walls might be a user&nbsp;ID, for example.
		This is the definition used in the &man.security.7; and
		&man.named.8; man pages.</para>

	      <para>Take the <literal>ntalk</literal> service, for
		example (see &man.inetd.8;).  This service used to run
		as user&nbsp;ID <username>root</username>.  Now it runs
		as user&nbsp;ID <username>tty</username>.  The
		<username>tty</username> user is a sandbox designed to
		make it more difficult for someone who has successfully
		hacked into the system via <literal>ntalk</literal> from
		being able to hack beyond that user&nbsp;ID.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>A process which is placed inside a simulation of the
		machine.  This is more hard-core.  Basically it means
		that someone who is able to break into the process may
		believe that he can break into the wider machine but is,
		in fact, only breaking into a simulation of that machine
		and not modifying any real data.</para>

	      <para>The most common way to accomplish this is to build a
		simulated environment in a subdirectory and then run the
		processes in that directory chroot'd (i.e. <filename
		  class="directory">/</filename> for that process is this
		directory, not the real <filename
		  class="directory">/</filename> of the system).</para>

	      <para>Another common use is to mount an underlying file
		system read-only and then create a file system layer on
		top of it that gives a process a seemingly writeable
		view into that file system.  The process may believe it
		is able to write to those files, but only the process
		sees the effects &mdash; other processes in the system
		do not, necessarily.</para>

	      <para>An attempt is made to make this sort of sandbox so
		transparent that the user (or hacker) does not realize
		that he is sitting in it.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>&unix; implements two core sandboxes.  One is at the

	  <para>Every &unix; process is completely firewalled off from

	    address space of another.  This is unlike &windows; where a
	    process can easily overwrite the address space of any other,
	    leading to a crash.</para>

	  <para>A &unix; process is owned by a particular userid.  If
	    the user&nbsp;ID is not the <username>root</username> user,
	    it serves to firewall the process off from processes owned
	    by other users.  The user&nbsp;ID is also used to firewall

	<question id="securelevel">
	  <para>What is securelevel?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The securelevel is a security mechanism implemented in
	    the kernel.  Basically, when the securelevel is positive, the
	    kernel restricts certain tasks; not even the superuser
	    (i.e., <username>root</username>) is allowed to do them.  At
	    the time of this writing, the securelevel mechanism is
	    capable of, among other things, limiting the ability
	    to:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Unset certain file flags, such as
		<literal>schg</literal> (the system immutable
		flag).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Write to kernel memory via
		<devicename>/dev/mem</devicename> and
		<devicename>/dev/kmem</devicename>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Load kernel modules.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Alter firewall rules.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>To check the status of the securelevel on a running
	    system, simply execute the following command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl kern.securelevel</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The output will contain the name of the &man.sysctl.8;
	    variable (in this case, <varname>kern.securelevel</varname>)
	    and a number.  The latter is the current value of the
	    securelevel.  If it is positive (i.e., greater than 0), at
	    least some of the securelevel's protections are
	    enabled.</para>

	  <para>You cannot lower the securelevel of a running system;
	    being able to do that would defeat its purpose.  If you need
	    to do a task that requires that the securelevel be
	    non-positive (e.g., an <maketarget>installworld</maketarget>
	    or changing the date), you will have to change the
	    securelevel setting in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	    (you want to look for the
	    <varname>kern_securelevel</varname> and
	    <varname>kern_securelevel_enable</varname> variables) and
	    reboot.</para>

	  <para>For more information on securelevel and the specific
	    things all the levels do, please consult the &man.init.8;
	    manual page.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Securelevel is not a silver bullet; it has many known
	      deficiencies.  More often than not, it provides a false
	      sense of security.</para>

	    <para>One of its biggest problems is that in order for it to
	      be at all effective, all files used in the boot process up

	<answer>
	  <para>BIND uses a random high-numbered port for outgoing
	    queries.  Recent versions of it choose a new, random UDP
	    port for each query.  This may cause problems for some
	    network configurations, especially if a firewall blocks

	<answer>
	  <para>Do not worry.  <username>toor</username> is an
	    <quote>alternative</quote> superuser account (toor is root
	    spelt backwards).  Previously it was created when the
	    &man.bash.1; shell was installed but now it is created by
	    default.  It is intended to be used with a non-standard
	    shell so you do not have to change
	    <username>root</username>'s default shell.  This is
	    important as shells which are not part of the base
	    distribution (for example a shell installed from ports or
	    packages) are likely to be installed in
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename> which, by default,
	    resides on a different file system.  If
	    <username>root</username>'s shell is located in
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename> and
	    <filename class="directory">/usr</filename> (or whatever file system contains
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>) is not mounted for some
	    reason, <username>root</username> will not be able to log in
	    to fix a problem (although if you reboot into single user
	    mode you will be prompted for the path to a shell).</para>

	  <para>Some people use <username>toor</username> for day-to-day
	    <username>root</username> tasks with a non-standard shell,
	    leaving <username>root</username>, with a standard shell,

	  <para>Many people experience hung connections with no apparent
	    explanation.  The first thing to establish is which side of

	  <para>If you are using an external modem, you can simply try
	    using &man.ping.8; to see if the <acronym>TD</acronym> light
	    is flashing when you transmit data.  If it flashes (and the
	    <acronym>RD</acronym> light does not), the problem is with
	    the remote end.  If <acronym>TD</acronym> does not flash,
	    the problem is local.  With an internal modem, you will need
	    to use the <literal>set server</literal> command in your
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file.  When the hang occurs,
	    connect to &man.ppp.8; using &man.pppctl.8;.  If your
	    network connection suddenly revives (PPP was revived due to
	    the activity on the diagnostic socket) or if you cannot
	    connect (assuming the <literal>set socket</literal> command
	    succeeded at startup time), the problem is local.  If you
	    can connect and things are still hung, enable local async
	    logging with <literal>set log local async</literal> and use
	    &man.ping.8; from another window or terminal to make use of
	    the link.  The async logging will show you the data being
	    transmitted and received on the link.  If data is going out
	    and not coming back, the problem is remote.</para>

	  <para>Having established whether the problem is local or
	    remote, you now have two possibilities:</para>

	    You can <literal>enable lqr</literal> in your

	    user-PPP.</para>

	  <para>First, try disabling all local compression by adding the

	  <programlisting>disable pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
deny pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj</programlisting>

	  <para>Then reconnect to ensure that this makes no difference.
	    If things improve or if the problem is solved completely,
	    determine which setting makes the difference through trial
	    and error.  This will provide good ammunition when you
	    contact your ISP (although it may make it apparent that you
	    are not running a &microsoft; product).</para>

	  <para>Before contacting your ISP, enable async logging locally
	    and wait until the connection hangs again.  This may use up
	    quite a bit of disk space.  The last data read from the port

	    describe the problem (<errorname>Memory fault</errorname>,
	    <errorname>Core dumped</errorname>).</para>

	  <para>If your ISP is helpful, they should be able to enable

	  <para>I keep seeing errors about magic being the same.  What

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Occasionally, just after connecting, you may see
	    messages in the log that say <errorname>Magic is
	    same</errorname>.  Sometimes, these messages are harmless,
	    and sometimes one side or the other exits.  Most PPP
	    implementations cannot survive this problem, and even if the
	    link seems to come up, you will see repeated configure
	    requests and configure acknowledgments in the log file until
	    &man.ppp.8; eventually gives up and closes the
	    connection.</para>

	  <para>This normally happens on server machines with slow disks
	    that are spawning a &man.getty.8; on the port, and executing
	    &man.ppp.8; from a login script or program after login.
	    There were reports of it happening consistently when using
	    slirp.  The reason is that in the time taken between
	    &man.getty.8; exiting and &man.ppp.8; starting, the
	    client-side &man.ppp.8; starts sending Line Control Protocol
	    (LCP) packets.  Because ECHO is still switched on for the
	    port on the server, the client &man.ppp.8; sees these
	    packets <quote>reflect</quote> back.</para>

	  <para>One part of the LCP negotiation is to establish a magic
	    number for each side of the link so that
	    <quote>reflections</quote> can be detected.  The protocol
	    says that when the peer tries to negotiate the same magic
	    number, a NAK should be sent and a new magic number should
	    be chosen.  During the period that the server port has ECHO
	    turned on, the client &man.ppp.8; sends LCP packets, sees
	    the same magic in the reflected packet and NAKs it.  It also
	    sees the NAK reflect (which also means &man.ppp.8; must
	    change its magic).  This produces a potentially enormous
	    number of magic number changes, all of which are happily
	    piling into the server's tty buffer.  As soon as &man.ppp.8;
	    starts on the server, it is flooded with magic number
	    changes and almost immediately decides it has tried enough
	    to negotiate LCP and gives up.  Meanwhile, the client, who
	    no longer sees the reflections, becomes happy just in time
	    to see a hangup from the server.</para>

	  <para>This can be avoided by allowing the peer to start
	    negotiating with the following line in your
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to wait for the server to
	    initiate LCP negotiations.  Some servers however may never
	    initiate negotiations.  If this is the case, you can do
	    something like:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode active 3</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to be passive for 3 seconds, and
	    then to start sending LCP requests.  If the peer starts
	    sending requests during this period, &man.ppp.8; will
	    immediately respond rather than waiting for the full 3
	    second period.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>There is currently an implementation mis-feature in
	    &man.ppp.8; where it does not associate LCP, CCP &amp; IPCP
	    responses with their original requests.  As a result, if one
	    PPP implementation is more than 6 seconds slower than the
	    other side, the other side will send two additional LCP
	    configuration requests.  This is fatal.</para>

	  <para>Consider two implementations, <hostid>A</hostid> and
	    <hostid>B</hostid>.  <hostid>A</hostid> starts sending LCP
	    requests immediately after connecting and <hostid>B</hostid>
	    takes 7 seconds to start.  When <hostid>B</hostid> starts,
	    <hostid>A</hostid> has sent 3 LCP REQs.  We are assuming the
	    line has ECHO switched off, otherwise we would see magic
	    number problems as described in the previous section.
	    <hostid>B</hostid> sends a REQ, then an ACK to the first of
	    <hostid>A</hostid>'s REQs.  This results in
	    <hostid>A</hostid> entering the <acronym>OPENED</acronym>
	    state and sending and ACK (the first) back to
	    <hostid>B</hostid>.  In the meantime, <hostid>B</hostid>
	    sends back two more ACKs in response to the two additional
	    REQs sent by <hostid>A</hostid> before <hostid>B</hostid>
	    started up.  <hostid>B</hostid> then receives the first ACK
	    from <hostid>A</hostid> and enters the
	    <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.  <hostid>A</hostid>
	    receives the second ACK from <hostid>B</hostid> and goes
	    back to the <acronym>REQ-SENT</acronym> state, sending
	    another (forth) REQ as per the RFC.  It then receives the
	    third ACK and enters the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.
	    In the meantime, <hostid>B</hostid> receives the forth REQ
	    from <hostid>A</hostid>, resulting in it reverting to the
	    <acronym>ACK-SENT</acronym> state and sending another
	    (second) REQ and (forth) ACK as per the RFC.
	    <hostid>A</hostid> gets the REQ, goes into
	    <acronym>REQ-SENT</acronym> and sends another REQ.  It
	    immediately receives the following ACK and enters
	    <acronym>OPENED</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>This goes on until one side figures out that they are
	    getting nowhere and gives up.</para>

	  <para>The best way to avoid this is to configure one side to
	    be <literal>passive</literal> &mdash; that is, make one side
	    wait for the other to start negotiating.  This can be done
	    with the following command:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

	  <para>Care should be taken with this option.  You should also
	    use this command to limit the amount of time that
	    &man.ppp.8; waits for the peer to begin negotiations:</para>

	  <programlisting>set stopped <replaceable>N</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>Alternatively, the following command (where
	    <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the number of seconds to
	    wait before starting negotiations) can be used:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode active <replaceable>N</replaceable></programlisting>

	<answer>
	  <para>When you execute the <command>shell</command> or

	<answer>
	  <para>There is no way for &man.ppp.8; to automatically

	    is due to the lines that are used in a null-modem serial

	  <para>Why does &man.ppp.8; dial for no reason in
	    <option>-auto</option> mode?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>If &man.ppp.8; is dialing unexpectedly, you must
	    determine the cause, and set up Dial filters (dfilters) to
	    prevent such dialing.</para>

	  <para>To determine the cause, use the following line:</para>

	  <programlisting>set log +tcp/ip</programlisting>

	  <para>This will log all traffic through the connection.  The
	    next time the line comes up unexpectedly, you will see the
	    reason logged with a convenient timestamp next to it.</para>

	  <para>You can now disable dialing under these circumstances.
	    Usually, this sort of problem arises due to DNS lookups.  To
	    prevent DNS lookups from establishing a connection (this
	    will <emphasis>not</emphasis> prevent &man.ppp.8; from
	    passing the packets through an established connection), use
	    the following:</para>

	  <programlisting>set dfilter 1 deny udp src eq 53
set dfilter 2 deny udp dst eq 53
set dfilter 3 permit 0/0 0/0</programlisting>

	  <para>This is not always suitable, as it will effectively
	    break your demand-dial capabilities &mdash; most programs
	    will need a DNS lookup before doing any other network
	    related things.</para>

	  <para>In the DNS case, you should try to determine what is
	    actually trying to resolve a host name.  A lot of the time,
	    &man.sendmail.8; is the culprit.  You should make sure that
	    you tell <application>sendmail</application> not to do any
	    DNS lookups in its configuration file.  See the section on
	    <ulink
	      url="&url.books.handbook;/smtp-dialup.html">using email with a dialup connection</ulink>
	    in the &os; Handbook for details on how to create your own

	    want to add the following line to your
	    <filename>.mc</filename> file:</para>

	  <programlisting>define(`confDELIVERY_MODE', `d')dnl</programlisting>

	  <para>This will make <application>sendmail</application> queue
	    everything until the queue is run (usually, sendmail is
	    invoked with <option>-bd -q30m</option>, telling it to run

	  <para>The <application>ppp</application> utility parses each

	  <para>When the chat interpreter parses each argument, it

	    file?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The <application>ppp</application> utility (or any other
	    program for that matter) should never dump core.  Because
	    &man.ppp.8; runs with an effective user&nbsp;ID of
	    <literal>0</literal>, the operating system will not write
	    core image of &man.ppp.8; to disk before terminating it.
	    If, however &man.ppp.8; is actually terminating due to a
	    segmentation violation or some other signal that normally
	    causes core to be dumped, <emphasis>and</emphasis> you are
	    sure you are using the latest version (see the start of this
	    section), then you should install the system sources and do
	    the following:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root;  <userinput><command>cd</command> <filename class="directory">/usr/src/usr.sbin/ppp</filename></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><command>echo</command> <makevar>STRIP</makevar>= &gt;&gt; <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><command>echo</command> <makevar>CFLAGS</makevar>+=<option>-g</option> &gt;&gt; <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput><command>make</command> <maketarget>install</maketarget> <maketarget>clean</maketarget></userinput></screen>

	  <para>You will now have a debuggable version of &man.ppp.8;
	    installed.  You will have to be <username>root</username> to
	    run &man.ppp.8; as all of its privileges have been revoked.
	    When you start &man.ppp.8;, take a careful note of what your
	    current directory was at the time.</para>

	  <para>Now, if and when &man.ppp.8; receives the segmentation
	    violation, it will dump a core file called
	    <filename>ppp.core</filename>.  You should then do the
	    following:</para>

	<question id="ppp-autodialprocess-noconnect">
	  <para>Why does the process that forces a dial in
	    <option>-auto</option> mode never connect?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This was a known problem with &man.ppp.8; set up to
	    negotiate a dynamic local IP number with the peer in
	    <option>-auto</option> mode.  It has been fixed a long time
	    ago &mdash; search the manual page for
	    <literal>iface</literal>.</para>

	  <para>The problem was that when that initial program calls
	    &man.connect.2;, the IP number of the &man.tun.4; interface
	    is assigned to the socket endpoint.  The kernel creates the
	    first outgoing packet and writes it to the &man.tun.4;
	    device.  &man.ppp.8; then reads the packet and establishes a
	    connection.  If, as a result of &man.ppp.8;'s dynamic IP
	    assignment, the interface address is changed, the original
	    socket endpoint will be invalid.  Any subsequent packets
	    sent to the peer will usually be dropped.  Even if they are
	    not, any responses will not route back to the originating
	    machine as the IP number is no longer owned by that
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>There are several theoretical ways to approach this
	    problem.  It would be nicest if the peer would re-assign the
	    same IP number if possible.  The current version of
	    &man.ppp.8; does this, but most other implementations do
	    not.</para>

	  <para>The easiest method from our side would be to never
	    change the &man.tun.4; interface IP number, but instead to
	    change all outgoing packets so that the source IP number is
	    changed from the interface IP to the negotiated IP on the
	    fly.  This is essentially what the
	    <literal>iface-alias</literal> option in the latest version
	    of &man.ppp.8; is doing (with the help of &man.libalias.3;
	    and &man.ppp.8;'s <option>-nat</option> switch) &mdash; it
	    is maintaining all previous interface addresses and NATing
	    them to the last negotiated address.</para>

	  <para>Another alternative (and probably the most reliable)
	    would be to implement a system call that changes all bound
	    sockets from one IP to another.  &man.ppp.8; would use this
	    call to modify the sockets of all existing programs when a
	    new IP number is negotiated.  The same system call could be
	    used by <acronym>DHCP</acronym> clients when they are forced
	    to call the <function>bind()</function> function for their
	    sockets.</para>

	  <para>Yet another possibility is to allow an interface to be
	    brought up without an IP number.  Outgoing packets would be
	    given an IP number of <hostid
	      role="ipaddr">255.255.255.255</hostid> up until the first
	    <literal>SIOCAIFADDR</literal> &man.ioctl.2; is done.  This
	    would result in fully binding the socket.  It would be up to
	    &man.ppp.8; to change the source IP number, but only if it
	    is set to <hostid role="ipaddr">255.255.255.255</hostid>,
	    and only the IP number and IP checksum would need to change.
	    This, however is a bit of a hack as the kernel would be
	    sending bad packets to an improperly configured interface,
	    on the assumption that some other mechanism is capable of
	    fixing things retrospectively.</para>

	<question id="ppp-nat-games">
	  <para>Why do most games not work with the
	    <option>-nat</option> switch?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The reason games and the like do not work when
	    &man.libalias.3; is in use is that the machine on the outside
	    will try to open a connection or send (unsolicited) UDP
	    packets to the machine on the inside.  The NAT software does
	    not know that it should send these packets to the interior
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>To make things work, make sure that the only thing
	    running is the software that you are having problems with,
	    then either run &man.tcpdump.1; on the &man.tun.4; interface
	    of the gateway or enable &man.ppp.8; TCP/IP logging
	    (<literal>set log +tcp/ip</literal>) on the gateway.</para>

	  <para>When you start the offending software, you should see
	    packets passing through the gateway machine.  When something
	    comes back from the outside, it will be dropped (that is the
	    problem).  Note the port number of these packets then shut
	    down the offending software.  Do this a few times to see if
	    the port numbers are consistent.  If they are, then the
	    following line in the relevant section of
	    <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename> will make the
	    software functional:</para>

	  <programlisting>nat port <replaceable>proto</replaceable> <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable> <replaceable>port</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>where <replaceable>proto</replaceable> is either
	    <literal>tcp</literal> or <literal>udp</literal>,
	    <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable> is the machine
	    that you want the packets to be sent to and
	    <replaceable>port</replaceable> is the destination port
	    number of the packets.</para>

	  <para>You will not be able to use the software on other
	    machines without changing the above command, and running the
	    software on two internal machines at the same time is out of
	    the question &mdash; after all, the outside world is seeing
	    your entire internal network as being just a single
	    machine.</para>

		the outside machine to initiate a connection back to the

	<question id="fcs-errors">
	  <para>What are FCS errors?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>FCS stands for <literal>F</literal>rame
	    <literal>C</literal>heck <literal>S</literal>equence.  Each
	    PPP packet has a checksum attached to ensure that the data
	    being received is the data being sent.  If the FCS of an
	    incoming packet is incorrect, the packet is dropped and the
	    HDLC FCS count is increased.  The HDLC error values can be
	    displayed using the <literal>show hdlc</literal>
	    command.</para>

	  <para>If your link is bad (or if your serial driver is
	    dropping packets), you will see the occasional FCS error.
	    This is not usually worth worrying about although it does
	    slow down the compression protocols substantially.  If you
	    have an external modem, make sure your cable is properly
	    shielded from interference &mdash; this may eradicate the
	    problem.</para>

	  <para>If your link freezes as soon as you have connected and
	    you see a large number of FCS errors, this may be because your
	    link is not 8-bit clean.  Make sure your modem is not using
	    software flow control (XON/XOFF).  If your datalink
	    <emphasis>must</emphasis> use software flow control, use the
	    command <literal>set accmap 0x000a0000</literal> to tell
	    &man.ppp.8; to escape the <literal>^Q</literal> and
	    <literal>^S</literal> characters.</para>

	  <para>Another reason for seeing too many FCS errors may be
	    that the remote end has stopped talking
	    <acronym>PPP</acronym>.  You may want to enable
	    <literal>async</literal> logging at this point to determine
	    if the incoming data is actually a login or shell prompt.
	    If you have a shell prompt at the remote end, it is possible
	    to terminate &man.ppp.8; without dropping the line by using
	    the <command>close lcp</command> command (a following
	    <command>term</command> command) will reconnect you to the
	    shell on the remote machine.</para>

	  <para>If nothing in your log file indicates why the link might
	    have been terminated, you should ask the remote
	    administrator (your ISP?) why the session was
	    terminated.</para>

	<question id="macos-win98-pppoe-freeze">
	  <para>Why do &macos; and &windows;&nbsp;98 connections freeze
	    when running PPPoE on the gateway?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Thanks to Michael Wozniak
	    <email>mwozniak@netcom.ca</email> for figuring this out and
	    Dan Flemming <email>danflemming@mac.com</email> for the Mac
	    solution:</para>

	  <para>This is due to what is called a <quote>Black
	    Hole</quote> router.  &macos; and &windows;&nbsp;98 (and maybe
	    other &microsoft; OSs) send TCP packets with a requested
	    segment size too big to fit into a PPPoE frame (MTU is
	    <literal>1500</literal> by default for Ethernet)
	    <emphasis>and</emphasis> have the <quote>do not
	    fragment</quote> bit set (default of TCP) and the Telco
	    router is not sending ICMP <quote>must fragment</quote> back
	    to the WWW site you are trying to load.  (Alternatively, the
	    router is sending the ICMP packet correctly, but the
	    firewall at the WWW site is dropping it.) When the www
	    server is sending you frames that do not fit into the PPPoE
	    pipe the Telco router drops them on the floor and your page
	    does not load (some pages/graphics do as they are smaller
	    than a MSS).  This seems to be the default of most Telco
	    PPPoE configurations.</para>

	  <para>One fix is to use <application>regedit</application> on
	    your 95/98 system to add the following registry entry:</para>

	  <programlisting>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans\0000\MaxMTU</programlisting>

	  <para>It should be a string with a value
	    <literal>1436</literal>, as some ADSL routers are reported
	    to be unable to deal with packets larger than this.  This
	    registry key has been changed to
	    <literal>Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\<replaceable>ID for
	    adapter</replaceable>\MTU</literal> in &windows;&nbsp;2000
	    and becomes a <literal>DWORD</literal>.</para>

	  <para>Refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base documents <ulink
	      url="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q158/4/74.asp">Q158474 - Windows TCPIP Registry Entries</ulink>

	      url="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q120/6/42.asp">Q120642 - TCPIP & NBT Configuration Parameters for &windowsnt;</ulink>

	    <literal>DWORD</literal> to <literal>1</literal> as
	    mentioned in the Microsoft document 120642 mentioned
	    above.</para>

	  <para>Unfortunately, &macos; does not provide an interface for
	    changing TCP/IP settings.  However, there are several commercial
	    programs available that will allow users to customize TCP/IP
	    settings.  &macos; NAT users should search for their MTU
	    settings and enter <literal>1450</literal> instead of
	    <literal>1500</literal>.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ppp.8; has an <command>enable

	<question id="found-serial">
	  <para>How do I tell if &os; found my serial ports?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>As the &os; kernel boots, it will probe for the serial
	    ports in your system for which the kernel was configured.
	    You can either watch your system closely for the messages it
	    prints or run this command after your system is up and
	    running:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>dmesg | grep -E "^sio[0-9]"</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Here is some example output from the above
	    command:</para>

	  <programlisting>sio0: <16550A-compatible COM port> port 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 flags 0x10 on acpi0
sio0: type 16550A
sio1: <16550A-compatible COM port> port 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on acpi0
sio1: type 16550A</programlisting>

	  <para>This shows two serial ports.  The first is on
	    IRQ&nbsp;4, is using port address <literal>0x3f8</literal>,
	    and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The second uses the same
	    kind of chip but is on IRQ&nbsp;3 and is at port address
	    <literal>0x2f8</literal>.  Internal modem cards are treated
	    just like serial ports &mdash; except that they always have
	    a modem <quote>attached</quote> to the port.</para>

	  <para>The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel includes support
	    for two serial ports using the same IRQ and port address
	    settings in the above example.  If these settings are not
	    right for your system, or if you have added modem cards or
	    have more serial ports than your kernel is configured for,
	    just reconfigure your kernel.  See section <link
	      linkend="make-kernel">about building a kernel</link> for

	<question id="access-serial-ports">
	  <para>How do I access the serial ports on &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The third serial port, <devicename>sio2</devicename>
	    (see &man.sio.4;, known as <devicename>COM3</devicename> in
	    DOS), is on <devicename>/dev/cuad2</devicename> for dial-out
	    devices, and on <devicename>/dev/ttyd2</devicename> for
	    dial-in devices.  What is the difference between these two
	    classes of devices?</para>

	  <para>You use
	    <devicename>ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    for dial-ins.  When opening
	    <devicename>/dev/ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    in blocking mode, a process will wait for the corresponding
	    <devicename>cuad<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    device to become inactive, and then wait for the carrier
	    detect line to go active.  When you open the
	    <devicename>cuad<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    device, it makes sure the serial port is not already in use
	    by the
	    <devicename>ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    device.  If the port is available, it <quote>steals</quote>
	    it from the
	    <devicename>ttyd<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    device.  Also, the
	    <devicename>cuad<replaceable>X</replaceable></devicename>
	    device does not care about carrier detect.  With this scheme
	    and an auto-answer modem, you can have remote users log in
	    and you can still dial out with the same modem and the
	    system will take care of all the conflicts.</para>

	<question id="enable-multiport-serial">
	  <para>How do I enable support for a multiport serial
	    card?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Again, the section on kernel configuration provides
	    information about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport
	    serial card, place an &man.sio.4; line for each serial port
	    on the card in the &man.device.hints.5; file.  But place the
	    IRQ specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports
	    on the card should share one IRQ.  For consistency, use the
	    last serial port to specify the IRQ.  Also, specify the
	    following option in the kernel configuration file:</para>

	  <programlisting>options COM_MULTIPORT</programlisting>

	  <para>The following <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>
	    example is for an AST 4-port serial card on
	    IRQ&nbsp;12:</para>

	  <programlisting>hint.sio.4.at="isa"
hint.sio.4.port="0x2a0"
hint.sio.4.flags="0x701"
hint.sio.5.at="isa"

hint.sio.7.at="isa"
hint.sio.7.port="0x2b8"
hint.sio.7.flags="0x701"
hint.sio.7.irq="12"</programlisting>

	  <para>The flags indicate that the master port has minor number
	    <literal>7</literal> (<literal>0x700</literal>), and all the

	<question id="more-swap">
	  <para>&os; uses far more swap space than &linux;.  Why?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>&os; only appears to use more swap than &linux;.  In
	    actual fact, it does not.  The main difference between &os;
	    and &linux; in this regard is that &os; will proactively
	    move entirely idle, unused pages of main memory into swap in
	    order to make more main memory available for active use.
	    &linux; tends to only move pages to swap as a last resort.
	    The perceived heavier use of swap is balanced by the more
	    efficient use of main memory.</para>

	  <para>Note that while &os; is proactive in this regard, it
	    does not arbitrarily decide to swap pages when the system is
	    truly idle.  Thus you will not find your system all paged
	    out when you get up in the morning after leaving it idle
	    overnight.</para>

	  <para>Why does <command>top</command> show very little free

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The simple answer is that free memory is wasted memory.
	    Any memory that your programs do not actively allocate is
	    used within the &os; kernel as disk cache.  The values shown
	    by &man.top.1; labeled as <literal>Inact</literal>,
	    <literal>Cache</literal>, and <literal>Buf</literal> are all
	    cached data at different aging levels.  This cached data
	    means the system does not have to access a slow disk again
	    for data it has accessed recently, thus increasing overall
	    performance.  In general, a low value shown for
	    <literal>Free</literal> memory in &man.top.1; is good,
	    provided it is not <emphasis>very</emphasis> low.</para>

	<question id="chmod-symlinks">
	  <para>Why will <command>chmod</command> not change the
	    permissions on symlinks?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Symlinks do not have permissions, and by default,
	    &man.chmod.1; will follow symlinks to change the
	    permissions on the source file, if possible.  So if you have a file,
	    <filename>foo</filename>, and a symlink to that file,
	    <filename>bar</filename>, then this command will always
	    succeed.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod g-w bar</userinput></screen>

	  <para>However, the permissions on <filename>bar</filename>
	    will not have changed.</para>

	  <para>When changing modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the
	    files instead of the files themselves,
	    you have to use either <option>-H</option> or
	    <option>-L</option> together with the <option>-R</option>
	    option to make this work.  See the &man.chmod.1; and
	    &man.symlink.7; manual pages for more info.</para>

	  <para>Why should I care what color the bikeshed is?</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>The really, really short answer is that you should not.
	    The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are
	    capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop
	    others from building one just because you do not like the
	    color they plan to paint it.  This is a metaphor indicating
	    that you need not argue about every little feature just
	    because you know enough to do so.  Some people have
	    commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is
	    inversely proportional to the complexity of the
	    change.</para>

	  <para>The longer and more complete answer is that after a very
	    long argument about whether &man.sleep.1; should take
	    fractional second arguments, &a.phk; posted a long message
	    entitled <quote><ulink
	      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=506636+517178+/usr/local/www/db/text/1999/freebsd-hackers/19991003.freebsd-hackers">A bike shed (any color will do) on greener grass...</ulink></quote>.
	    The appropriate portions of that message are quoted
	    below.</para>

	    <attribution>&a.phk; on &a.hackers.name;, October 2,

	    <para><quote>What is it about this bike shed?</quote>  Some
	      of you have asked me.</para>

	    <para>It is a long story, or rather it is an old story, but
	      it is quite short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote
	      a book in the early 1960s, called <quote>Parkinson's
	      Law</quote>, which contains a lot of insight into the
	      dynamics of management.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>[snip a bit of commentary on the
	      book]</emphasis></para>

	    <para>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the
	      other vital component is an atomic power-plant, I guess
	      that illustrates the age of the book.</para>

	    <para>Parkinson shows how you can go into the board of
	      directors and get approval for building a multi-million or
	      even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to
	      build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless
	      discussions.</para>

	    <para>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic
	      plant is so vast, so expensive and so complicated that
	      people cannot grasp it, and rather than try, they fall
	      back on the assumption that somebody else checked all the
	      details before it got this far.  Richard P. Feynmann
	      gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,
	      examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.</para>

	    <para>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one
	      of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch the
	      game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no matter how

	      the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is

	      <emphasis>here</emphasis>.</para>

	    <para>In Denmark we call it <quote>setting your

	      that.</quote> It is a strong trait in politicians, but

	  <para>How cool is &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Q.  Has anyone done any temperature testing while
	    running &os;?  I know &linux; runs cooler than DOS, but have
	    never seen a mention of &os;.  It seems to run really
	    hot.</para>

	  <para>A.  No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
	    blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
	    LSD-25 administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers said
	    that &os; tasted sort of orange, whereas &linux; tasted like
	    purple haze.  Neither group mentioned any significant
	    variances in temperature.  We eventually had to throw the
	    results of this survey out entirely anyway when we found
	    that too many volunteers were wandering out of the room
	    during the tests, thus skewing the results.  We think most
	    of the volunteers are at Apple now, working on their new
	    <quote>scratch and sniff</quote> GUI.  It is a funny old
	    business we are in!</para>

	  <para>Seriously, both &os; and &linux; use the
	    <acronym>HLT</acronym> (halt) instruction when the system is
	    idle thus lowering its energy consumption and therefore the
	    heat it generates.  Also if you have APM (advanced power

	<answer>
	  <para>Q.  Is there anything <quote>odd</quote> that &os; does
	    when compiling the kernel which would cause the memory to

	    moment after recognizing the floppy drive upon startup, as
	    well), a strange scratchy sound emanates from what appears
	    to be the memory banks.</para>

	  <para>A.  Yes!  You will see frequent references to
	    <quote>daemons</quote> in the BSD documentation, and what
	    most people do not know is that this refers to genuine,
	    non-corporeal entities that now possess your computer.  The
	    scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
	    high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as they
	    best decide how to deal with various system administration
	    tasks.</para>

	  <para>If the noise gets to you, a good
	    <command>fdisk /mbr</command> from DOS will get rid of them,
	    but do not be surprised if they react adversely and try to
	    stop you.  In fact, if at any point during the exercise you
	    hear the satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the

	    back!  Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD
	    daemons, the twin demons of DOS and &windows; are often able
	    to re-assert total control over your machine to the eternal

	<question id="dev-null">
	  <para>Where does data written to
	    <filename>/dev/null</filename> go?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>It goes into a special data sink in the CPU where it is
	    converted to heat which is vented through the heatsink / fan
	    assembly.  This is why CPU cooling is increasingly
	    important; as people get used to faster processors, they
	    become careless with their data and more and more of it ends
	    up in <filename>/dev/null</filename>, overheating their
	    CPUs.  If you delete <filename>/dev/null</filename> (which
	    effectively disables the CPU data sink) your CPU may run
	    cooler but your system will quickly become constipated with
	    all that excess data and start to behave erratically.  If
	    you have a fast network connection you can cool down your
	    CPU by reading data out of <filename>/dev/random</filename>
	    and sending it off somewhere; however you run the risk of
	    overheating your network connection and
	    <filename class="directory">/</filename> or angering your ISP, as most of the
	    data will end up getting converted to heat by their
	    equipment, but they generally have good cooling, so if you
	    do not overdo it you should be OK.</para>

	  <para><emphasis>Paul Robinson adds:</emphasis></para>

	  <para>There are other methods.  As every good sysadmin knows,
	    it is part of standard practice to send data to the screen
	    of interesting variety to keep all the pixies that make up
	    your picture happy.  Screen pixies (commonly mis-typed or
	    re-named as <quote>pixels</quote>) are categorized by the
	    type of hat they wear (red, green or blue) and will hide or
	    appear (thereby showing the color of their hat) whenever
	    they receive a little piece of food.  Video cards turn data
	    into pixie-food, and then send them to the pixies &mdash;
	    the more expensive the card, the better the food, so the
	    better behaved the pixies are.  They also need constant
	    stimulation &mdash; this is why screen savers exist.</para>

	  <para>To take your suggestions further, you could just throw
	    the random data to console, thereby letting the pixies
	    consume it.  This causes no heat to be produced at all,
	    keeps the pixies happy and gets rid of your data quite
	    quickly, even if it does make things look a bit messy on
	    your screen.</para>

	  <para>Incidentally, as an ex-admin of a large ISP who
	    experienced many problems attempting to maintain a stable
	    temperature in a server room, I would strongly discourage
	    people sending the data they do not want out to the network.
	    The fairies who do the packet switching and routing get
	    annoyed by it as well.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>By: Frank Durda IV
	    <email>uhclem@nemesis.lonestar.org</email></para>

	  <para>In a nutshell, there a few I/O ports that all of the PnP
	    boards respond to when the host asks if anyone is out there.
	    So when the PnP probe routine starts, it asks if there are
	    any PnP boards present, and all the PnP boards respond with
	    their model # to a I/O read of the same port, so the probe
	    routine gets a wired-OR <quote>yes</quote> to that question.
	    At least one bit will be on in that reply.  Then the probe
	    code is able to cause boards with board model IDs (assigned
	    by &microsoft;/&intel;) lower than <literal>X</literal> to
	    go <quote>off-line</quote>.  It then looks to see if any
	    boards are still responding to the query.  If the answer was
	    <literal>0</literal>, then there are no boards with IDs
	    above <literal>X</literal>.  Probe will then ask for boards
	    below <literal>X</literal>.  Finally, probe requests boards
	    greater than
	    <literal>X&nbsp;-&nbsp;(limit&nbsp;/&nbsp;4)</literal> to go
	    off-line.  It then repeats this query.  By repeating this
	    semi-binary search of IDs-in-range enough times, the probing
	    code will eventually identify all PnP boards present in a
	    given machine with a number of iterations that is much lower
	    than what 2<superscript>64</superscript> would take.</para>

	  <para>The IDs are two 32-bit fields (hence
	    2<superscript>64</superscript>) + 8-bit checksum.  The first
	    32&nbsp;bits are a vendor identifier.  They never come out
	    and say it, but it appears to be assumed that different
	    types of boards from the same vendor could have different
	    32-bit vendor IDs.  The idea of needing 32&nbsp;bits just
	    for unique manufacturers is a bit excessive.</para>

	  <para>The lower 32&nbsp;bits are a serial #, or something else
	    that makes this one board unique.  The vendor must never
	    produce a second board that has the same lower 32&nbsp;bits
	    unless the upper 32&nbsp;bits are also different.  So you
	    can have multiple boards of the same type in the machine and
	    the full 64&nbsp;bits will still be unique.</para>

	  <para>The 32-bit groups can never be all zero.  This
	    allows the wired-OR to show non-zero bits during the initial
	    binary search.</para>

	  <para>Once the system has identified all the board IDs
	    present, it will reactivate each board, one at a time (via the
	    same I/O ports), and find out what resources the given board
	    needs, what interrupt choices are available, etc.  A scan is
	    made over all the boards to collect this information.</para>

	  <para>This info is then combined with info from any ECU files
	    on the hard disk or wired into the MLB BIOS.  The ECU and
	    BIOS PnP support for hardware on the MLB is usually
	    synthetic, and the peripherals do not really do genuine PnP.
	    However by examining the BIOS info plus the ECU info, the
	    probe routines can cause the devices that are PnP to avoid
	    those devices the probe code cannot relocate.</para>

	  <para>Then the PnP devices are visited once more and given
	    their I/O, DMA, IRQ and Memory-map address assignments.  The
	    devices will then appear at those locations and remain there
	    until the next reboot, although there is nothing that says
	    you cannot move them around whenever you want.</para>

	  <para>There is a lot of oversimplification above, but you
	    should get the general idea.</para>

	  <para>&microsoft; took over some of the primary printer status
	    ports to do PnP, on the logic that no boards decoded those
	    addresses for the opposing I/O cycles.  I found a genuine
	    IBM printer board that did decode writes of the status port
	    during the early PnP proposal review period, but &microsoft;
	    said <quote>tough</quote>.  So they do a write to the
	    printer status port for setting addresses, plus that use
	    that address + <literal>0x800</literal>, and a third I/O
	    port for reading that can be located anywhere between
	    <literal>0x200</literal> and <literal>0x3ff</literal>.

	<question id="alternate-directory-layout">
	  <para>What about alternative layout policies for
	    directories?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>In answer to the question of alternative layout policies
	    for directories, the scheme that is currently in use is
	    unchanged from what I wrote in 1983.  I wrote that policy
	    for the original fast file system, and never revisited it.
	    It works well at keeping cylinder groups from filling up.
	    As several of you have noted, it works poorly for find.
	    Most file systems are created from archives that were
	    created by a depth first search (aka ftw).  These
	    directories end up being striped across the cylinder groups
	    thus creating a worst possible scenario for future depth
	    first searches.  If one knew the total number of directories
	    to be created, the solution would be to create
	    <literal>(total&nbsp;/&nbsp;fs_ncg)</literal> per cylinder
	    group before moving on.  Obviously, one would have to create
	    some heuristic to guess at this number.  Even using a small
	    fixed number like say 10 would make an order of magnitude
	    improvement.  To differentiate restores from normal
	    operation (when the current algorithm is probably more
	    sensible), you could use the clustering of up to 10 if they
	    were all done within a ten second window.  Anyway, my
	    conclusion is that this is an area ripe for
	    experimentation.</para>

	<question id="kernel-panic-troubleshooting">
	  <para>How can I make the most of the data I see when my kernel
	    panics?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Here is typical kernel panic:</para>

	  <programlisting>Fatal trap 12: page fault while in kernel mode
fault virtual address   = 0x40
fault code              = supervisor read, page not present
instruction pointer     = 0x8:0xf014a7e5
stack pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f24
frame pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f28
code segment            = base 0x0, limit 0xfffff, type 0x1b
                        = DPL 0, pres 1, def32 1, gran 1
processor eflags        = interrupt enabled, resume, IOPL = 0
current process         = 80 (mount)
interrupt mask          =
trap number             = 12
panic: page fault</programlisting>

	  <para>When you see a message like this, it is not enough to
	    just reproduce it and send it in.  The instruction pointer
	    value is important;
	    unfortunately, it is also configuration dependent.  In other
	    words, the value varies depending on the exact kernel image
	    that you are using.  If you are using a
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel image from one of the
	    snapshots, then it is possible for somebody else to track
	    down the offending function, but if you are running a custom
	    kernel then only <emphasis>you</emphasis> can tell us where
	    the fault occurred.</para>

	  <para>What you should do is this:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Write down the instruction pointer value.  Note
		that the <literal>0x8:</literal> part at the beginning
		is not significant in this case: it is the
		<literal>0xf0xxxxxx</literal> part that we
		want.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>When the system reboots, do the following:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput><command>nm</command> <option>-n</option> <replaceable>kernel.that.caused.the.panic</replaceable> | <command>grep</command> f0xxxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>where <literal>f0xxxxxx</literal> is the
		instruction pointer value.  The odds are you will not
		get an exact match since the symbols in the kernel
		symbol table are for the entry points of functions and
		the instruction pointer address will be somewhere
		inside a function, not at the start.  If you do not
		get an exact match, omit the last digit from the
		instruction pointer value and try again, i.e.:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput><command>nm</command> <option>-n</option> <replaceable>kernel.that.caused.the.panic</replaceable> | <command>grep</command> f0xxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>If that does not yield any results, chop off another
		digit.  Repeat until you get some sort of output.  The
		result will be a possible list of functions which caused
		the panic.  This is a less than exact mechanism for
		tracking down the point of failure, but it is better
		than nothing.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>However, the best way to track down the cause of a panic
	    is by capturing a crash dump, then using &man.kgdb.1; to
	    generate a stack trace on the crash dump.</para>

	  <para>In any case, the method is this:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Make sure that the following line is included in
		your kernel configuration file
		(<filename>/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></filename>):</para>

	      <programlisting>makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Change to the <filename
		  class="directory">/usr/src</filename>
		directory:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><command>cd</command> <filename class="directory">/usr/src</filename></userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Compile the kernel:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><command>make</command> <maketarget>buildkernel</maketarget> <makevar>KERNCONF</makevar>=<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Wait for &man.make.1; to finish compiling.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><command>make</command> <maketarget>installkernel</maketarget> <makevar>KERNCONF</makevar>=<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Reboot.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you do not use the <makevar>KERNCONF</makevar>
	      make variable a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel will
	      be built and installed.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The &man.make.1; process will have built two kernels.
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable>/kernel</filename>
	    and
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable>/kernel.debug</filename>.
	    <filename>kernel</filename> was installed as
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename>, while
	    <filename>kernel.debug</filename> can be used as the source
	    of debugging symbols for &man.kgdb.1;.</para>

	  <para>To make sure you capture a crash dump, you need edit
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and set
	    <literal>dumpdev</literal> to point to your swap partition
	    (or <literal>AUTO</literal>).  This will cause the
	    &man.rc.8; scripts to use the &man.dumpon.8; command to
	    enable crash dumps.  You can also run &man.dumpon.8;
	    manually.  After a panic, the crash dump can be recovered
	    using &man.savecore.8;; if <literal>dumpdev</literal> is set
	    in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the &man.rc.8; scripts
	    will run &man.savecore.8; automatically and put the crash
	    dump in <filename class="directory">/var/crash</filename>.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>&os; crash dumps are usually the same size as the
	      physical RAM size of your machine.  That is, if you have
	      512&nbsp;MB of RAM, you will get a 512&nbsp;MB crash dump.
	      Therefore you must make sure there is enough space in
	      <filename class="directory">/var/crash</filename> to hold the dump.
	      Alternatively, you run &man.savecore.8; manually and have
	      it recover the crash dump to another directory where you
	      have more room.  It is possible to limit the size of the
	      crash dump by using <literal>options
	      MAXMEM=<replaceable>N</replaceable></literal> where
	      <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the size of kernel's
	      memory usage in KBs.  For example, if you have 1&nbsp;GB
	      of RAM, you can limit the kernel's memory usage to
	      128&nbsp;MB by this way, so that your crash dump size will
	      be 128&nbsp;MB instead of 1&nbsp;GB.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>Once you have recovered the crash dump, you can get a
	    stack trace with &man.kgdb.1; as follows:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput><command>kgdb</command> <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable>/kernel.debug</filename> <filename class="directory">/var/crash/<replaceable>vmcore.0</replaceable></filename></userinput>
<prompt>(kgdb)</prompt> <userinput>backtrace</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Note that there may be several screens worth of
	    information; ideally you should use &man.script.1; to
	    capture all of them.  Using the unstripped kernel image with
	    all the debug symbols should show the exact line of kernel
	    source code where the panic occurred.  Usually you have to
	    read the stack trace from the bottom up in order to trace
	    the exact sequence of events that lead to the crash.  You
	    can also use &man.kgdb.1; to print out the contents of
	    various variables or structures in order to examine the
	    system state at the time of the crash.</para>

	  <tip>
	    <para>Now, if you are really insane and have a second
	      computer, you can also configure &man.kgdb.1; to do remote
	      debugging such that you can use &man.kgdb.1; on one system
	      to debug the kernel on another system, including setting
	      breakpoints, single-stepping through the kernel code, just
	      like you can do with a normal user-mode program.</para>
	  </tip>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you have <literal>DDB</literal> enabled and the
	      kernel drops into the debugger, you can force a panic (and
	      a crash dump) just by typing <literal>panic</literal> at
	      the <literal>ddb</literal> prompt.  It may stop in the
	      debugger again during the panic phase.  If it does, type
	      <literal>continue</literal> and it will finish the crash
	      dump.</para>

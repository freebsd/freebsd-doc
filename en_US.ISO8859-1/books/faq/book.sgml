<para>Welcome to the FreeBSD 2.X-3.X FAQ!</para>
  
<para>As is usual with Usenet FAQs, this document aims to cover the most
frequently asked questions concerning the FreeBSD operating system
(and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended to reduce
bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked over and over
again, FAQs have become recognized as valuable information resources.</para>
  
<para>Every effort has been made to make this FAQ as informative as
possible; if you have any suggestions as to how it may be improved,
please feel free to mail them to the <ulink URL="mailto:FAQ@FreeBSD.org">FAQ maintainer</ulink>.</para>
  
<qandaset><qandaentry><question>
<para>What is FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>Briefly, FreeBSD 2.X is a UN*X-like operating system based on
U.C. Berkeley's 4.4BSD-lite release for the i386 platform.  It is
also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
Net/2 to the i386, known as 386BSD, though very little of the 386BSD
code remains.  A fuller description of what FreeBSD is and how
it can work for you may be found on the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD home page</ulink>.</para>
  
<para>FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers,
computer professionals, students and home users all over the world
in their work, education and recreation.  See some of them in the
<ulink URL="../gallery/gallery.html">FreeBSD Gallery.</ulink></para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>What are the goals of FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may
be used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of us
have a significant investment in the code (and project) and would
certainly not mind a little financial compensation now and then,
but we're definitely not prepared to insist on it.  We believe
that our first and foremost "mission" is to provide code to any
and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
This is, we believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
Software and one that we enthusiastically support.</para>
  
<para>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU General 
Public License (GPL) or GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) 
comes with slightly more strings attached, though at least on the 
side of enforced access rather than the usual opposite.  Due to the 
additional complexities that can evolve in the commercial use of 
GPL software, we do, however, endeavor to replace such software 
with submissions under the more relaxed BSD copyright whenever 
possible.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Why is it called FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>It may be used free of charge, even by commercial users.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Full source for the operating system is freely available, and
the minimum possible restrictions have been placed upon its
use, distribution and incorporation into other work (commercial
or non-commercial).
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Anyone who has an improvement and/or bug fix is free to submit
their code and have it added to the source tree (subject to
one or two obvious provisos).</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
  
<para>For those of our readers whose first language is not English, it
may be worth pointing out that the word ``free'' is being used in two
ways here, one meaning ``at no cost'', the other meaning ``you can do
whatever you like''.  Apart from one or two things you <emphasis remap=tt>cannot</emphasis>
do with the FreeBSD code, for example pretending you wrote it, you
really can do whatever you like with it.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>What is the latest version of FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>Version <ulink URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/3.4-RELEASE/">3.4</ulink> is the latest <emphasis>stable</emphasis> version; it was released
in December, 1999. This is also the latest <emphasis>release</emphasis> version.</para>
  
<para>Briefly explained, <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> is aimed at the ISP or other
corporate user who wants stability and a low change count over
the wizzy new features of the latest <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot.
Releases can come from either "branch," but you should only use
<emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> if you're sure that you're prepared for its
increased volatility (relative to <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>, that is).</para>
  
<para>Releases are only made <link linkend="release-freq">every few months</link>. While many people stay more up-to-date with the
FreeBSD sources (see the questions on <link linkend="current">FreeBSD-CURRENT</link> and <link linkend="stable">FreeBSD-STABLE</link>) than that, doing so is more of a
commitment, as the sources are a moving target.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question
id="current">
<para>What is FreeBSD-CURRENT?</para></question><answer>

<para><ulink URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">FreeBSD-CURRENT</ulink> is the
development version of the operating system, which will in due
course become 4.0-RELEASE.  As such, it is really only of interest
to developers working on the system and die-hard hobbyists.
See the <ulink URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">relevant section</ulink>
in the <ulink URL="../handbook/index.html">handbook</ulink> for
details on running -CURRENT.</para>
  
<para>If you are not familiar with the operating system or are not
capable of identifying the difference between a real problem and
a temporary problem, you should not use FreeBSD-CURRENT.  This
branch sometimes evolves quite quickly and can be un-buildable
for a number of days at a time.  People that use FreeBSD-CURRENT
are expected to be able to analyze any problems and only report them
if they are deemed to be mistakes rather than ``glitches''.  Questions
such as ``make world produces some error about groups'' on the
-CURRENT mailing list are sometimes treated with contempt.</para>
  
<para>Every now and again, a <ulink URL="../releases/snapshots.html">snapshot</ulink> release is also made of this -CURRENT development
code, CDROM distributions of the occasional snapshot even now being
made available. The goals behind each snapshot release are:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>To test the latest version of the installation software.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>To give people who would like to run -CURRENT but who don't
have the time and/or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day
basis an easy way of bootstrapping it onto their systems.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code in question,
just in case we break something really badly later. (Although
CVS normally prevents anything horrible like this happening :)
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>To ensure that any new features in need of testing have the
greatest possible number of potential testers.</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
  
<para>No claims are made that any snapshot can be considered
``production quality'' for any purpose.  For stability
and tested mettle, you will have to stick to full releases.</para>
  
<para>Snapshot releases are directly available from <ulink URL="ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/">ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/</ulink> and are generated,
on the average, once a day for both the 4.0-CURRENT and 3.0-STABLE
branches.</para>

<qandaentry><question
id="stable">
<para>What is the FreeBSD-STABLE concept?</para></question><answer>

<para>Back when FreeBSD 2.0.5 was released, we decided to branch FreeBSD
development into two parts.  One branch was named <ulink URL="../handbook/stable.html">-STABLE</ulink>, with the
intention that only well-tested bug fixes and small incremental
enhancements would be made to it (for Internet Service Providers
and other commercial enterprises for whom sudden shifts or
experimental features are quite undesirable).  The other branch was
<ulink URL="../handbook/cutting-edge.html#CURRENT">-CURRENT</ulink>, which
essentially has been one unbroken line leading towards 4.0-RELEASE
(and beyond) since 2.0 was released. If a little ASCII art would
help, this is how it looks:</para>
  
<para>

          [4.0-CURRENT continues]</literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>The -CURRENT branch is slowly progressing towards 4.0 and beyond,
the previous 2.2-STABLE branch having been retired with the release
of 2.2.8.  3.4-STABLE has now replaced it, with 3.4-RELEASE being released
in mid-December 1999.  4.0-CURRENT is now the "current branch",
with the first 4.0 releases appearing in Q1 2000.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question id="release-freq"><para>When are FreeBSD releases made?</para></question><answer>

<para>As a general principle, the FreeBSD core team only release a new
version of FreeBSD when they believe that there are sufficient new
features and/or bug fixes to justify one, and are satisfied that the
changes made have settled down sufficiently to avoid compromising the
stability of the release.  Many users regard this caution as one of
the best things about FreeBSD, although it can be a little
frustrating when waiting for all the latest goodies to become
available...</para>
  
<para>Releases are made about every 4 months on average.</para>
  
<para>For people needing (or wanting) a little more excitement, there are
SNAPs released more frequently, particularly during the month or so
leading up to a release.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Is FreeBSD only available for PCs ?</para></question><answer>

<para>FreeBSD 3.x currently runs on the <ulink URL="../alpha/alpha.html">DEC Alpha</ulink> as well as the
x86 architecture.  Some interest has also been expressed in a
SPARC port, but details on this project are not yet clear.</para>
  
<para>If your machine has a different architecture and
you need something right now, we suggest you look at
<ulink URL="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</ulink> or
<ulink URL="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</ulink>.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para> Who is responsible for FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>The key decisions concerning the FreeBSD project, such as the
overall direction of the project and who is allowed to add code to
the source tree, are made by a <ulink URL="../handbook/staff.html#STAFF-CORE">core team</ulink> of some 15 people. There is a much larger team of
over 150 <ulink URL="../handbook/staff-committers.html">committers</ulink> who are authorized to make changes directly to the
FreeBSD source tree.</para>
  
<para>However, most non-trivial changes are discussed in advance in the
<link linkend="mailing">mailing lists</link>, and there are no restrictions
on who may take part in the discussion.</para>

<para>        Are there FreeBSD IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channels?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>Yes, most major IRC networks host a FreeBSD chat
channel:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Channel <emphasis remap=tt>#FreeBSD</emphasis> on EFNet is
a FreeBSD forum, but don't go there for tech support
or to try and get folks there to help you avoid the pain of
reading man pages or doing your own research.  It is a chat
channel, first and foremost, and topics there are just as likely
to involve sex, sports or nuclear weapons as they are FreeBSD.
You Have Been Warned!
Available at server <hostid>irc.chat.org</hostid>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Channel <emphasis remap=tt>#FreeBSD</emphasis> on DALNET
is available at <hostid>irc.dal.net</hostid> in the US and 
<hostid>irc.eu.dal.net</hostid> in Europe.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Channel <emphasis remap=tt>#FreeBSD</emphasis> on UNDERNET is
available at <hostid>us.undernet.org</hostid> in the US and 
<hostid>eu.undernet.org</hostid> in Europe.  Since it is a help
channel, be prepared to read the documents you are referred to.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
  
<para>Each of these channels are distinct and are not connected to
each other.  Their chat styles also differ, so you may need to try 
each to find one suited to your chat style.  As with *all* types
of IRC traffic, if you're easily offended or can't deal with lots
of young people (and more than a few older ones) doing the verbal
equivalent of jello wrestling, don't even bother with it.</para>

Note that this is a work in progress, and so parts may be incomplete.</para>
  
<para>The definitive printed guide on FreeBSD is ``The Complete FreeBSD'',
written by Greg Lehey and published by Walnut Creek CDROM Books.  Now
in its second edition, the book contains 1,750 pages of install &amp;

<para>Which file do I download to get FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>Prior to release 3.1, you only needed one floppy image to install
FreeBSD, namely <filename>floppies/boot.flp</filename>.  However,
since release 3.1 the Project has added base support for a wide
variety of hardware which needed more space, and thus for 3.x and 4.x
we now use two floppy images, namely
<filename>floppies/kernel.flp</filename> and
<filename>floppies/mfsroot.flp</filename>.  These images need to be
copied onto floppies by tools like <command>fdimage</command> or
&man.dd.1;.</para>

<para>Help! The boot floppy image will not fit on a single floppy!
      </para></question><answer>

<para>A 3.5 inch (1.44MB) floppy can accomodate 1474560 bytes of data.  
The boot image is exactly 1474560 bytes in size.</para>
  
<para>Common mistakes when preparing the boot floppy are:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Not downloading the floppy image in <emphasis remap=tt>binary</emphasis> mode when
using <acronym>FTP</acronym>.  
</para>

<para>Some FTP clients default their transfer mode to <emphasis remap=tt>ascii</emphasis>
and attempt to change any end-of-line characters received to match 
the conventions used by the client's system.
This will almost invariably corrupt the boot image.  Check the
size of the downloaded boot image:  if it is not <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> 
that on the server, then the download process is suspect.</para>

<para>To workaround: type <emphasis remap=tt>binary</emphasis> at the FTP command prompt 
after getting connected to the server and before starting the 
download of the image.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Using the DOS <emphasis remap=tt>copy</emphasis> command (or equivalent GUI tool) to 
transfer the boot image to floppy.
</para>

<para>Programs like <emphasis remap=tt>copy</emphasis> will not work as the boot 
image has been created to be booted into directly.  The image has
the complete content of the floppy, track for track, and is not
meant to be placed on the floppy as a regular file.
You have to transfer it to the floppy ``raw'', using the 
low-level tools (e.g. <emphasis remap=tt>fdimage</emphasis> or <emphasis remap=tt>rawrite</emphasis>)

<qandaentry><question>
<para>What do I need in order to run FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>You'll need a 386 or better PC, with 5 MB or more of RAM and at
least 60 MB of hard disk space.  It can run with a low end MDA
graphics card but to run X11R6, a VGA or better video card is needed.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>I have only 4 MB of RAM. Can I install FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>FreeBSD 2.1.7 was the last version of FreeBSD that could be installed
on a 4MB system.  Newer versions of FreeBSD, like 2.2, need at least 5MB
to install on a new system.</para>
  
<para>All versions of FreeBSD, including 3.0, will RUN in 4MB of ram, they
just can't run the installation program in 4MB.  You can add
extra memory for the install process, if you like, and then
after the system is up and running, go back to 4MB.  Or you could
always just swap your disk into a system which has &gt;4MB, install onto
it and then swap it back.</para>
  
<para>There are also situations in which FreeBSD 2.1.7 will not install
in 4 MB.  To be exact: it does not install with 640 kB base + 3 MB
extended memory.  If your motherboard can remap some of the ``lost''
memory out of the 640kB to 1MB region, then you may still be able
to get FreeBSD 2.1.7 up.</para>
  
<para>Try to go into your BIOS setup and look for a ``remap'' option.
Enable it.  You may also have to disable ROM shadowing.</para>
  
<para>It may be easier to get 4 more MB just for the install. Build a
custom kernel with only the options you need and then get the 4
MB out again.</para>
  
<para>You may also install 2.0.5 and then upgrade your system to 2.1.7
with the ``upgrade'' option of the 2.1.7 installation program.</para>
  
<para>After the installation, if you build a custom kernel, it will run
in 4 MB. Someone has even succeeded in booting with 2 MB (the
system was almost unusable though :-))</para>

<para>        How can I make my own custom install floppy?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>Currently there's no way to *just* make a custom install floppy.
You have to cut a whole new release, which will include your install
floppy. There's some code in <filename>/usr/src/release/floppies/Makefile</filename>
that's supposed to let you *just* make those floppies, but it's not
really gelled yet.</para>

<para>Boot the FreeBSD boot floppy again and go to the Custom
installation menu item.  Choose Partition.  Select the drive which
used to contain your boot manager (likely the first one) and when you
come to the partition editor for it, as the very first thing (e.g.
do not make any changes) select (W)rite.  This will ask for
confirmation, say yes, and when you get the Boot Manager selection
prompt, be sure to select "Boot Manager."
This will re-write the boot manager to disk.  Now quit out of the
installation menu and reboot off the hard disk as normal.</para>

it must unfortunately be said that if you've got an IDE or ESDI drive

<para>Strange things happen when I boot the install floppy!</para></question><answer>

<para>If you're seeing things like the machine grinding to a halt or
spontaneously rebooting when you try to boot the install floppy,
here are three questions to ask yourself:-</para>
  
<para>
<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Did you use a new, freshly-formatted, error-free floppy
(preferably a brand-new one straight out of the box, as
opposed to the magazine coverdisk that's been lying under
the bed for the last three years)?
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Did you download the floppy image in binary (or image) mode?
(don't be embarrassed, even the best of us have accidentally
downloaded a binary file in ASCII mode at least once!)
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>If you're using one of these new-fangled operating systems
like Windows95 or Windows NT, did you shut it down and restart
the system in plain, honest DOS?  It seems these OS's can
interfere with programs that write directly to hardware, which
the disk creation program does; even running it inside a DOS
shell in the GUI can cause this problem.</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>
</para>
  
<para>There have also been reports of Netscape causing problems when
downloading the boot floppy, so it's probably best to use a different
FTP client if you can.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Help! I can't install from tape!</para></question><answer>

<para>If you are installing 2.1.7R from tape, you  must create the tape
using a tar blocksize of 10 (5120 bytes).  The default tar
blocksize is 20 (10240 bytes), and tapes created using this
default size cannot be used to install 2.1.7R; with these tapes,
you will get an error that complains about  the record size being

<qandaentry><question
id="geometry">
<para>        Which geometry should I use for a disk drive?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>(By the "geometry" of a disk, we mean the number of cylinders,
heads and sectors/track on a disk - I'll refer to this as
C/H/S for convenience.  This is how the PC's BIOS works out
which area on a disk to read/write from).</para>
  
<para>This seems to cause a lot of confusion for some reason.  First
of all, the <emphasis remap=tt>physical</emphasis> geometry of a SCSI drive is totally
irrelevant, as FreeBSD works in term of disk blocks.  In fact, there
is no such thing as "the" physical geometry, as the sector density
varies across the disk - what manufacturers claim is the "true"
physical geometry is usually the geometry that they've worked out
results in the least wasted space.  For IDE disks, FreeBSD does
work in terms of C/H/S, but all modern drives will convert this
into block references internally as well.</para>
  
<para>All that matters is the <emphasis remap=tt>logical</emphasis> geometry - the answer that the
BIOS gets when it asks "what is your geometry?" and then uses to access
the disk.  As FreeBSD uses the BIOS when booting, it's very important
to get this right.  In particular, if you have more than one operating
system on a disk, they must all agree on the geometry, otherwise you
will have serious problems booting!</para>
  
<para>For SCSI disks, the geometry to use depends on whether extended
translation support is turned on in your controller (this is
often referred to as "support for DOS disks &gt;1GB" or something
similar).  If it's turned off, then use N cylinders, 64 heads
and 32 sectors/track, where 'N' is the capacity of the disk in
MB.  For example, a 2GB disk should pretend to have 2048 cylinders,
64 heads and 32 sectors/track.</para>
  
<para>If it <emphasis remap=tt>is</emphasis> turned on (it's often supplied this way to get around
certain limitations in MSDOS) and the disk capacity is more than 1GB,
use M cylinders, 63 sectors per track (*not* 64), and 255 heads, where
'M' is the disk capacity in MB divided by 7.844238 (!).  So our
example 2GB drive would have 261 cylinders, 63 sectors per track and
255 heads.</para>
  
<para>If you are not sure about this, or FreeBSD fails to detect the
geometry correctly during installation, the simplest way around
this is usually to create a small DOS partition on the disk.  The
correct geometry should then be detected (and you can always remove
the DOS partition in the partition editor if you don't want to keep
it, or leave it around for programming network cards and the like).</para>
  
<para>Alternatively, there is a freely available utility distributed with
FreeBSD called ``<filename>pfdisk.exe</filename>'' (located in the <emphasis remap=tt>tools</emphasis>
subdirectory on the FreeBSD CDROM or on the various FreeBSD
ftp sites) which can be used to work out what geometry the other
operating systems on the disk are using.  You can then enter this
geometry in the partition editor.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Any restrictions on how I divide the disk up?</para></question><answer>

<para>Yes. You must make sure that your root partition is below 1024
cylinders so the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.  (Note that this
is a limitation in the PC's BIOS, not FreeBSD).</para>
  
<para>For a SCSI drive, this will normally imply that the root partition
will be in the first 1024MB (or in the first 4096MB if extended
translation is turned on - see previous question).  For IDE, the
corresponding figure is 504MB.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>        What about disk managers? Or, I have a large drive!
      </para></question><answer>

<para>FreeBSD recognizes the Ontrack Disk Manager and makes allowances
for it. Other disk managers are not supported.</para>
  
<para>If you just want to use the disk with FreeBSD you don't need a
disk manager. Just configure the disk for as much space as the
BIOS can deal with (usually 504 megabytes), and FreeBSD
should figure out how much space you really have. If you're using
an old disk with an MFM controller, you may need to explicitly
tell FreeBSD how many cylinders to use.</para>
  
<para>If you want to use the disk with FreeBSD and another operating
system, you may be able to do without a disk manager: just make sure
the the FreeBSD boot partition and the slice for the other
operating system are in the first 1024 cylinders. If you're
reasonably careful, a 20 megabyte boot partition should be plenty.</para>

<para>Do I need to install the complete sources?</para></question><answer>

<para>In general, no.  However, we would strongly recommend that you
install, at a minimum, the ``<emphasis remap=tt>base</emphasis>'' source kit, which
includes several of the files mentioned here, and the
``<emphasis remap=tt>sys</emphasis>'' (kernel) source kit, which includes sources for the
kernel.  There is nothing in the system which requires the
presence of the sources to operate, however, except for the
kernel-configuration program 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?config">config</ulink>.  With the exception
of the kernel sources, our build structure is set up so that you
can read-only mount the sources from elsewhere via NFS and still
be able to make new binaries.  (Because of the kernel-source
restriction, we recommend that you not mount this on
<filename>/usr/src</filename> directly, but rather in some other location
with appropriate symbolic links to duplicate the top-level
structure of the source tree.)</para>
  
<para>Having the sources on-line and knowing how to build a system with
them will make it much easier for you to upgrade to future
releases of FreeBSD.</para>
  
<para>To actually select a subset of the sources, use the Custom
menu item when you are in the Distributions menu of the
system installation tool.  The <filename>src/install.sh</filename> script
will also install partial pieces of the source distribution,
depending on the arguments you pass it.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Do I need to build a kernel?</para></question><answer>

<para>Building a new kernel was originally pretty much a required
step in a FreeBSD installation, but more recent releases have
benefited from the introduction of a much friendlier kernel
configuration tool. When at the FreeBSD boot prompt (boot:),
use the "-c" flag and you will be dropped into a visual
configuration screen which allows you to configure the kernel's
settings for most common ISA cards.</para>
  
<para>It's still recommended that you eventually build a new
kernel containing just the drivers that you need, just to save a
bit of RAM, but it's no longer a strict requirement for most
systems.</para>

<para>I live outside the US. Can I use DES encryption?</para></question><answer>

<para>If it is not absolutely imperative that you use DES style
encryption, you can use FreeBSD's default encryption for even
<emphasis remap=bf>better</emphasis> security, and with no export restrictions.  FreeBSD
2.0's password default scrambler is now <emphasis remap=bf>MD5</emphasis>-based, and is
more CPU-intensive to crack with an automated password cracker
than DES, and allows longer passwords as well. The only reason
for not using the <emphasis remap=bf>MD5</emphasis>-based crypt today would be to use the
the same password entries on FreeBSD and non-FreeBSD systems.</para>
  
<para>Since the DES encryption algorithm cannot legally be exported
from the US, non-US users should not download this software (as

<para>I get a ``panic: cant mount root'' error when rebooting the system after installation.</para></question><answer>

<para>This error comes from confusion between the boot block's and the 
kernel's understanding of the disk devices.  The error usually 
manifests on two-disk IDE systems, with the hard disks arranged as the
master or single device on separate IDE controllers, with FreeBSD
installed on the secondary IDE controller.  The boot blocks think
the system is installed on wd1 (the second BIOS disk) while the kernel
assigns the first disk on the secondary controller device wd2.  After
the device probing, the kernel tries to mount what the boot blocks 
think is the boot disk, wd1, while it is really wd2, and fails.</para>

<para>Once you get the mouse daemon running (see <link linkend="moused">previous section</link>), hold down the button 1 (left button) 
and move the mouse to select a region of
text.  Then, press the button 2 (middle button) or the button 3 (right
button) to paste it at the text cursor.</para>
  
<para>In versions 2.2.6 and later, pressing the button 2 will paste 
the text.  Pressing the button 3 will ``extend'' the selected region
of text.  If your mouse does not have the middle button, you may wish
to emulate it or remap buttons using moused options.  See the

<para>The following paragraphs were submitted by 
<ulink URL="mailto:tedm@toybox.placo.com">Ted Mittelstaedt</ulink>:</para>
  
<para>For IDE drives, any bad block is usually a sign of potential trouble.
All modern IDE drives come with internal bad-block remapping turned 
on.  All IDE hard drive manufacturers today offer extensive 
warranties and will replace drives with bad blocks on them.</para>
  
<para>If you still want to attempt to rescue an IDE drive with bad blocks,
you can attempt to download the IDE drive manufacturer's IDE diagnostic 
program, and run this against the drive.  Sometimes these programs can 
be set to force the drive electronics to rescan the drive for bad blocks 
and lock them out.</para>
  
<para>For ESDI, RLL and MFM drives, bad blocks are a normal part of the 
drive and are no sign of trouble, generally.  With a PC, the disk drive 
controller card and BIOS handle the task of locking out bad sectors.  
This is fine for operating systems like DOS that use BIOS code to 
access the disk.  However, FreeBSD's disk driver does not go through 
BIOS, therefore a mechanism, bad144, exists that replaces this 
functionality.  bad144 only works with the wd driver,
it is NOT able to be used with SCSI.  bad144 works by entering all bad
sectors found into a special file.</para>
  
<para>One caveat with bad144 - the bad block special file is placed on the 
last track of the disk.  As this file may possibly contain a listing for
a bad sector that would occur near the beginning of the disk, where the 
/kernel file might be located, it therefore must be accessible to the 
bootstrap program that uses BIOS calls to read the kernel file.  This 
means that the disk with bad144 used on it must not exceed 1024 
cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors.  This places an effective limit 
of 500MB on a disk that is mapped with bad144.</para>
  
<para>To use bad144, simply set the "Bad Block" scanning to ON in the 
FreeBSD fdisk screen during the initial install.  This works up through 
FreeBSD 2.2.7. The disk must have less than 1024 cylinders.  It is 
generally recommended that the disk drive has been in operation for at 
least 4 hours prior to this to allow for thermal expansion and track 
wandering.</para>
  
<para>If the disk has more than 1024 cylinders (such as a large ESDI drive)
the ESDI controller uses a special translation mode to make it work 
under DOS. The wd driver understands about these translation modes, 
IF you enter the "translated" geometry with the "set geometry" command 
in fdisk.  You must also NOT use the "dangerously dedicated" mode of 
creating the FreeBSD partition, as this ignores the geometry.  Also, 
even though fdisk will use your overridden geometry, it still knows the 
true size of the disk, and will attempt to create a too large FreeBSD 
partition.  If the disk geometry is changed to the translated geometry, 
the partition MUST be manually created with the number of blocks.</para>
  
<para>A quick trick to use is to set up the large ESDI disk with the ESDI 
controller, boot it with a DOS disk and format it with a DOS partition.
Then, boot the FreeBSD install and in the fdisk screen, read off and 
write down the blocksize and block numbers for the DOS partition.  Then, 
reset the geometry to the same that DOS uses, delete the DOS partition, 
and create a "cooperative" FreeBSD partition using the blocksize you 
recorded earlier.  Then, set the partition bootable and turn on bad 
block scanning.  During the actual install, bad144 will run first, 
before any filesystems are created.  (you can view this with an Alt-F2)  
If it has any trouble creating the badsector file, you have set too 
large a disk geometry - reboot the system and start all over again  
(including repartitioning and reformatting with DOS).</para>
  
<para>If remapping is enabled and you are seeing bad blocks, consider 
replacing the drive. The bad blocks will only get worse as time goes on.</para>

<para>FreeBSD does not recognize my Bustek 742a EISA SCSI!</para></question><answer>

<para>This info is specific to the 742a but may also cover other
Buslogic cards.  (Bustek = Buslogic)</para>
  
<para>There are 2 general ``versions'' of the 742a card.  They are
hardware revisions A-G, and revisions H - onwards.  The revision
letter is located after the Assembly number on the edge of the
card.  The 742a has 2 ROM chips on it, one is the BIOS chip and
the other is the Firmware chip.  FreeBSD doesn't care what
version of BIOS chip you have but it does care about what version
of firmware chip.  Buslogic will send upgrade ROMS out if you
call their tech support dept.  The BIOS and Firmware chips are
shipped as a matched pair.  You must have the most current
Firmware ROM in your adapter card for your hardware revision.</para>
  
<para>The REV A-G cards can only accept BIOS/Firmware sets up to
2.41/2.21.  The REV H- up cards can accept the most current
BIOS/Firmware sets of 4.70/3.37. The difference between the
firmware sets is that the 3.37 firmware supports ``round robin''</para>
  
<para>The Buslogic cards also have a serial number on them.  If you
have a old hardware revision card you can call the Buslogic RMA
department and give them the serial number and attempt to
exchange the card for a newer hardware revision.  If the card is
young enough they will do so.</para>
  
<para>FreeBSD 2.1 only supports Firmware revisions 2.21 onward.  If you
have a Firmware revision older than this your card will not be
recognized as a Buslogic card.  It may be recognized as an
Adaptec 1540, however.  The early Buslogic firmware contains an
AHA1540 ``emulation'' mode.  This is not a good thing for an EISA
card, however.</para>
  
<para>If you have an old hardware revision card and you obtain the 2.21
firmware for it, you will need to check the position of jumper W1
to B-C, the default is A-B.</para>
  
<para>The 742a EISA cards never had the ``&gt;16MB'' problem mentioned in
the section <link linkend="bigram">on &gt;16 MB machines</link>. This is a
problem that occurs with the Vesa-Local Buslogic SCSI cards.</para>

<para>        My HP Netserver's SCSI controller is not detected!

<para>This is basically a known problem.  The EISA on-board SCSI controller
in the HP Netserver machines occupies EISA slot number 11, so all
the ``true'' EISA slots are in front of it.  Alas, the address space
for EISA slots &gt;= 10 collides with the address space assigned to PCI,
and FreeBSD's auto-configuration currently cannot handle this
situation very well.</para>
  
<para>So now, the best you can do is to pretend there is no address
range clash :), by bumping the kernel option <symbol>EISA_SLOTS</symbol>
to a value of 12.
Configure and compile a kernel, as described in the
<ulink URL="../handbook/kernelconfig.html">Handbook entry on configuring the kernel</ulink>.</para>
  
<para>Of course, this does present you with a chicken-and-egg problem when

conflicts are no  longer tolerated.  Boot with the -c option and
change the ed0/de0/... entry to match your board.</para>

<para>When I mount a CDROM, I get ``Incorrect super block''.</para></question><answer>

<para>You have to tell 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount">mount</ulink>
the type of the device that you want to mount.  By default, 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount">mount</ulink>
will assume the filesystem is of type ``<emphasis remap=tt>ufs</emphasis>''.  You want to mount
a CDROM filesystem, and you do this by specifying the ``<option>-t cd9660</option>''
option to <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount">mount</ulink>.  This does, of course, assume that the
CDROM contains an ISO 9660 filesystem, which is what most CDROMs
have.  As of 1.1R, FreeBSD automatically understands the Rock Ridge
(long filename) extensions as well.</para>
  
<para>As an example, if you want to mount the CDROM device,
``<filename>/dev/cd0c</filename>'', under <filename>/mnt</filename>, you would execute:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0c /mnt
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Note that your device name (``<filename>/dev/cd0c</filename>'' in this
example) could be different, depending on the CDROM interface.
Note that the ``<option>-t cd9660</option>'' option just causes the
``<symbol>mount_cd9660</symbol>'' command to be executed, and so the
above example could be shortened to:</para>

Adaptec 1542, when you're beating on memory by compiling a kernel,
or just when the system's running particularly hot).</para>

<qandaentry><question
id="reallybigram">
<para>        I have 128 MB of RAM but the system only uses 64 MB.
        
      </para></question><answer>

<para>Due to the manner in which FreeBSD gets the memory size from the
BIOS, it can only detect 16 bits worth of Kbytes in size (65535
Kbytes = 64MB) (or less... some BIOSes peg the memory size to 16M).
If you have more than 64MB, FreeBSD will attempt to detect it;
however, the attempt may fail.</para>
  
<para>To work around this problem, you need to use the
kernel option specified below. There is a way to get complete
memory information from the BIOS, but we don't have room in the
bootblocks to do it. Someday when lack of room in the bootblocks
is fixed, we'll use the extended BIOS functions to get the full
memory information...but for now we're stuck with the kernel
option.</para>

<para>FreeBSD 2.0 panics with ``kmem_map too small!''</para></question><answer>

<para><emphasis remap=tt>Note</emphasis> The message may also be ``mb_map too small!''</para>
  
<para>The panic indicates that the system ran out of virtual memory for
network buffers (specifically, mbuf clusters). You can increase
the amount of VM available for mbuf clusters by adding:</para>
  
<para><literal>options "NMBCLUSTERS=&lt;n&gt;"</literal></para>
  
<para>to your kernel config file, where &lt;n&gt; is a number in the
range 512-4096, depending on the number of concurrent TCP
connections you need to support. I'd recommend trying 2048 - this
should get rid of the panic completely. You can monitor the
number of mbuf clusters allocated/in use on the system with
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?netstat">netstat -m</ulink>.  The default value for NMBCLUSTERS is 
<emphasis remap=tt>512 + MAXUSERS * 16</emphasis>.</para>

<para>

        553 relay.domain.net config error: mail loops back to myself
        554 &lt;user@domain.net&gt;... Local configuration error

        How can I solve this problem?

        You have asked mail to the domain (e.g., domain.net) to be
        forwarded to a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net)
        by using an MX record, but the relay machine doesn't recognize
        itself as domain.net.  Add domain.net to /etc/sendmail.cw
        (if you are using FEATURE(use_cw_file)) or add "Cw domain.net"

<para>Full screen applications on remote machines misbehave</para></question>
<answer>

<para>The remote machine may be setting your terminal type
to something other than the <emphasis remap=tt>cons25</emphasis> terminal type 
required by the FreeBSD console.</para>
  
<para>There are a number of possible work-arounds for this problem:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>After logging on to the remote machine, set your TERM shell 
variable to <emphasis remap=tt>ansi</emphasis> or 
<emphasis remap=tt>sco</emphasis> if the remote machine knows
about these terminal types.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Use a VT100 emulator like <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi?screen-">screen</ulink> 
at the FreeBSD console.  
<emphasis remap=tt>screen</emphasis> offers you the ability to run multiple 
concurrent sessions from one terminal, and is a neat program in its own right.  
Each <emphasis remap=tt>screen</emphasis> window behaves like a VT100 terminal,
so the TERM variable at the remote end should be set to <emphasis remap=tt>
vt100</emphasis>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Install the <emphasis remap=tt>cons25</emphasis> terminal database entry on 
the remote machine.  The way to do this depends on the operating system on the
remote machine.  The system administration manuals for the remote system
should be able to help you here.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Fire up an X server at the FreeBSD end and login to the remote machine 
using an X based terminal emulator such as <emphasis remap=tt>xterm</emphasis> or 
<emphasis remap=tt>rxvt</emphasis>. The TERM variable at the remote host 
should be set to <emphasis remap=tt>xterm</emphasis> or <emphasis remap=tt>vt100

<qandaentry><question>
<para>My machine prints "calcru: negative time..."</para></question><answer>

<para>This can be caused by various hardware and/or software ailments 
relating to interrupts.  It may be due to bugs but can also happen 
by nature of certain devices.  Running TCP/IP over the parallel 
port using a large MTU is one good way to provoke this problem.  
Graphics accelerators can also get you here, in which case you 
should check the interrupt setting of the card first.</para>
  
<para>A side effect of this problem are dying processes with the 
message "SIGXCPU exceeded cpu time limit".</para>
  
<para>For FreeBSD 3.0 and later from Nov 29, 1998 forward: If the 
problem cannot be fixed otherwise the solution is to set 
this sysctl variable:
<literallayout>               sysctl -w kern.timecounter.method=1</literallayout>
</para>
  
<para> This means a performance impact, but considering the cause of 
this problem, you probably will not notice.  If the problem 
persists, keep the sysctl set to one and set the "NTIMECOUNTER" 
option in your kernel to increasingly large values.  If by the 
time you have reached "NTIMECOUNTER=20" the problem isn't 
solved, interrupts are too hosed on your machine for reliable 
timekeeping.</para>

<qandaset><qandaentry><question>
<para>Where are the system start-up configuration files?</para></question><answer>

<para>From 2.0.5R to 2.2.1R, the primary configuration file is
<filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>. All the options are to be specified in
this file and other files such as <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc">/etc/rc</ulink> and
<filename>/etc/netstart</filename> just include it.</para>
  
<para>Look in the <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> file and change the value to
match your system. This file is filled with comments to show what
to put in there.</para>
  
<para>In post-2.2.1 and 3.0, <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> was renamed
to a more self-describing <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf(5)">rc.conf</ulink>
file and the syntax cleaned up a bit in the process.
<filename>/etc/netstart</filename> was also renamed to <filename>/etc/rc.network</filename>
so that all files could be copied with a <command><ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?cp">cp</ulink> /usr/src/etc/rc*
/etc</command> command.</para>
  
<para><filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> is here as always and may be used to
start up additional local services like <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi?^inn">INN</ulink>
or set custom options.</para>
  
<para>The <filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename> is for serial port initialization
(e.g. locking the port characteristics, and so on.).</para>
  
<para>The <filename>/etc/rc.i386</filename> is for Intel-specifics settings, such
as iBCS2 emulation or the PC system console configuration.</para>
  
<para>Starting with 2.1.0R, you can also have "local" startup files in a
directory specified in <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> (or
<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>):</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        # Location of local startup files.
        local_startup=/usr/local/etc/rc.local.d
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Each file ending in <filename>.sh</filename> will be executed in alphabetical order.</para>
  
<para>If you want to ensure a certain execution order without changing all
the file names, you can use a scheme similar to the following with
digits prepended to each file name to insure the ordering:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        10news.sh
        15httpd.sh
        20ssh.sh
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>It can be seen as ugly (or SysV :-)) but it provides a simple and
regular scheme for locally-added packages without resorting to
magical editing of <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>.  Many of the ports/packages
assume that <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> is a local startup directory.</para>

<para>Whether it's a removable drive like a ZIP or an EZ drive (or
even a floppy, if you want to use it that way), or a new hard
disk, once it's installed and recognized by the system, and
you have your cartridge/floppy/whatever slotted in, things are
pretty much the same for all devices.</para>
  
<para><anchor id="disklabel">(this section is based on <ulink URL="http://www.vmunix.com/mark/FreeBSD/ZIP-FAQ.html">Mark Mayo's ZIP FAQ</ulink>)</para>
  
<para>If it's a ZIP drive or a floppy , you've already got a DOS
filesystem on it, you can use a command like this:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        mount -t msdos /dev/fd0c /floppy
      </literallayout>

<literallayout>        mount -t msdos /dev/da2s4 /zip
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>for a ZIP disk with the factory configuration.</para>
  
<para>For other disks, see how they're laid out using <emphasis remap=tt>fdisk</emphasis> or
<filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>.</para>
  
<para>The rest of the examples will be for a ZIP drive on da2, the third
SCSI disk.</para>
  
<para>Unless it's a floppy, or a removable you plan on sharing with
other people, it's probably a better idea to stick a BSD file
system on it. You'll get long filename support, at least a 2X
improvement in performance, and a lot more stability. First, you
need to redo the DOS-level partitions/filesystems. You can either
use <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?fdisk">fdisk</ulink> or <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename>, or for a small
drive that you don't want to bother with multiple operating system
support on, just blow away the whole FAT partition table (slices)
and just use the BSD partitioning:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rda2 count=2
        disklabel -Brw da2 auto
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>You can use disklabel or <filename>/stand/sysinstall</filename> to create multiple
BSD partitions. You'll certainly want to do this if you're adding
swap space on a fixed disk, but it's probably irrelevant on a
removable drive like a ZIP.</para>
  
<para>Finally, create a new file system, this one's on our ZIP drive
using the whole disk:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        newfs /dev/rda2c
      </literallayout>

<para>and mount it:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        mount /dev/da2c /zip
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>and it's probably a good idea to add a line like this to
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?fstab">/etc/fstab</ulink> so you can just type "mount /zip" in the

<para>How can I use the NT loader to boot FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>This procedure is slightly different for 2.2.x and 3.x (with the
3-stage boot) systems.</para>

<para>The general idea is that you copy the first sector of your
native root FreeBSD partition into a file in the DOS/NT
partition.  Assuming you name that file something like
<filename>c:\bootsect.bsd</filename> (inspired by <filename>c:\bootsect.dos</filename>),
you can then edit the <filename>c:\boot.ini</filename> file to come up with
something like this:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        [boot loader]
        timeout=30
        default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS

        C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="FreeBSD"
        C:\="DOS"
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>For 2.2.x systems this procedure assumes that DOS, NT, FreeBSD, or whatever
have been installed into their respective fdisk partitions on the
<emphasis remap=bf>same</emphasis> disk.  In my case DOS &amp; NT are in the first fdisk
partition and FreeBSD is in the second.  I also installed FreeBSD
to boot from its native partition, <emphasis remap=bf>not</emphasis> the disk MBR.</para>
  
<para>Mount a DOS-formatted floppy (if you've converted to NTFS) or the
FAT partition, under, say, <filename>/mnt</filename>.</para>

<para>Reboot into DOS or NT.  NTFS users copy the <filename>bootsect.bsd</filename>

<para>        How do I boot FreeBSD and Linux from LILO?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>If you have FreeBSD and Linux on the same disk, just follow 
LILO's installation instructions for booting a non-Linux operating 
system.  Very briefly, these are:</para>
  
<para>Boot Linux, and add the following lines to 
<filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>:
<programlisting>      other=/dev/hda2
	      table=/dev/hda
	      label=FreeBSD
      </programlisting>

(the above assumes that your FreeBSD slice is known to Linux as 
<filename>/dev/hda2</filename>; tailor to suit your setup).  Then, 
run <command>lilo</command> as root and you should be done.</para>
  
<para>If FreeBSD resides on another disk, you need to add 
``<literal>loader=/boot/chain.b</literal>'' to the LILO entry.  
For example:
<programlisting>      other=/dev/dab4
	      table=/dev/dab
	      loader=/boot/chain.b
	      label=FreeBSD
      </programlisting>
</para>
  
<para>In some cases you may need to specify the BIOS drive number 
to the FreeBSD boot loader to successfully boot off the second disk.  
For example, if your FreeBSD SCSI disk is probed by BIOS as BIOS 
disk 1, at the FreeBSD boot loader prompt you need to specify:
<literallayout>      Boot: 1:da(0,a)/kernel
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>On FreeBSD 2.2.5 and later, you can configure <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?boot(8)">boot(8)</ulink>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>        Will a ``dangerously dedicated'' disk endanger my health?
      </para></question><answer>

<para><anchor id="dedicate">The installation procedure allows you to chose
two different methods in partitioning your harddisk(s).  The default way
makes it compatible with other operating systems on the same machine,
by using fdisk table entries (called ``slices'' in FreeBSD),
with a FreeBSD slice that employs partitions of its own.
Optionally, one can chose to install a boot-selector to switch
between the possible operating systems on the disk(s).
The alternative uses the entire disk for FreeBSD, and makes
no attempt to be compatible with other operating systems.</para>
  
<para>So why it is called ``dangerous''?  A disk in this mode
doesn't contain what normal PC utilities would consider a
valid fdisk table.  Depending on how well they have been
designed, they might complain at you once they are getting
in contact with such a disk, or even worse, they might
damage the BSD bootstrap without even asking or notifying
you.  In addition, the ``dangerously dedicated'' disk's layout
is known to confuse many BIOSsen, including those from AWARD
(eg. as found in HP Netserver and Micronics systems as well as
many others) and Symbios/NCR (for the popular 53C8xx range of 
SCSI controllers).  This isn't a complete list, there are more.
Symptoms of this confusion include the "read error" message
printed by the FreeBSD bootstrap when it can't find itself,
as well as system lockups when booting.</para>
  
<para>Why have this mode at all then?  It only saves a few kbytes
of disk space, and it can cause real problems for a new 
installation.  ``Dangerously dedicated'' mode's origins lie
in a desire to avoid one of the most common problems plaguing
new FreeBSD installers - matching the BIOS ``geometry'' numbers
for a disk to the disk itself.</para>
  
<para>``Geometry'' is an outdated concept, but one still at the
heart of the PC's BIOS and its interaction with disks.  When
the FreeBSD installer creates slices, it has to record the
location of these slices on the disk in a fashion that
corresponds with the way the BIOS expects to find them.  If
it gets it wrong, you won't be able to boot.</para>
  
<para>``Dangerously dedicated'' mode tries to work around this
by making the problem simpler.  In some cases, it gets it right.
But it's meant to be used as a last-ditch alternative - there
are better ways to solve the problem 99 times out of 100.</para>
  
<para>So, how do you avoid the need for ``DD'' mode when you're
installing?  Start by making a note of the geometry that your
BIOS claims to be using for your disks.  You can arrange to have
the kernel print this as it boots by specifying ``-v'' at the 
``boot:'' prompt, or using ``boot -v'' in the loader.  Just 
before the installer starts, the kernel will print a list of 
BIOS geometries.  Don't panic - wait for the installer to start
and then use scrollback to read the numbers.  Typically the BIOS
disk units will be in the same order that FreeBSD lists your 
disks, first IDE, then SCSI.</para>
  
<para>When you're slicing up your disk, check that the disk geometry 
displayed in the FDISK screen is correct (ie. it matches the BIOS 
numbers); if it's wrong, use the ``g'' key to fix it.  You may have 
to do this if there's absolutely nothing on the disk, or if the
disk has been moved from another system.  Note that this is only 
an issue with the disk that you're going to boot from; FreeBSD
will sort itself out just fine with any other disks you may have.</para>
  
<para>Once you've got the BIOS and FreeBSD agreeing about the 
geometry of the disk, your problems are almost guaranteed to be 
over, and with no need for ``DD'' mode at all.  If, however,
you are still greeted with the dreaded ``read error'' message
when you try to boot, it's time to cross your fingers and 
go for it - there's nothing left to lose.</para>
  
<para>To return a ``dangerously dedicated'' disk for normal PC
use, there are basically two options.  The first is, you
write enough NULL bytes over the MBR to make any subsequent
installation believe this to be a blank disk.  You can do
this for example with</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rda0 count=15
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Alternatively, the undocumented DOS ``feature''</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        fdisk /mbr
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>will to install a new master boot record as well, thus clobbering the
BSD bootstrap.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>How can I add more swap space?</para></question><answer>

<para>The best way is to increase the size of your swap partition, or
take advantage of this convenient excuse to add another disk.  The
general rule of thumb is to have around 2x the swap space as you have
main memory.  However, if you have a very small amount of main memory
you may want to configure swap beyond that.  It is also a good idea
to configure sufficient swap relative to anticipated future memory
upgrades so you do not have to futz with your swap configuration later.</para>
  
<para>Adding swap onto a separate disk makes things faster than
simply adding swap onto the same disk.  As an example, if you
are compiling source located on one disk, and the swap is on
another disk, this is much faster than both swap and compile
on the same disk.  This is true for SCSI disks specifically.</para>
  
<para>When you have several disks, configuring a swap partition on
each one is usually beneficial, even if you wind up putting swap on a
work disk.  Typically, each fast disk in your system should have some
swap configured.  FreeBSD supports up to 4 interleaved swap devices by 
default.  When configuring multiple swap partitions you generally
want to make them all about the same size, but people sometimes make 
their primary swap parition larger in order to accomodate a kernel
core dump.   Your primary swap partition must be at least as large as
main memory in order to be able to accomodate a kernel core.</para>
  
<para>IDE drives are not able to allow access to both drives on
the same channel at the same time (FreeBSD doesn't support mode 4, so
all IDE disk I/O is ``programmed'').  I would still suggest putting
your swap on a separate drive however.  The drives are so cheap,
it is not worth worrying about.</para>
  
<para>Swapping over NFS is only recommended if you do not have a local
disk to swap to.  Swapping over NFS is slow and inefficient in FreeBSD
releases prior to 4.x, but reasonably fast in releases greater or 
equal to 4.0.  Even so, it will be limited to the network bandwidth
available and puts an additional burden on the NFS server.</para>

</para>
  
<para>This usually happens when you are trying to concatenate the
`c' partitions, which default to type `unused'.  The ccd
driver requires the underlying partition type to be
FS_BSDFFS.  Edit the disklabel of the disks you are trying
to concatenate and change the types of partitions to
`4.2BSD'.</para>

<para>The symptom of this is:</para>

        use "disklabel -r" to install initial label
        #

</para>
  
<para>This is because the disklabel returned by ccd is actually a

<qandaentry><question
id="uucpmail">
<para>        How do I use sendmail for mail delivery with UUCP?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>The sendmail configuration that ships with FreeBSD is
suited for sites that connect directly to the Internet.
Sites that wish to exchange their mail via UUCP must install
another sendmail configuration file.</para>
  
<para>Tweaking <filename>/etc/sendmail.cf</filename> manually is considered
something for purists.  Sendmail version 8 comes with a
new approach of generating config files via some 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?m4">m4</ulink> preprocessing, where the actual hand-crafted configuration
is on a higher abstraction level.  You should use the
configuration files under</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>If you didn't install your system with full sources, the sendmail
config stuff has been broken out into a separate source distribution
tarball just for you.  Assuming you've got your CD-ROM mounted, do:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        cd /usr/src
        tar -xvzf /cdrom/dists/src/ssmailcf.aa
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Don't panic, this is only a few hundred kilobytes in size.
The file <acronym>README</acronym> in the <emphasis remap=tt>cf</emphasis> directory can
serve as a basic introduction to m4 configuration.</para>
  
<para>For UUCP delivery, you are best advised to use the
<emphasis>mailertable</emphasis> feature.  This constitutes a database
that sendmail can use to base its routing decision upon.</para>
  
<para>First, you have to create your <filename>.mc</filename> file.  The
directory <filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</filename> is the
home of these files.  Look around, there are already a few
examples.  Assuming you have named your file <filename>foo.mc</filename>,
all you need to do in order to convert it into a valid
<filename>sendmail.cf</filename> is:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf
        make foo.cf
        cp foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>A typical <filename>.mc</filename> file might look like:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        include(`../m4/cf.m4')
        VERSIONID(`Your version number')
        OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

        FEATURE(nodns)
        FEATURE(nocanonify)
        FEATURE(mailertable)

        define(`UUCP_RELAY', your.uucp.relay)
        define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)

        MAILER(local)
        MAILER(smtp)
        MAILER(uucp)

        Cw    your.alias.host.name
        Cw    youruucpnodename.UUCP
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>The <emphasis>nodns</emphasis> and <emphasis>nocanonify</emphasis> features will
prevent any usage of the DNS during mail delivery.  The
<symbol>UUCP_RELAY</symbol> clause is needed for bizarre reasons,
don't ask.  Simply put an Internet hostname there that
is able to handle .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely,
you will enter the mail relay of your ISP there.</para>
  
<para>Once you've got this, you need this file called
<filename>/etc/mailertable</filename>.  A typical example of this
gender again:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        #
        # makemap hash /etc/mailertable.db &lt; /etc/mailertable
        #
        horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
        .interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
        interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
        .heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1
        horus.UUCP                    uucp-dom:horus
        if-bus.UUCP                   uucp-dom:if-bus
        .                             uucp-dom:sax
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>As you can see, this is part of a real-life file.  The first
three lines handle special cases where domain-addressed mail
should not be sent out to the default route, but instead to
some UUCP neighbor in order to ``shortcut'' the delivery
path.  The next line handles mail to the local Ethernet
domain that can be delivered using SMTP.  Finally, the UUCP
neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP pseudo-domain notation,
to allow for a ``uucp-neighbor!recipient'' override of the
default rules.  The last line is always a single dot, matching
everything else, with UUCP delivery to a UUCP neighbor that
serves as your universal mail gateway to the world.  All of
the node names behind the <emphasis remap=tt>uucp-dom:</emphasis> keyword must
be valid UUCP neighbors, as you can verify using the
command <emphasis remap=tt>uuname</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a
DBM database file before being usable, the command line to
accomplish this is best placed as a comment at the top of
the mailertable.  You always have to execute this command
each time you change your mailertable.</para>
  
<para>Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular
mail routing would work, remember the <option>-bt</option> option to
sendmail.  It starts sendmail in <emphasis>address test mode</emphasis>;
simply enter ``0 '', followed by the address you wish to
test for the mail routing.  The last line tells you the used
internal mail agent, the destination host this agent will be
called with, and the (possibly translated) address.  Leave
this mode by typing Control-D.</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        j@uriah 191% sendmail -bt
        ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
        Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;

        rewrite: ruleset  0   input: foo @ interface-business . de

        rewrite: ruleset  0 returns: $# uucp-dom $@ if-bus $: foo \

<qandaentry><question
id="ispmail">
<para>        How do I set up mail with a dialup connection to the 'net?
        
      </para></question><answer>

<para>If you've got a statically assigned IP number, you should not
need to adjust anything from the default.  Set your host name up
as your assigned internet name and sendmail will do the rest.</para>
  
<para>If you've got a dynamically assigned IP number and use a dialup
<emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> connection to the internet, you will probably be given a
mailbox on your ISPs mail server.  Lets assume your ISPs domain is
<filename>myISP.com</filename>, and that your user name is <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis>.  Lets also
assume you've called your machine <filename>bsd.home</filename> and that your ISP
has told you that you may use <filename>relay.myISP.com</filename> as a mail relay.</para>
  
<para>In order to retrieve mail from your mailbox, you'll need to
install a retrieval agent.  <emphasis remap=bf>Fetchmail</emphasis> is a good choice as it
supports many different protocols.  Usually, POP3 will be provided
by your ISP.  If you've chosen to use user-ppp, you can automatically
fetch your mail when a connection to the 'net is established with the
following entry in <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</filename>:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        MYADDR:
          !bg su user -c fetchmail
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>If you are using <emphasis remap=tt>sendmail</emphasis> (as shown below) to deliver mail to
non-local accounts, put the command</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>	  !bg su user -c "sendmail -q"
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>after the above shown entry. This forces sendmail to process your
mailqueue as soon as the connection to the 'net is established.</para>
  
<para>I'm assuming that you have an account for <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis> on <filename>bsd.home</filename>.
In the home directory of <emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis> on <filename>bsd.home</filename>, create a

<para>
<literallayout>        poll myISP.com protocol pop3 fetchall pass MySecret;
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Needless to say, this file should not be readable by anyone except
<emphasis remap=tt>user</emphasis> as it contains the password <emphasis remap=tt>MySecret</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>In order to send mail with the correct <emphasis remap=bf>from:</emphasis> header, you must
tell sendmail to use <email>user@myISP.com</email> rather than
<email>user@bsd.home</email>.  You may also wish to tell sendmail to send all
mail via <filename>relay.myISP.com</filename>, allowing quicker mail transmission.</para>
  
<para>The following <filename>.mc</filename> file should suffice:</para>

<para>The most common way to accomplish this is to build a

<para>A UNIX process is owned by a patricular userid.  If the

<para>Why doesn't my mouse work with X</para></question><answer>

<para>If you are using syscons (the default console driver), you can
configure FreeBSD to support a mouse pointer on each virtual
screen.  In order to avoid conflicting with X, syscons supports
a virtual device called ``<filename>/dev/sysmouse</filename>''.  All mouse events
received from the real mouse device are written to the sysmouse
device, using the MouseSystems protocol.  If you wish to use your
mouse on one or more virtual consoles, <emphasis remap=bf>and</emphasis> use X, the
following configuration is recommended:</para>
  
<para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>What is a virtual console and how do I make more?</para></question><answer>

<para>Virtual consoles, put simply, enable you to have several
simultaneous sessions on the same machine without doing anything
complicated like setting up a network or running X.</para>
  
<para>When the system starts, it will display a login prompt on
the monitor after displaying all the boot messages. You can
then type in your login name and password and start working (or
playing!) on the first virtual console.</para>
  
<para>At some point, you will probably wish to start another
session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program
you are running or to read your mail while waiting for an
FTP transfer to finish. Just do Alt-F2 (hold down the Alt
key and press the F2 key), and you will find a login prompt
waiting for you on the second ``virtual console''! When you
want to go back to the original session, do Alt-F1.</para>
  
<para>The default FreeBSD installation has three virtual consoles
enabled (8 starting with 3.3-RELEASE), and Alt-F1, Alt-F2, and
Alt-F3 will switch between these virtual consoles.</para>
  
<para>To enable more of them, edit <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink>
and add entries for ``<emphasis remap=tt>ttyv4</emphasis>'' to ``<emphasis remap=tt>ttyvc</emphasis>'' after the
comment on ``Virtual terminals'':</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        # Edit the existing entry for ttyv3 in /etc/ttys and change
        # "off" to "on".
        ttyv3   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
        ttyv4   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure

        ttyv7   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
        ttyv8   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure

        ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Use as many or as few as you want.  The more virtual terminals
you have, the more resources that are used; this can be important
if you have 8MB RAM or less.  You may also want to change the
``<emphasis remap=tt>secure</emphasis>'' to ``<emphasis remap=tt>insecure</emphasis>''.</para>
  
<para><emphasis remap=bf>IMPORTANT NOTE</emphasis> if you want to run an X server you <acronym>MUST</acronym>
leave at least one virtual terminal unused (or turned off) for it
to use.  That is to say that if you want to have a login
prompt pop up for all twelve of your Alt-function keys,
you're out of luck - you can only do this for eleven of them
if you also want to run an X server on the same machine.</para>
  
<para>The easiest way to disable a console is by turning it off.  For
example, if you had the full 12 terminal allocation mentioned
above and you wanted to run X, you would change settings for
virtual terminal 12 from:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
      </literallayout>

<para>to:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>If your keyboard has only ten function keys, you would end up with:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
        ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
        ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>(You could also just delete these lines.)</para>
  
<para>Once you have edited <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink>,
the next step is to make sure that you have enough virtual terminal
devices.  The easiest way to do this is:</para>

<literallayout>        # cd /dev
        # ./MAKEDEV vty12                 # For 12 devices
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Next, the easiest (and cleanest) way to activate the virtual
consoles is to reboot.  However, if you really don't want to
reboot, you can just shut down the X Window system and execute (as
<emphasis remap=tt>root</emphasis>):</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        kill -HUP 1
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>It's imperative that you completely shut down X Window if it is
running, before running this command.  If you don't, your system
will probably appear to hang/lock up after executing the kill
command.</para>

<para>If the console is currently displaying X Window, you can use

that once you've switched away from X Window to a virtual

virtual terminal or back to X Window.  You do not need to also press the
Ctrl key.  If you use the control key to switch back to X on some

<para>How do I start XDM on boot?</para></question><answer>

<para>There are two schools of thought on how to start <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?manpath=xfree86&amp;query=xdm">xdm</ulink>.  One school starts xdm from
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink> using the supplied example, while the other
simply runs xdm from <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc">rc.local</ulink> or 
from a <filename>X.sh</filename> script in <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename>.
Both are equally valid, and one may work in 
situations where the other doesn't. In both cases the result is the
same: X will popup a graphical login: prompt. </para>
  
<para>The ttys method has the advantage
of documenting which vty X will start on and passing the responsibility
of restarting the X server on logout to init.  The rc.local method
makes it easy to kill xdm if there is a problem starting the X server. </para>
  
<para>If loaded from rc.local, <emphasis remap=tt>xdm</emphasis> should be started without any 
arguments (i.e., as a daemon).  xdm must start AFTER getty runs, or 
else getty and xdm will conflict, locking out the console.  The best 
way around this is to have the script sleep 10 seconds or so then
launch xdm.</para>
  
<para>A previous version of the FAQ said to add the
<emphasis remap=tt>vt</emphasis> you want X to use to the
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</filename> file.  This is not necessary:
X will use the first free <emphasis remap=tt>vt</emphasis> it finds.</para>

<para>This is because of the way console permissions are set by default.

<para>My PS/2 mouse doesn't behave properly under X.</para></question><answer>

<para>Your mouse and the mouse driver may have somewhat become out of
synchronization.</para>
  
<para>In versions 2.2.5 and earlier, switching away from X to a

device attached to the PS/2 mouse port.</para>
  
<para>In versions 2.2.6 and later, synchronization check is done
in a slightly better way and is standard in the PS/2 mouse driver.
It should even work with GlidePoint.  (As the check code has become
a standard feature, PSM_CHECKSYNC option is not available in these
versions.)  However, in rare case the driver may erroneously report
synchronization problem and you may see the kernel message:</para>

<para>How do I install a splash screen and where do I find them?
    </para></question><answer>

<para>Just prior to the release of FreeBSD 3.1, a new feature was
added to allow the display of &quot;splash&quot; screens during
the boot messages. The splash screens currently must be a 256
color bitmap (<filename>*.BMP</filename>) or ZSoft PCX
(<filename>*.PCX</filename>) file.  In addition, they must have a
resolution of 320x200 or less to work on standard VGA adapters.
If you compile VESA support into your kernel, then you can use
larger bitmaps up to 1024x768. Note that VESA support requires
the <emphasis remap=tt>VM86</emphasis> kernel option to be compiled into the
kernel.  The actual VESA support can either be compiled directly
into the kernel with the <acronym>VESA</acronym> kernel config option
or by loading the VESA kld module during bootup.</para>
  
<para>To use a splash screen, you need to modify the startup files
that control the boot process for FreeBSD.  The files for this
changed prior to the release of FreeBSD 3.2, so there are now
two ways of loading a splash screen:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>FreeBSD 3.1

</para>

<para>The first step is to find a bitmap version of your splash
screen.  Release 3.1 only supports Windows bitmap splash
screens.  Once you've found your splash screen of choice
copy it to <filename>/boot/splash.bmp</filename>.  Next, you need to
have a <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> file that contains the
following lines:</para>

<para>
<literallayout>           load kernel
           load -t splash_image_data /boot/splash.bmp
           load splash_bmp
           autoboot
       </literallayout>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>FreeBSD 3.2+

</para>

<para>In addition to adding support for PCX splash screens,
FreeBSD 3.2 includes a nicer way of configuring the boot
process.  If you wish, you can use the method listed above
for FreeBSD 3.1.  If you do and you want to use PCX, replace
<symbol>splash_bmp</symbol> with <symbol>splash_pcx</symbol>.  If,
on the other hand, you want to use the newer boot
configuration, you need to create a
<filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> file that contains the
following lines:</para>

<para>
<literallayout>           include /boot/loader.4th
           start
       </literallayout>
</para>

<para></para>

<para>and a <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> that contains the
following:</para>

<para>
<literallayout>           splash_bmp_load="YES"
           bitmap_load="YES"
       </literallayout>
</para>

<para></para>

<para>This assumes you are using <filename>/boot/splash.bmp</filename>
for your splash screen.  If you'd rather use a PCX file,
copy it to <filename>/boot/splash.pcx</filename>, create a
<filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename> as instructed above, and
create a <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> that contains:</para>

<para>Where can I get information on ``diskless booting''?</para></question><answer>

<para>``Diskless booting'' means that the FreeBSD box is booted over a
network, and reads the necessary files from a server instead of
its hard disk. For full details, please read

<qandaentry><question>
<para>        Can a FreeBSD box be used as a dedicated network router?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>Internet standards and good engineering practice prohibit us from
providing packet forwarding by default in FreeBSD. You can
however enable this feature by changing the following variable to
<acronym>YES</acronym> in <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf">rc.conf</ulink>:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        gateway_enable=YES          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This option will put the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sysctl">sysctl</ulink> variable
<filename>net.inet.ip.forwarding</filename> to <emphasis remap=tt>1</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>In most cases, you will also need to run a routing process to
tell other systems on your network about your router; FreeBSD
comes with the standard BSD routing daemon 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?routed">routed</ulink>, or for more complex situations you may want to try
<emphasis>GaTeD</emphasis> (available from <ulink URL="http://www.gated.org/"> http://www.gated.org/ </ulink>) which
supports FreeBSD as of 3_5Alpha7.</para>
  
<para>It is our duty to warn you that, even when FreeBSD is configured
in this way, it does not completely comply with the Internet
standard requirements for routers; however, it comes close enough
for ordinary usage.</para>

<para>Can I connect my Win95 box to the Internet via FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>Typically, people who ask this question have two PC's at home, one
with FreeBSD and one with Win95; the idea is to use the FreeBSD
box to connect to the Internet and then be able to access the
Internet from the Windows95 box through the FreeBSD box. This
is really just a special case of the previous question.</para>

FreeBSD up as a <ulink URL="http://www.ssimicro.com/~jeremyc/ppp.html">PPP Dialup Router</ulink></para>
  
<para><emphasis remap=bf>NOTE:</emphasis> This requires having at least two fixed IP addresses
available, and possibly three or more, depending on how much
work you want to go through to set up the Windows box. As an
alternative, if you don't have a fixed IP, you can use one of
the private IP subnets and install <emphasis remap=bf>proxies</emphasis> such as

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?</para></question><answer>

<para>You will probably find that the host is actually in a different
domain; for example, if you are in foo.bar.edu and you wish to reach
a host called ``mumble'' in the bar.edu domain, you will have to
refer to it by the fully-qualified domain name, ``mumble.bar.edu'',
instead of just ``mumble''.</para>
  
<para>Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers. However
the current version of <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?named">bind</ulink> that ships
with FreeBSD no longer provides default abbreviations for non-fully
qualified domain names other than the domain you are in.
So an unqualified host <emphasis remap=tt>mumble</emphasis> must either be found
as <filename>mumble.foo.bar.edu</filename>, or it will be searched for
in the root domain.</para>
  
<para>This is different from the previous behavior, where the
search continued across <filename>mumble.bar.edu</filename>, and
<filename>mumble.edu</filename>.  Have a look at RFC 1535 for why this
was considered bad practice, or even a security hole.</para>
  
<para>As a good workaround, you can place the line</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        search foo.bar.edu bar.edu
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>instead of the previous</para>

      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>into your <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</ulink> file.  However, make sure that the search order
does not go beyond the ``boundary between local and public
administration'', as RFC 1535 calls it.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>How much overhead does IPFW incur?</para></question><answer>

<para>The answer to this depends mostly on your rule set and processor
speed.  For most applications dealing with ethernet and small
rule sets, the answer is, negligible.  For those of you that need
actual measurements to satisfy your curiosity, read on.</para>
  
<para>The following measurements were made using 2.2.5-STABLE on
a 486-66.  IPFW was modified to measure the time spent within
the <symbol>ip_fw_chk</symbol> routine, displaying the results to the console
every 1000 packets.</para>
  
<para>Two rule sets, each with 1000 rules were tested.  The first set
was designed to demonstrate a worst case scenario by repeating the
rule:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ipfw add deny tcp from any to any 55555
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This demonstrates worst case by causing most of IPFW's packet
check routine to be executed before finally deciding that the
packet does not match the rule (by virtue of the port number).
Following the 999th iteration of this rule was an <emphasis remap=tt>allow ip
from any to any</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>The second set of rules were designed to abort the rule
check quickly:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ipfw add deny ip from 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.4
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>The nonmatching source IP address for the above rule causes
these rules to be skipped very quickly.  As before, the 1000th
rule was an <emphasis remap=tt>allow ip from any to any</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>The per-packet processing overhead in the former case was
approximately 2.703ms/packet, or roughly 2.7 microseconds per
rule.  Thus the theoretical packet processing limit with these
rules is around 370 packets per second.  Assuming 10Mbps ethernet
and a ~1500 byte packet size, we would only be able to achieve a
55.5% bandwidth utilization.</para>
  
<para>For the latter case each packet was processed in
approximately 1.172ms, or roughly 1.2 microseconds per rule.
The theoretical packet processing limit here would be about
853 packets per second, which could consume 10Mbps ethernet
bandwidth.</para>
  
<para>The excessive number of rules tested and the nature of those
rules do not provide a real-world scenario -- they were used only
to generate the timing information presented here.  Here are a
few things to keep in mind when building an efficient rule set:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Place an `established' rule early on to handle the
majority of TCP traffic.  Don't put any <emphasis remap=tt>allow tcp</emphasis>
statements before this rule.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Place heavily triggered rules earlier in the rule
set than those rarely used (<emphasis remap=bf>without changing the
permissiveness of the firewall</emphasis>, of course).  You can see
which rules are used most often by examining the packet counting
statistics with <command>ipfw -a l</command>.

</para>
  
<para>This is assuming that you've used the addresses from the

<para>My connection hangs after a random amount of time</para></question><answer>

<para>Many people experience hung connections with no apparent
explaination.  The first thing to establish is which side of the
link is hung.</para>
  
<para>If you are using an external modem, you can simply try using
<emphasis remap=tt>ping</emphasis> to see if the <acronym>TD</acronym> light is flashing when you
transmit data.  If it flashes (and the <acronym>RD</acronym> light doesn't), the
problem is with the remote end.  If <acronym>TD</acronym> doesn't flash, the problem
is local.  With an internal modem, you'll need to use the <emphasis remap=tt>set
server</emphasis> command in your <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file.  When the hang occurs,
connect to ppp using pppctl.  If your network connection suddenly
revives (ppp was revived due to the activity on the diagnostic socket)
or if you can't connect (assuming the <emphasis remap=tt>set socket</emphasis> command
succeeded at startup time), the problem is local.  If you can connect
and things are still hung, enable local async logging with <emphasis remap=tt>set log
local async</emphasis> and use <emphasis remap=tt>ping</emphasis> from another window or terminal to make
use of the link.  The async logging will show you the data being
transmitted and received on the link.  If data is going out and not
coming back, the problem is remote.</para>
  
<para>Having established whether the problem is local or remote,
you now have two possibilities:</para>

<para>The remote end isn't responding</para></question><answer>

<para>There's very little you can do about this.  Most ISPs will
refuse to help if you're not running a Microsoft OS.  You can
<emphasis remap=tt>enable lqr</emphasis> in your <filename>ppp.conf</filename> file, allowing ppp to
detect the remote failure and hang up, but this detection is
relatively slow and therefore not that useful.  You may want
to avoid telling your ISP that you're running user-ppp....</para>
  
<para>First, try disabling all local compression by adding the
following to your configuration:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>            disable pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
            deny pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
          </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Then reconnect to ensure that this makes no difference.
If things improve or if the problem is solved completely,
determine which setting makes the difference through trial
and error.  This will provide good amunition when you contact
your ISP (although it may make it apparent that you're not
running a Microsoft product).</para>
  
<para>Before contacting your ISP, enable async logging locally
and wait until the connection hangs again.  This may use up
quite a bit of disk space.  The last data read from the port
may be of interest.  It is usually ascii data, and may even
describe the problem (``Memory fault, core dumped'' ?).</para>
  
<para>If your ISP is helpful, they should be able to enable logging
on their end, then when the next link drop occurs, they may be
able to tell you why their side is having a problem.  Feel free

<qandaentry><question>
<para>I keep seeing errors about magic being the same</para></question><answer>

<para>Occasionally, just after connecting, you may see messages in
the log that say "magic is the same".  Sometimes, these
messages are harmless, and sometimes one side or the other
exits.  Most ppp implementations cannot survive this problem, and
even if the link seems to come up, you'll see repeated configure
requests and configure acknowledgements in the log file until
ppp eventually gives up and closes the connection.</para>
  
<para>This normally happens on server machines with slow disks that
are spawning a getty on the port, and executing ppp from a
login script or program after login.  I've also heard reports
of it happening consistently when using slirp.  The reason is
that in the time taken between getty exiting and ppp starting, the
client-side ppp starts sending Line Control Protocol (LCP)
packets.  Because ECHO is still switched on for the port on
the server, the client ppp sees these packets "reflect" back.</para>
  
<para>One part of the LCP negotiation is to establish a magic number
for each side of the link so that "reflections" can be detected.
The protocol says that when the peer tries to negotiate
the same magic number, a NAK should be sent and a new magic
number should be chosen.  During the period that the server
port has ECHO turned on, the client ppp sends LCP packets,
sees the same magic in the reflected packet and NAKs it.  It
also sees the NAK reflect (which also means ppp must change
its magic).  This produces a potentially enormous number of
magic number changes, all of which are happily piling into
the server's tty buffer.  As soon as ppp starts on the server,
it's flooded with magic number changes and almost immediately
decides it's tried enough to negotiate LCP and gives up.
Meanwhile, the client, who no longer sees the reflections,
becomes happy just in time to see a hangup from the server.</para>
  
<para>This can be avoided by allowing the peer to start negotiating
with the following line in your ppp.conf file:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>          set openmode passive
        </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This tells ppp to wait for the server to initiate LCP
negotiations.  Some servers however may never initiate negotiations.
If this is the case, you can do something like:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>          set openmode active 3
        </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This tells ppp to be passive for 3 seconds, and then to start
sending LCP requests.  If the peer starts sending requests during
this period, ppp will immediately respond rather than waiting for
the full 3 second period.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>          LCP negotiations continue 'till the connection is closed
        </para></question><answer>

<para>There is currently an implementation mis-feature in <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>
where it doesn't associate LCP, CCP &amp; IPCP responses with
their original requests.  As a result, if one <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>
implementation is more than 6 seconds slower than the other side,
the other side will send two additional LCP configuration requests.
This is fatal.</para>
  
<para>Consider two implementations, <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> and <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis>.  <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> starts
sending LCP requests immediately after connecting and <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> takes
7 seconds to start.  When <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> starts, <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> has sent 3 LCP
REQs.  We're assuming the line has ECHO switched off, otherwise
we'd see magic number problems as described in the previous section.
<emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> sends a REQ, then an ACK to the first of <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis>'s REQs.
This results in <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> entering the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state and sending
and ACK (the first) back to <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis>.  In the meantime, <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> sends
back two more ACKs in response to the two additional REQs sent by
<emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> before <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> started up.  <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> then receives the first
ACK from <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> and enters the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.  <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> receives
the second ACK from <emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> and goes back to the <emphasis remap=bf>REQ-SENT</emphasis> state,
sending another (forth) REQ as per the RFC.  It then receives the
third ACK and enters the <acronym>OPENED</acronym> state.  In the meantime,
<emphasis remap=bf>B</emphasis> receives the forth REQ from <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis>, resulting in it reverting
to the <emphasis remap=bf>ACK-SENT</emphasis> state and sending another (second) REQ and
(forth) ACK as per the RFC.  <emphasis remap=bf>A</emphasis> gets the REQ, goes into
<emphasis remap=bf>REQ-SENT</emphasis> and sends another REQ.  It immediately receives the
following ACK and enters <acronym>OPENED</acronym>.</para>
  
<para>This goes on 'till one side figures out that they're getting
nowhere and gives up.</para>
  
<para>The best way to avoid this is to configure one side to be
<emphasis remap=bf>passive</emphasis> - that is, make one side wait for the other to start
negotiating.  This can be done with the</para>

<para>Why does ppp dial for no reason in -auto mode</para></question><answer>

<para>If <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> is dialing unexpectedly, you must determine the

<para>To determine the cause, use the following line:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>          set log +tcp/ip
        </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This will log all traffic through the connection.  The next
time the line comes up unexpectedly, you will see the reason
logged with a convenient timestamp next to it.</para>
  
<para>You can now disable dialing under these circumstances.  Usually,
this sort of problem arises due to DNS lookups.  To prevent
DNS lookups from establishing a connection (this will <emphasis remap=bf>not</emphasis>
prevent <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> from passing the packets through an established
connection), use the following:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>          set dfilter 1 deny udp src eq 53
          set dfilter 2 deny udp dst eq 53
          set dfilter 3 permit 0/0 0/0
        </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This is not always suitable, as it will effectively break your
demand-dial capabilities - most programs will need a DNS lookup
before doing any other network related things.</para>
  
<para>In the DNS case, you should try to determine what is actually
trying to resolve a host name.  A lot of the time, 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sendmail">sendmail</ulink> is the culprit.  You should make sure that you tell
sendmail not to do any DNS lookups in its configuration file.  See
the section on <link linkend="ispmail">Mail Configuration</link> for

go into it.  You may also want to add the following line to your

<literallayout>          define(`confDELIVERY_MODE', `d')dnl

</para>
  
<para>This will make sendmail queue everything until the queue is

<para>This was a known problem with <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> set up to negotiate
a dynamic local IP number with the peer in auto mode.  It is
fixed in the latest version - search the man page for <emphasis remap=bf>iface</emphasis>.</para>
  
<para>The problem was that when that initial program calls
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?connect">connect(2)</ulink>, the IP number of the tun interface is
assigned to the socket endpoint.  The kernel creates the first
outgoing packet and writes it to the tun device.  <emphasis remap=bf>Ppp</emphasis> then
reads the packet and establishes a connection.  If, as a result
of <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis>s dynamic IP assignment, the interface address is changed,
the original socket endpoint will be invalid.  Any subsequent
packets sent to the peer will usually be dropped.  Even if
they aren't, any responses will not route back to the originating
machine as the IP number is no longer owned by that machine.</para>
  
<para>There are several theoretical ways to approach this problem.
It would be nicest if the peer would re-assign the same IP number
if possible <emphasis remap=tt>:-)</emphasis>  The current version of <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> does this,
but most other implementations don't.</para>
  
<para>The easiest method from our side would be to never change the
tun interface IP number, but instead to change all outgoing packets
so that the source IP number is changed from the interface IP to
the negotiated IP on the fly.  This is essentially what the
<emphasis remap=tt>iface-alias</emphasis> option in the latest version of <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> is
doing (with the help of <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?libalias">libalias(3)</ulink>
and ppp's <option>-alias</option> switch) - it's maintaining all previous
interface addresses and aliasing them to the last negotiated address.</para>
  
<para>Another alternative (and probably the most reliable) would be
to implement a system call that changes all bound sockets from one
IP to another.  <emphasis remap=bf>Ppp</emphasis> would use this call to modify the
sockets of all existing programs when a new IP number is
negotiated.  The same system call could be used by dhcp clients
when they are forced to re-bind() their sockets.</para>
  
<para>Yet another possibility is to allow an interface to be brought
up without an IP number.  Outgoing packets would be given
an IP number of 255.255.255.255 up until the first SIOCAIFADDR
ioctl is done.  This would result in fully binding the socket.  It
would be up to <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> to change the source IP number, but only if
it's set to 255.255.255.255, and only the IP number and IP checksum
would need to change.  This, however is a bit of a hack as
the kernel would be sending bad packets to an improperly
configured interface, on the assumption that some other mechanism
is capable of fixing things retrospectively.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Why don't most games work with the -alias switch</para></question><answer>

<para>The reason games and the like don't work when libalias is
in use is that the machine on the outside will try to open a
connection or send (unsolicited) UDP packets to the machine
on the inside.  The packet alias software doesn't know that
it should send these packets to the interior machine.</para>
  
<para>To make things work, make sure that the only thing running
is the software that you're having problems with, then either
run tcpdump on the tun interface of the gateway or enable ppp
tcp/ip logging (``set log +tcp/ip'') on the gateway.</para>
  
<para>When you start the offending software, you should see packets
passing through the gateway machine.  When something comes back
from the outside, it'll be dropped (that's the problem).  Note
the port number of these packets then shut down the offending
software.  Do this a few times to see if the port numbers are
consistent.  If they are, then the following line in the relevant
section of /etc/ppp/ppp.conf will make the software functional:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>          alias port proto internalmachine:port port
        </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>where ``proto'' is either ``tcp'' or ``udp'',
``internalmachine'' is the machine that you want the packets
to be sent to and ``port'' is the destination port number of
the packets.</para>
  
<para>You won't be able to use the software on other machines
without changing the above command, and running the software
on two internal machines at the same time is out of the question
- after all, the outside world is seeing your entire internal
network as being just a single machine.</para>
  
<para>If the port numbers aren't consistent, there are three more
options:</para>
  
<para><emphasis remap=bf>1)</emphasis> Submit support in libalias.  Examples of ``special
cases'' can be found in /usr/src/lib/libalias/alias_*.c (alias_ftp.c
is a good prototype).  This usually involves reading certain
recognised outgoing packets, identifying the instruction that
tells the outside machine to initiate a connection back to the
internal machine on a specific (random) port and setting up a
``route'' in the alias table so that the subsequent packets
know where to go.</para>
  
<para>This is the most difficult solution, but it is the best and
will make the software work with multiple machines.</para>
  
<para><emphasis remap=bf>2)</emphasis> Use a proxy.  The application may support socks5
for example, or (as in the ``cvsup'' case) may have a ``passive''
option that avoids ever requesting that the peer open connections
back to the local machine.</para>
  
<para><emphasis remap=bf>3)</emphasis> Redirect everything to the internal machine using
``alias addr''.  This is the sledge-hammer approach.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>What are FCS errors ?</para></question><answer>

<para>FCS stands for <emphasis remap=bf>F</emphasis>rame <emphasis remap=bf>C</emphasis>heck <emphasis remap=bf>S</emphasis>equence.  Each
ppp packet has a checksum attached to ensure that the data
being received is the data being sent.  If the FCS of an
incoming packet is incorrect, the packet is dropped and the
HDLC FCS count is increased.  The HDLC error values can be
displayed using the <emphasis remap=tt>show hdlc</emphasis> command.</para>
  
<para>If your link is bad (or if your serial driver is dropping
packets), you will see the occasional FCS error.  This is not
usually worth worrying about although it does slow down the
compression protocols substantially.  If you have an external
modem, make sure your cable is properly shielded from
interference - this may eradicate the problem.</para>
  
<para>If your link freezes as soon as you've connected and you see
a large number of FCS errors, this may be because your link is
not 8 bit clean.  Make sure your modem is not using software
flow control (XON/XOFF).  If your datalink <emphasis remap=bf>must</emphasis> use
software flow control, use the command
<literal>set accmap 0x000a0000</literal> to tell <emphasis remap=bf>ppp</emphasis> to escape
the ^Q and ^S characters.</para>
  
<para>Another reason for seeing too many FCS errors may be that
the remote end has stopped talking <acronym>PPP</acronym>.  You may want to
enable <emphasis remap=tt>async</emphasis> logging at this point to determine if the
incoming data is actually a login or shell prompt.  If you
have a shell prompt at the remote end, it's possible to
terminate ppp without dropping the line by using the
<emphasis remap=tt>close lcp</emphasis> command (a following <emphasis remap=tt>term</emphasis> command
will reconnect you to the shell on the remote machine.</para>
  
<para>If nothing in your log file indicates why the link might
have been terminated, you should ask the remote administrator
(your ISP?) why the session was terminated.</para>

<qandaset><qandaentry><question>
<para>How do I tell if FreeBSD found my serial ports?</para></question><answer>

<para>As the FreeBSD kernel boots, it will probe for the serial ports
in your system for which the kernel was configured.  You can
either watch your system closely for the messages it prints or
run the command</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        dmesg | grep sio
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>after your system's up and running.</para>
  
<para>Here's some example output from the above command:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
        sio0: type 16550A
        sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
        sio1: type 16550A
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This shows two serial ports.  The first is on irq 4, is using
port address <literal>0x3f8</literal>, and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The
second uses the same kind of chip but is on irq 3 and is at port
address <literal>0x2f8</literal>.  Internal modem cards are treated just like
serial ports---except that they always have a modem ``attached''
to the port.</para>
  
<para>The <acronym>GENERIC</acronym> kernel includes support for two serial ports
using the same irq and port address settings in the above
example.  If these settings aren't right for your system, or if
you've added modem cards or have more serial ports than your
kernel is configured for, just reconfigure your kernel.  See
section <link linkend="make-kernel">about building a kernel</link> for
more details.</para>

<para>How do I access the serial ports on FreeBSD?</para></question><answer>

<para>The third serial port, <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio">sio2</ulink> (known as
COM3 in DOS), is on <filename>/dev/cuaa2</filename> for dial-out devices, and on
<filename>/dev/ttyd2</filename> for dial-in devices.  What's the difference
between these two classes of devices?</para>
  
<para>You use <emphasis remap=tt>ttydX</emphasis> for dial-ins.  When opening <filename>/dev/ttydX</filename>
in blocking mode, a process will wait for the corresponding
<emphasis remap=tt>cuaaX</emphasis> device to become inactive, and then wait
for the carrier detect line to go active.  When you open the
<emphasis remap=tt>cuaaX</emphasis> device, it makes sure the serial port isn't already in
use by the <emphasis remap=tt>ttydX</emphasis> device.  If the port's available, it
``steals'' it from the <emphasis remap=tt>ttydX</emphasis> device.  Also, the <emphasis remap=tt>cuaXX</emphasis>
device doesn't care about carrier detect.  With this scheme and
an auto-answer modem, you can have remote users log in and you
can still dialout with the same modem and the system will take
care of all the conflicts.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>How do I enable support for a multiport serial card?</para></question><answer>

<para>Again, the section on kernel configuration provides information
about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport serial card,
place an <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?sio">sio</ulink> line for each serial port on the card in the
kernel configuration file.  But place the irq and vector
specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports on the
card should share one irq.  For consistency, use the last serial
port to specify the irq.  Also, specify the <symbol>COM_MULTIPORT</symbol>
option.</para>
  
<para>The following example is for an AST 4-port serial card on irq 7:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        options "COM_MULTIPORT"
        device sio4 at isa? port 0x2a0 tty flags 0x781
        device sio5 at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x781
        device sio6 at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x781
        device sio7 at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x781 irq 7 vector siointr
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>The flags indicate that the master port has minor number 7
(<literal>0x700</literal>), diagnostics enabled during probe (<literal>0x080</literal>), and
all the ports share an irq (<literal>0x001</literal>).</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>

<para>Not yet. You'll have to use a different irq for each card.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Can I set the default serial parameters for a port?</para></question><answer>

<para>The <emphasis remap=tt>ttydX</emphasis> (or <emphasis remap=tt>cuaaX</emphasis>) device is the regular device
you'll want to open for your applications.  When a process opens
the device, it'll have a default set of terminal I/O settings.
You can see these settings with the command</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in
effect until the device is closed.  When it's reopened, it goes
back to the default set.  To make changes to the default set, you
can open and adjust the settings of the ``initial state'' device.
For example, to turn on <acronym>CLOCAL</acronym> mode, 8 bits, and
<filename>XON/XOFF</filename> flow control by default for ttyd5, do:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>A good place to do this is in <filename>/etc/rc.serial</filename>. Now, an
application will have these settings by default when it opens
<emphasis remap=tt>ttyd5</emphasis>.  It can still change these settings to its liking,
though.</para>
  
<para>You can also prevent certain settings from being changed by an
application by making adjustments to the ``lock state'' device.
For example, to lock the speed of <emphasis remap=tt>ttyd5</emphasis> to 57600 bps, do</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Now, an application that opens <emphasis remap=tt>ttyd5</emphasis> and tries to change the
speed of the port will be stuck with 57600 bps.</para>
  
<para>Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state
devices writable only by <emphasis remap=tt>root</emphasis>. The <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</ulink> script does <acronym>NOT</acronym> do this when it creates the
device entries.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>How can I enable dialup logins on my modem?</para></question><answer>

<para>So you want to become an Internet service provider, eh?  First,
you'll need one or more modems that can auto-answer.  Your modem
will need to assert carrier-detect when it detects a carrier and
not assert it all the time.  It will need to hang up the phone
and reset itself when the data terminal ready (<acronym>DTR</acronym>) line
goes from on to off.  It should probably use <filename>RTS/CTS</filename>
flow control or no local flow control at all.  Finally, it must
use a constant speed between the computer and itself, but (to be
nice to your callers) it should negotiate a speed between itself
and the remote modem.</para>
  
<para>For many Hayes command-set--compatible modems, this command will
make these settings and store them in nonvolatile memory:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        AT &amp;C1 &amp;D3 &amp;K3 &amp;Q6 S0=1 &amp;W
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>See the section <link linkend="direct-at">on sending AT commands</link> below for information on how to make these settings
without resorting to an MS-DOS terminal program.</para>
  
<para>Next, make an entry in <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink> for the
modem.  This file lists all the ports on which the operating system will
await logins.  Add a line that looks something like this:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.57600" dialup on insecure
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This line indicates that the second serial port
(<filename>/dev/ttyd1</filename>) has a modem connected running at 57600 bps
and no parity (<emphasis remap=tt>std.57600</emphasis>, which comes from the file
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?gettytab">/etc/gettytab</ulink>). The terminal type for this port is
``dialup.''  The port is ``on'' and is ``insecure''---meaning
root logins on the port aren't allowed.  For dialin ports like
this one, use the <emphasis remap=tt>ttydX</emphasis> entry.</para>
  
<para>It's common practice to use ``dialup'' as the terminal type.
Many users set up in their .profile or .login files a prompt for
the actual terminal type if the starting type is dialup.  The
example shows the port as insecure.  To become root on this port,
you have to login as a regular user, then ``<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?su">su</ulink>'' to
<emphasis remap=tt>root</emphasis>.  If you use ``secure'' then <emphasis remap=tt>root</emphasis> can login in
directly.</para>
  
<para>After making modifications to <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink>, you
need to send a hangup or <acronym>HUP</acronym> signal to the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?init">init</ulink> process:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        kill -HUP 1
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>This forces the init process to reread <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ttys">/etc/ttys</ulink>.  The
init process will then start getty processes on all ``on'' ports.
You can find out if logins are available for your port by typing</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        ps -ax | grep '[t]tyd1'
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>You should see something like:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        747 ??  I      0:00.04 /usr/libexec/getty std.57600 ttyd1

<emphasis remap=tt>NO DIALTONE</emphasis>, or <emphasis remap=tt>CONNECT 115200</emphasis> will just confuse it.
You should turn those messages off when you use <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?tip">tip</ulink> (using

<para>Also, the dial timeout for <emphasis remap=tt>tip</emphasis> is 60 seconds.  Your modem

<para>Why do I have to hit CTRL+P twice to send CTRL+P once?</para></question><answer>

<para>CTRL+P is the default ``force'' character, used to tell

means ``set a variable.''</para>
  
<para>Type ``<literal>~sforce=&lt;single-char&gt;</literal>'' followed by a newline.
<emphasis remap=tt>&lt;single-char&gt;</emphasis> is any single character.  If you leave
out <emphasis remap=tt>&lt;single-char&gt;</emphasis>, then the force character is the nul

pretty good value for <emphasis remap=tt>&lt;single-char&gt;</emphasis> is SHIFT+CTRL+6,
which I've seen only used on some terminal servers.</para>

<qandaset><qandaentry><question>
<para>        FreeBSD uses far more swap space than Linux. Why?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>FreeBSD only appears to use more swap than Linux.  In actual fact,
it does not.  The main difference between FreeBSD and Linux in this
regard is that FreeBSD will proactively move entirely idle, unused pages
of main memory into swap in order to make more main memory available 
for active use.  Linux tends to only move pages to swap as a last resort.
The perceived heavier use of swap is balanced by the more efficient use
of main memory. </para>
  
<para>Note that while FreeBSD is proactive in this regard, it does not 
arbitrarily decide to swap pages when the system is truely idle.  Thus
you will not find your system all paged out when you get up in the
morning after leaving it idle overnight.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>        Why use (what are) a.out and ELF executable formats?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>To understand why FreeBSD uses the <filename>a.out</filename> format, you must
first know a little about the 3 currently "dominant" executable
formats for UNIX:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para><ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?a.out(5)">a.out</ulink>

</para>

<para>The oldest and `classic' unix object format.  It uses a
short and compact header with a magic number at the beginning
that's often used to characterize the format (see
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?a.out(5)">a.out(5)</ulink> for more details).  It contains three loaded
segments: .text, .data, and .bss plus a symbol table and a
string table.</para>

<para></para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><acronym>COFF</acronym>
</para>

<para>The SVR3 object format.  The header now comprises a section
table, so you can have more than just .text, .data, and .bss
sections.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><acronym>ELF</acronym>
</para>

<para>The successor to <acronym>COFF</acronym>, featuring Multiple sections
and 32-bit or 64-bit possible values.  One major drawback:
<acronym>ELF</acronym> was also designed with the assumption that there
would be only one ABI per system architecture.  That
assumption is actually quite incorrect, and not even in the
commercial SYSV world (which has at least three ABIs: SVR4,
Solaris, SCO) does it hold true.</para>

<para></para>

<para>FreeBSD tries to work around this problem somewhat by
providing a utility for <emphasis>branding</emphasis> a known <acronym>ELF</acronym>
executable with information about the ABI it's compliant with.
See the man page for 
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?brandelf">brandelf</ulink> for more information.</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
  
<para>FreeBSD comes from the "classic" camp and has traditionally used
the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?a.out(5)">a.out</ulink> format, a technology tried and proven through
many generations of BSD releases.  Though it has also been possible
for some time to build and run native <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries (and
kernels) on a FreeBSD system, FreeBSD initially resisted the "push"
to switch to <acronym>ELF</acronym> as the default format.  Why?  Well,
when the Linux camp made their painful transition to <acronym>ELF</acronym>, it
was not so much to flee the <filename>a.out</filename> executable format
as it was their inflexible jump-table based shared library
mechanism, which made the construction of shared libraries
very difficult for vendors and developers alike. Since the <acronym>ELF</acronym>
tools available offered a solution to the shared library
problem and were generally seen as "the way forward" anyway, the
migration cost was accepted as necessary and the transition
made.</para>
  
<para>In FreeBSD's case, our shared
library mechanism is based more closely on Sun's
<emphasis remap=tt>SunOS</emphasis>-style shared library mechanism and, as such, is very
easy to use.  
However, starting with 3.0, FreeBSD officially supports <acronym>ELF</acronym>
binaries as the default format.  Even though the <filename>a.out</filename>
executable format has served us well, the GNU people, who author the
compiler tools we use, have dropped support for the <filename>a.out</filename>
format.  This has forced us to maintain a divergent version of
the compler and linker, and has kept us from reaping the benefits
of the latest GNU development efforts.  Also the demands of
ISO-C++, notably contstructors and destructors, has also led to
native <acronym>ELF</acronym> support in future FreeBSD releases.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Yes, but why are there so many different
      formats?</para></question><answer>

<para>Back in the dim, dark past, there was simple hardware.  This
simple hardware supported a simple, small system.  a.out was
completely adequate for the job of representing binaries on this
simple system (a PDP-11).  As people ported unix from this
simple system, they retained the a.out format because it was
sufficient for the early ports of unix to architectures like the
Motorola 68k, VAXen, etc.</para>
  
<para>Then some bright hardware engineer decided that if he could
force software to do some sleazy tricks, then he'd be able to
shave a few gates off the design and allow his CPU core to run
faster.  While it was made to work with this new kind of
hardware (known these days as RISC), <filename>a.out</filename> was ill-suited
for this hardware, so many formats were developed to get to a
better performance from this hardware than the limited, simple
<filename>a.out</filename> format could offer.  Things like <acronym>COFF</acronym>,
<acronym>ECOFF</acronym>, and a few obscure others were invented and their
limitations explored before things seemed to settle on <acronym>ELF</acronym>.</para>
  
<para>In addition, program sizes were getting huge and disks (and
physical memory) were still relatively small so the concept of a
shared library was born.  The VM system also became more
sophisticated.  While each one of these advancements was done
using the <filename>a.out</filename> format, its usefulness was stretched more
and more with each new feature.  In addition, people wanted to
dynamically load things at run time, or to junk parts of their
program after the init code had run to save in core memory
and/or swap space.  Languages became more sophistocated and
people wanted code called before main automatically.  Lots of
hacks were done to the <filename>a.out</filename> format to allow all of these
things to happen, and they basically worked for a time.  In
time, <filename>a.out</filename> wasn't up to handling all these problems
without an ever increasing overhead in code and complexity.
While <acronym>ELF</acronym> solved many of these problems, it would be
painful to switch from the system that basically worked.  So
<acronym>ELF</acronym> had to wait until it was more painful to remain with
<filename>a.out</filename> than it was to migrate to <acronym>ELF</acronym>.</para>
  
<para>However, as time passed, the build tools that FreeBSD derived
their build tools from (the assembler and loader especially)
evolved in two parallel trees.  The FreeBSD tree added shared
libraries and fixed some bugs.  The GNU folks that originally
write these programs rewrote them and added simpler support for
building cross compilers, plugging in different formats at will,
etc.  Since many people wanted to build cross compilers
targeting FreeBSD, they were out of luck since the older sources
that FreeBSD had for as and ld weren't up to the task.  The new
gnu tools chain (binutils) does support cross compiling,
<acronym>ELF</acronym>, shared libraries, C++ extnensions, etc.  In addition,
many vendors are releasing <acronym>ELF</acronym> binaries, and it is a good
thing for FreeBSD to run them.  And if it is running <acronym>ELF</acronym>
binaries, why bother having <filename>a.out</filename> any more?  It is a tired
old horse that has proven useful for a long time, but it is time
to turn him out to pasture for his long, faithful years of
service.</para>
  
<para><acronym>ELF</acronym> is more expressive than a.out and will allow more
extensibility in the base system.  The <acronym>ELF</acronym> tools are better
maintained, and offer cross compilation support, which is
important to many people.  <acronym>ELF</acronym> may be a little slower than
a.out, but trying to measure it can be difficult.  There are
also numerous details that are different between the two in how
they map pages, handle init code, etc.  None of these are very
important, but they are differences.  In time support for
<filename>a.out</filename> will be moved out of the GENERIC kernel, and
eventually removed from the kernel once the need to run legacy
<filename>a.out</filename> programs is past.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>        Why are login names <emphasis remap=bf>still</emphasis> restricted to 8 characters?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>You'd think it'd be easy enough to change <symbol>UT_NAMESIZE</symbol> and rebuild
the whole world, and everything would just work. Unfortunately there
are often scads of applications and utilities (including system tools)
that have hard-coded small numbers (not always "8" or "9", but oddball
ones like "15" and "20") in structures and buffers.  Not only will
this get you log files which are trashed (due to variable-length
records getting written when fixed records were expected), but it can
break Sun's NIS clients and potentially cause other problems in
interacting with other UNIX systems.</para>
  
<para>In FreeBSD 3.0 and later, the maximum name length has been
increased to 16 characters and those various utilities with
hard-coded name sizes have been found and fixed.  The fact that this
touched so many areas of the system is why, in fact, the change was
not made until 3.0.</para>
  
<para>If you're absolutely confident in your ability to find and fix
these sorts of problems for yourself when and if they pop up, you
can increase the login name length in earlier releases by editing
/usr/include/utmp.h and changing UT_NAMESIZE accordingly.  You must
also update MAXLOGNAME in /usr/include/sys/param.h to match
the UT_NAMESIZE change.  Finally, if you build from sources, don't
forget that /usr/include is updated each time!  Change the appropriate
files in /usr/src/.. instead.</para>

<para>Q. Has anyone done any temperature testing while running FreeBSD?
I know Linux runs cooler than dos, but have never seen a mention of
FreeBSD. It seems to run really hot.</para>
  
<para>A. No, but we have done numerous taste tests on blindfolded
volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of LSD-25
administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers said that FreeBSD
tasted sort of orange, whereas Linux tasted like purple haze.
Neither group mentioned any particular variances in temperature
that I can remember.  We eventually had to throw the results of
this survey out entirely anyway when we found that too many
volunteers were wandering out of the room during the tests, thus
skewing the results.  I think most of the volunteers are at Apple

<para>Seriously, both FreeBSD and Linux use the ``<acronym>HLT</acronym>'' (halt)

<para>Who's scratching in my memory banks??</para></question><answer>

<para>Q. Is there anything "odd" that FreeBSD does when compiling the

appears to be the memory banks.</para>
  
<para>A. Yes!  You'll see frequent references to ``daemons'' in the BSD
documentation, and what most people don't know is that this
refers to genuine, non-corporeal entities that now possess your
computer.  The scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as they best

<qandaentry><question
id="custrel">
<para>        How do I make my own custom release?
      </para></question><answer>

<para>To make a release you need to do three things: First, you need to
be running a kernel with the <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?vn">vn</ulink> driver configured
in.  Add this to your kernel config file and build a new kernel:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        pseudo-device vn         #Vnode driver (turns a file into a device)
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Second, you have to have the whole CVS repository at hand.
To get this you can use <ulink URL="../handbook/synching.html#CVSUP">CVSUP</ulink>
but in your supfile set the release name to cvs and remove any tag or
date fields:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        *default prefix=/home/ncvs
        *default base=/a
        *default host=cvsup.FreeBSD.org
        *default release=cvs
        *default delete compress use-rel-suffix

        ## Main Source Tree
        src-all
        src-eBones
        src-secure

        # Other stuff
        ports-all
        www
        doc-all
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Then run <command>cvsup -g supfile</command> to suck all the good bits onto your
box...</para>
  
<para>Finally, you need a chunk of empty space to build into. Let's
say it's in <filename>/some/big/filesystem</filename>, and from the example
above you've got the CVS repository in <filename>/home/ncvs</filename>:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>        setenv CVSROOT /home/ncvs        # or export CVSROOT=/home/ncvs
        cd /usr/src/release
        make release BUILDNAME=3.0-MY-SNAP CHROOTDIR=/some/big/filesystem/release
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>An entire release will be built in
<filename>/some/big/filesystem/release</filename> and you will have a full FTP-type
installation in <filename>/some/big/filesystem/release/R/ftp</filename> when you're
done.  If you want to build your SNAP along some other branch than
-CURRENT, you can also add <literal>RELEASETAG=SOMETAG</literal> to
the make release command line above, e.g. <literal>RELEASETAG=RELENG_2_2</literal>
would build an up-to-the- minute 2.2-STABLE snapshot.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>How do I create customized installation disks?</para></question><answer>

<para>The entire process of creating installation disks and source and
binary archives is automated by various targets in
<filename>/usr/src/release/Makefile</filename>.  The information there should
be enough to get you started.  However, it should be said that this
involves doing a ``make world'' and will therefore take up a lot of
time and disk space.</para>
  
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>``make world'' clobbers my existing installed binaries.</para></question><answer>

<para>Yes, this is the general idea; as its name might suggest,
``make world'' rebuilds every system binary from scratch, so you can be
certain of having a clean and consistent environment at the end (which
is why it takes so long).</para>
  
<para>If the environment variable <acronym>DESTDIR</acronym> is defined while running
``<emphasis remap=tt>make world</emphasis>'' or ``<emphasis remap=tt>make install</emphasis>'', the newly-created
binaries will be deposited in a directory tree identical to the
installed one, rooted at <emphasis remap=tt>&#36;{DESTDIR}</emphasis>.
Some random combination of shared libraries modifications and
program rebuilds can cause this to fail in ``<emphasis remap=tt>make world</emphasis>'',
however.</para>

<para>        When my system boots, it says ``(bus speed defaulted)''.

<para>The Adaptec 1542 SCSI host adapters allow the user to configure
their bus access speed in software.  Previous versions of the
1542 driver tried to determine the fastest usable speed and set
the adapter to that.  We found that this breaks some users'
systems, so you now have to define the ``<symbol>TUNE_1542</symbol>'' kernel
configuration option in order to have this take place.  Using it
on those systems where it works may make your disks run faster,
but on those systems where it doesn't, your data could be
corrupted.</para>

<para>By: <ulink URL="mailto:uhclem@nemesis.lonestar.org">Frank Durda IV</ulink></para>
  
<para>In a nutshell, there a few I/O ports that all of the PnP boards
respond to when the host asks if anyone is out there.  So when
the PnP probe routine starts, he asks if there are any PnP boards
present, and all the PnP boards respond with their model # to
a I/O read of the same port, so the probe routine gets a wired-OR
``yes'' to that question.  At least one bit will be on in that
reply.  Then the probe code is able to cause boards with board
model IDs (assigned by Microsoft/Intel) lower than X to go
``off-line''.  It then looks to see if any boards are still
responding to the query.  If the answer was ``<emphasis remap=tt>0</emphasis>'', then
there are no boards with IDs above X.  Now probe asks if there
are any boards below ``X''.  If so, probe knows there are boards
with a model numbers below X.  Probe then asks for boards greater
than X-(limit/4) to go off-line.  If repeats the query.  By
repeating this semi-binary search of IDs-in-range enough times,
the probing code will eventually identify all PnP boards present
in a given machine with a number of iterations that is much lower
than what 2^64 would take.</para>
  
<para>The IDs are two 32-bit fields (hence 2&circ;64) + 8 bit checksum.
The first 32 bits are a vendor identifier.  They never come out
and say it, but it appears to be assumed that different types of
boards from the same vendor could have different 32-bit vendor
ids.  The idea of needing 32 bits just for unique manufacturers
is a bit excessive.</para>
  
<para>The lower 32 bits are a serial #, ethernet address, something
that makes this one board unique.  The vendor must never produce
a second board that has the same lower 32 bits unless the upper
32 bits are also different.  So you can have multiple boards of
the same type in the machine and the full 64 bits will still be
unique.</para>
  
<para>The 32 bit groups can never be all zero.  This allows the
wired-OR to show non-zero bits during the initial binary search.</para>
  
<para>Once the system has identified all the board IDs present, it will
reactivate each board, one at a time (via the same I/O ports),
and find out what resources the given board needs, what interrupt
choices are available, etc.  A scan is made over all the boards
to collect this information.</para>
  
<para>This info is then combined with info from any ECU files on the
hard disk or wired into the MLB BIOS.  The ECU and BIOS PnP
support for hardware on the MLB is usually synthetic, and the
peripherals don't really do genuine PnP.  However by examining
the BIOS info plus the ECU info, the probe routines can cause the
devices that are PnP to avoid those devices the probe code cannot
relocate.</para>
  
<para>Then the PnP devices are visited once more and given their I/O,
DMA, IRQ and Memory-map address assignments.  The devices will
then appear at those locations and remain there until the next
reboot, although there is nothing that says you can't move them
around whenever you want.</para>
  
<para>There is a lot of oversimplification above, but you should get
the general idea.</para>
  
<para>Microsoft took over some of the primary printer status ports to
do PnP, on the logic that no boards decoded those addresses for
the opposing I/O cycles.  I found a genuine IBM printer board
that did decode writes of the status port during the early PnP
proposal review period, but MS said ``tough''.  So they do a
write to the printer status port for setting addresses, plus that
use that address + <literal>0x800</literal>, and a third I/O port for reading
that can be located anywhere between <literal>0x200</literal> and <literal>0x3ff</literal>.</para>

<para>Does FreeBSD support architectures other than the x86?</para></question><answer>

<para>Several groups of people have expressed interest in working on
multi-architecture ports for FreeBSD and the FreeBSD/AXP (ALPHA)
port is one such effort which has been quite successful, now
available in 3.0 SNAPshot release form at <ulink URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/alpha/">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/alpha</ulink>.  The ALPHA
port currently runs  on a growing number of ALPHA machine
types, among them the AlphaStation, AXPpci, PC164, Miata and Multia
models.  This port is not yet considered a full release and won't be
until a full compliment of system installation tools and a distribution
on CDROM installation media is available, including a reasonable
number of working ports and packages.
FreeBSD/AXP should be considered BETA quality software at this

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Alternative layout policies for directories</para></question><answer>

<para>In answer to the question of alternative layout policies for
directories, the scheme that is currently in use is unchanged
from what I wrote in 1983. I wrote that policy for the original
fast filesystem, and never revisited it. It works well at keeping
cylinder groups from filling up. As several of you have noted,   
it works poorly for find. Most filesystems are created from      
archives that were created by a depth first search (aka ftw).    
These directories end up being striped across the cylinder groups
thus creating a worst possible senario for future depth first    
searches. If one knew the total number of directories to be      
created, the solution would be to create (total / fs_ncg) per    
cylinder group before moving on. Obviously, one would have to    
create some heuristic to guess at this number. Even using a      
small fixed number like say 10 would make an order of magnitude
improvement. To differentiate restores from normal operation   
(when the current algorithm is probably more sensible), you    
could use the clustering of up to 10 if they were all done       
within a ten second window. Anyway, my conclusion is that this   
is an area ripe for experimentation.</para>

<para> [When] you see a message like this, it's not enough to just
reproduce it and send it in. The instruction pointer value that
I highlighted up there is important; unfortunately, it's also
configuration dependent. In other words, the value varies
depending on the exact kernel image that you're using. If you're
using a GENERIC kernel image from one of the snapshots, then
it's possible for somebody else to track down the offending
function, but if you're running a custom kernel then only
<emphasis>you</emphasis> can tell us where the fault occured.</para>
  
<para> What you should do is this:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Write down the instruction pointer value. Note that the
<literal>0x8:</literal> part at the begining is not significant in this case:
it's the <literal>0xf0xxxxxx</literal> part that we want.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>When the system reboots, do the following:
<literallayout>% nm /kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxxx
          </literallayout>
	  
where <literal>f0xxxxxx</literal> is the instruction pointer value. The
odds are you will not get an exact match since the symbols
in the kernel symbol table are for the entry points of
functions and the instruction pointer address will be
somewhere inside a function, not at the start. If you don't
get an exact match, omit the last digit from the instruction
pointer value and try again, i.e.:
<literallayout>% nm /kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxx
	  </literallayout>

If that doesn't yield any results, chop off another digit.
Repeat until you get some sort of output. The result will be
a possible list of functions which caused the panic. This is
a less than exact mechanism for tracking down the point of
failure, but it's better than nothing.</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
  
<para> I see people constantly show panic messages like this but
rarely do I see someone take the time to match up the
instruction pointer with a function in the kernel symbol table.</para>
  
<para> The best way to track down the cause of a panic is by
capturing a crash dump, then using <command>gdb(1)</command> to to a stack
trace on the crash dump. Of course, this depends on <command>gdb(1)</command>
in -CURRENT working correctly, which I can't guarantee (I recall
somebody saying that the new ELF-ized <command>gdb(1)</command> didn't handle
kernel crash dumps correctly: somebody should check this before
3.0 goes out of beta or there'll be a lot of red faces after the
CDs ship).</para>
  
<para>In any case, the method I normally use is this:</para>
  
<para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>Set up a kernel config file, optionally adding 'options DDB' if you
think you need the kernel debugger for something. (I use this mainly
for setting beakpoints if I suspect an infinite loop condition of
some kind.)</para>

<para> To make sure you capture a crash dump, you need edit

partition. This will cause the <command>rc(8)</command> scripts to use the

<command>dumpon(8)</command> manually. After a panic, the crash dump can be
recovered using <command>savecore(8)</command>; if <emphasis remap=tt>dumpdev</emphasis> is set in
<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the <command>rc(8)</command> scripts will run
<command>savecore(8)</command> automatically and put the crash dump in
<filename>/var/crash</filename>.</para>
  
<para> NOTE: FreeBSD crash dumps are usually the same size as the
physical RAM size of your machine. That is, if you have 64MB of
RAM, you will get a 64MB crash dump. Therefore you must make sure
there's enough space in <filename>/var/crash</filename> to hold the dump.
Alternatively, you run <command>savecore(8)</command> manually and have it
recover the crash dump to another directory where you have more
room. It's possible to limit the size of the crash dump by using
<literal>options MAXMEM=(foo)</literal> to set the amount of memory the kernel
will use to something a little more sensible. For example, if
you have 128MB of RAM, you can limit the kernel's memory usage
to 16MB so that your crash dump size will be 16MB instead of
128MB.</para>
  
<para> Once you have recovered the crash dump, you can get a stack
trace with <command>gdb(1)</command> as follows:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>% gdb -k /sys/compile/KERNELCONFIG/kernel.debug /var/crash/vmcore.0
(gdb) where
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para> Note that there may be several screens worth of information;
ideally you should use <command>script(1)</command> to capture all of them.
Using the unstripped kernel image with all the debug symbols
should show the exact line of kernel source code where the panic
occured. Usually you have to read the stack trace from the
bottom up in order to trace the exact sequence of events that
lead to the crash. You can also use <command>gdb(1)</command> to print out the
contents of various variables or structures in order to examine
the system state at the time of the crash.</para>
  
<para> Now, if you're really insane and have a second computer, you
can also configure <command>gdb(1)</command> to do remote debugging such that
you can use <command>gdb(1)</command> on one system to debug the kernel on
another system, including setting breakpoints, single-stepping
through the kernel code, just like you can do with a normal
user-mode program. I haven't played with this yet as I don't
often have the chance to set up two machines side by side for
debugging purposes.</para>
  
<para> <emphasis>[Bill adds: "I forgot to mention one thing: if you have
DDB enabled and the kernel drops into the debugger, you can
force a panic (and a crash dump) just by typing 'panic' at the
ddb prompt. It may stop in the debugger again during the panic
phase. If it does, type 'continue' and it will finish the crash
dump." -ed]</emphasis></para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>dlsym() stopped working for ELF executables!</para></question><answer>

<para>The ELF toolchain does not, by default, make the symbols 
defined in an executable visible to the dynamic linker.  
Consequently <function>dlsym()</function> searches on handles obtained 
from calls to <emphasis remap=tt>dlopen(NULL, flags)</emphasis> will fail to find
such symbols.</para>
  
<para>If you want to search, using <function>dlsym()</function>, for symbols 
present in the main executable of a process, you need to link 
the executable using the <option>-export-dynamic</option> option to the
<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?ld">ELF linker</ulink>.</para>

<qandaentry><question>
<para>Increasing or reducing the kernel address space</para></question><answer>

<para>By default, the kernel address space is 256 MB on FreeBSD 3.x
and 1 GB on FreeBSD 4.x. If you run a network-intensive server
(e.g. a large FTP or HTTP server), you might find that 256 MB is
not enough.</para>
  
<para>So how do you increase the address space? There are two aspects
to this. First, you need to tell the kernel to reserve a larger
portion of the address space for itself. Second, since the
kernel is loaded at the top of the address space, you need to
lower the load address so it doesn't bump its head against the
ceiling.</para>
  
<para>The first goal is achieved by increasing the value of
<acronym>NKPDE</acronym> in <filename>src/sys/i386/include/pmap.h</filename>. Here's what
it looks like for a 1 GB address space:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>#ifndef NKPDE
#ifdef SMP
#define NKPDE                   254     /* addressable number of page tables/pde's */
#else
#define NKPDE                   255     /* addressable number of page tables/pde's */
#endif  /* SMP */
#endif
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>To find the correct value of <acronym>NKPDE</acronym>, divide the desired
address space size (in megabytes) by four, then subtract one for
UP and two for SMP.</para>
  
<para>To achieve the second goal, you need to compute the correct load
address: simply subtract the address space size (in bytes) from
0x100100000; the result is 0xc0100000 for a 1 GB address space.
Set <symbol>LOAD_ADDRESS</symbol> in <filename>src/sys/i386/conf/Makefile.i386</filename>
to that value; then set the location counter in the beginning of
the section listing in <filename>src/sys/i386/conf/kernel.script</filename>
to the same value, as follows:</para>
  
<para>
<literallayout>OUTPUT_FORMAT("elf32-i386", "elf32-i386", "elf32-i386")
OUTPUT_ARCH(i386)
ENTRY(btext)
SEARCH_DIR(/usr/lib); SEARCH_DIR(/usr/obj/elf/home/src/tmp/usr/i386-unknown-freebsdelf/lib);
SECTIONS
{
  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  . = 0xc0100000 + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
  .interp     : { *(.interp)    }
      </literallayout>
</para>
  
<para>Then reconfig and rebuild your kernel. You will probably have
problems with <command>ps(1)</command>, <command>top(1)</command> and the like; <emphasis remap=tt>make
world</emphasis> should take care of it (or a manual rebuild of
<emphasis remap=tt>libkvm</emphasis>, <emphasis remap=tt>ps</emphasis> and <emphasis remap=tt>top</emphasis> after copying the patched
<filename>pmap.h</filename> to <filename>/usr/include/vm/</filename>.</para>
  
<para>NOTE: the size of the kernel address space must be a multiple of
four megabytes.</para>
  
<para>[<ulink URL="mailto:dg@FreeBSD.org">David Greenman</ulink>
adds: <emphasis> I think the kernel address space needs to be a power
of two, but I'm not certain about that. The old(er) boot code
used to monkey with the high order address bits and I think
expected at least 256MB granularity.]</emphasis></para>

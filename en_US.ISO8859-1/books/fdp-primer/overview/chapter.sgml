  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>Welcome to the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  Good quality
    documentation is very important to the success of FreeBSD, and the
    FreeBSD Documentation Project (FDP) is how a lot of that
    documentation is produced.  Your contributions are very
    valuable.</para>

  <para>This document's main purpose is to clearly explain
    <emphasis>how the FDP is organized</emphasis>, <emphasis>how to
      write and submit documentation to the FDP</emphasis>, and
    <emphasis>how to effectively use the tools available to you when
      writing documentation</emphasis>.</para>

  <indexterm>
    <primary>Membership</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para>Everyone is welcome to join the FDP.  There is no minimum
    membership requirement, no quota of documentation you need to
    produce per month.  All you need to do is subscribe to the
    &a.doc;.</para>

  <para>After you have finished reading this document you
    should:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Know which documentation is maintained by the FDP.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Be able to read and understand the SGML source code for
	the documentation maintained by the FDP.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Be able to make changes to the documentation.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Be able to submit your changes back for review and
	eventual inclusion in the FreeBSD documentation.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <sect1 id="overview-doc">
    <title>The FreeBSD Documentation Set</title>

    <para>The FDP is responsible for four categories of FreeBSD
      documentation.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Manual pages</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The English language system manual pages are not
	    written by the FDP, as they are part of the base system.
	    However, the FDP can (and has) re-worded parts of existing
	    manual pages to make them clearer, or to correct
	    inaccuracies.</para>

	  <para>The translation teams are responsible for translating
	    the system manual pages into different languages.  These
	    translations are kept within the FDP.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>FAQ</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The FAQ aims to address (in short question and answer
	    format) questions that are asked, or should be asked, on
	    the various mailing lists and newsgroups devoted to
	    FreeBSD.  The format does not permit long and
	    comprehensive answers.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Handbook</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The Handbook aims to be the comprehensive on-line
	    resource and reference for FreeBSD users.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Web site</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the main FreeBSD presence on the World Wide
	    Web, visible at <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/index.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/</ulink>
	    and many mirrors around the world.  The web site is many
	    people's first exposure to FreeBSD.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The documentation for the web site, &os; Handbook, and FAQ
      are available in the <literal>doc/</literal> Subversion
      repository, which is located at
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/</literal>.</para>

    <para>Manual pages are available in the <literal>src/</literal>
      Subversion repository, which is available at
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/</literal>.</para>

    <para>This means that the logs of changes to these
      files are visible to anyone, and anyone can use
      <application>svn</application> to view the changes.</para>

    <para>In addition, many people have written tutorials or other web
      sites relating to FreeBSD.  Some of these are stored in the
      Subversion repository as well (where the author has agreed to
      this).  In other cases the author has decided to keep his
      documentation separate from the main FreeBSD repository.  The
      FDP endeavors to provide links to as much of this documentation
      as possible.</para>

  <sect1 id="overview-before">
    <title>Before You Start</title>

    <para>This document assumes that you already know:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>How to maintain an up-to-date local copy of the FreeBSD
	  documentation by maintaining a local copy of the FreeBSD
	  Subversion repository using
	  <application>svn</application>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>How to download and install new software using either
	  the FreeBSD Ports system or &man.pkg.add.1;.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="overview-quick-start">
    <title>Quick Start</title>

    <para>If you just want to get going, and feel confident you can
      pick things up as you go along, follow these
      instructions.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Install the
	  <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename>
	  meta-port.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/textproc/docproj</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make JADETEX=no install</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Get a local copy of the FreeBSD <filename>doc</filename>
	  tree using <application>svn</application>.</para>

	<para>If network bandwidth or local drive space is a concern,
	  then at minimum, the <filename>head/share</filename> and
	  <filename>head/<replaceable>language</replaceable>/share</filename>
	  directories will need to be checked out.  For
	  example:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mkdir -p head/share</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>mkdir -p head/en_US.ISO8859-1/share</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head/share head/share</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head/en_US.ISO8859-1/share head/en_US.ISO8859-1/share</userinput></screen>

	<para>If you have plenty of disk space then you could check
	  out everything.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head head</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>If you are preparing a change to an existing book or
	  article, check it out of the repository as necessary.  If
	  you are planning on contributing a new book or article then
	  use an existing one as a guide.</para>

	<para>For example, if you want to contribute a new article
	  about setting up a VPN between FreeBSD and Windows 2000 you
	  might do the following.</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <para>Check out the <filename>articles</filename>
	      directory.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles</userinput></screen>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Copy an existing article to use as a template.  In
	      this case, you have decided that your new article
	      belongs in a directory called
	      <filename>vpn-w2k</filename>.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd head/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn export committers-guide vpn-w2k</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
	</procedure>

	<para>If you wanted to edit an existing document, such as the
	  FAQ, which is in
	  <filename>head/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq</filename> you
	  would check it out of the repository like this.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Edit the <filename>.sgml</filename> files using your
	  editor of choice.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Test the markup using the <maketarget>lint</maketarget>
	  target.  This will quickly find any errors in the document
	  without actually performing the time-consuming
	  transformation.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make lint</userinput></screen>

	<para>When you are ready to actually build the document, you
	  may specify a single format or a list of formats in the
	  <varname>FORMATS</varname> variable.  Currently,
	  <literal>html</literal>, <literal>html-split</literal>,
	  <literal>txt</literal>, <literal>ps</literal>,
	  <literal>pdf</literal>, and <literal>rtf</literal> are
	  supported.  The most up to date list of supported formats is
	  listed at the top of the
	  <filename>head/share/mk/doc.docbook.mk</filename> file.
	  Make sure to use quotes around the list of formats when you
	  build more than one format with a single command.</para>

	<para>For example, to convert the document to
	  <literal>html</literal> only, you would use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make FORMATS=html</userinput></screen>

	<para>But when you want to convert the document to both
	  <literal>html</literal> and <literal>txt</literal> format,
	  you could use either two separate &man.make.1; runs,
	  with:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make FORMATS=html</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make FORMATS=txt</userinput></screen>

	<para>or, you can do it in one command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make FORMATS="html txt"</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Submit your changes using &man.send-pr.1;.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

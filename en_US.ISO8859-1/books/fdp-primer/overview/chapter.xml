  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>Welcome to the &os; Documentation Project
    (<acronym>FDP</acronym>).  Quality documentation is crucial
    to the success of &os;, and we value your contributions very
    highly.</para>

  <para>This document describes how the <acronym>FDP</acronym> is
    organized, how to write and submit documentation, and how to
    effectively use the available tools.</para>

  <para>Everyone is welcome to contribute to the
    <acronym>FDP</acronym>.  Willingness to contribute is the only
    membership requirement.</para>

  <para>This primer shows how to:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Identify which parts of &os; are maintained by the
	<acronym>FDP</acronym>.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Install the required documentation tools and files.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Make changes to the documentation.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Submit changes back for review and inclusion in the &os;
	documentation.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <sect1 xml:id="overview-quick-start">
    <title>Quick Start</title>

    <para>Some preparatory steps must be taken before editing the &os;
      documentation.  First, subscribe to the &a.doc;.  Some team
      members also interact on the <literal>#bsddocs</literal>
      <acronym>IRC</acronym> channel on
      <link xlink:href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</link>.  These
      people can help with questions or problems involving the
      documentation.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Install the
	  <package>textproc/docproj</package> meta-package
	  and <application>Subversion</application>.
	  This meta-package installs all of the software needed to
	  edit and build &os; documentation.  The
	  <application>Subversion</application> package is needed to
	  obtain a working copy of the documentation and generate
	  patches with.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install docproj subversion</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Install a local working copy of the documentation from
	  the &os; repository in
	  <filename>~/doc</filename> (see
	  <xref linkend="working-copy"/>).</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Configure the text editor:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Word wrap set to 70 characters.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Tab stops set to 2.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Replace each group of 8 leading spaces with a
	      single tab.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Specific editor configurations are listed in
	  <xref linkend="editor-config"/>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Update the local working copy:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Edit the documentation files that require changes.  If a
	  file needs major changes, consult the mailing list for
	  input.</para>

	<para>References to tag and entity usage can be found in
	  <xref linkend="xhtml-markup"/> and
	  <xref linkend="docbook-markup"/>.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>After editing, check for problems by running:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>igor -R filename.xml | less -RS</userinput></screen>

	<para>Review the output and edit the file to fix any problems
	  shown, then rerun the command to find any remaining
	  problems.  Repeat until all of the errors are
	  resolved.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para><emphasis>Always</emphasis> build-test changes before
	  submitting them.  Running <userinput>make</userinput> in the
	  top-level directory of the documentation being edited will
	  generate that documentation in split HTML format.  For
	  example, to build the English version of the Handbook in
	  <acronym>HTML</acronym>, run <command>make</command> in the
	  <filename>en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/</filename>
	  directory.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>When changes are complete and tested, generate a
	  <quote>diff file</quote>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ~/doc</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn diff &gt; <replaceable>bsdinstall</replaceable>.diff.txt</userinput></screen>

	<para>Give the diff file a descriptive name.  In the example
	  above, changes have been made to the
	  <filename>bsdinstall</filename> portion of
	  the Handbook.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Submit the diff file using the web-based <link
	    xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Documentation">Problem
	    Report</link> system.  If using the web form, enter a
	  Summary of <emphasis>[patch] <replaceable>short description
	      of problem</replaceable></emphasis>.  Select the
	  Component <literal>Documentation</literal>.  In the
	  Description field, enter a short description of the changes
	  and any important details about them.  Use the
	  <guibutton>[&nbsp;Add an attachment&nbsp;]</guibutton>
	  button to attach the diff file.  Finally, use the
	  <guibutton>[&nbsp;Submit Bug&nbsp;]</guibutton> button to
	  submit your diff to the problem report system.</para>

    <title>The &os; Documentation Set</title>

    <para>The <acronym>FDP</acronym> is responsible for four
      categories of &os; documentation.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Handbook</emphasis>: The Handbook is the
	  comprehensive online resource and reference for &os;
	  users.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>FAQ</emphasis>: The <acronym>FAQ</acronym>
	  uses a short question and answer format to address questions
	  that are frequently asked on the various mailing lists and
	  forums devoted to &os;.  This format does not permit long
	  and comprehensive answers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Manual pages</emphasis>: The English language
	  system manual pages are usually not written by the
	  <acronym>FDP</acronym>, as they are part of the base system.
	  However, the <acronym>FDP</acronym> can reword parts of
	  existing manual pages to make them clearer or to correct
	  inaccuracies.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Web site</emphasis>: This is the main &os;
	  presence on the web, visible at <link
	    xlink:href="https://www.freebsd.org/index.html">
	    https://www.FreeBSD.org/</link>
	  and many mirrors around the world.  The web site is
	  typically a new user's first exposure to &os;.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Translation teams are responsible for translating the
      Handbook and web site into different languages.  Manual pages
      are not translated at present.</para>

    <para>Documentation source for the &os; web site, Handbook, and
      <acronym>FAQ</acronym> is available in the documentation
      repository at
      <literal>https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/</literal>.</para>

    <para>Source for manual pages is available in a separate
      source repository located at
      <literal>https://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/</literal>.</para>

    <para>Documentation commit messages are visible with
      <command>svn log</command>.  Commit messages are also
      archived at <uri xlink:href="&a.svn-doc-all.url;">
	&a.svn-doc-all.url;</uri>.</para>

    <para>Web frontends to both of these repositories are available
      at <link xlink:href="https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/doc/"></link>
      and <link
	xlink:href="https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base/"></link>.</para>

    <para>Many people have written tutorials or how-to articles about
      &os;.  Some are stored as part of the <acronym>FDP</acronym>
      files.  In other cases, the author has decided to keep the
      documentation separate.  The <acronym>FDP</acronym> endeavors to
      provide links to as much of this external documentation as
      possible.</para>

<chapter id="tools">
  <title>Tools</title>

  <para>The FDP uses a number of different software tools to help
    manage the FreeBSD documentation, convert it to different output
    formats, and so on.  You will need to use these tools yourself if
    you are to work with the FreeBSD documentation.</para>

  <para>All these tools are available as FreeBSD Ports and Packages,
    greatly simplifying the work you have to do to install
    them.</para>

  <para>You will need to install these tools before you work through
    any of the examples in later chapters.  The actual usage of these
    tools is covered in later chapters.</para>

  <tip>
    <title>Use <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename> If
      Possible</title>

    <para>You can save yourself a lot of time if you install the
      <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename> port.  This
      is a <emphasis>meta-port</emphasis> which does not contain any
      software itself.  Instead, it depends on various other ports
      being installed correctly.  Installing this port
      <emphasis>should</emphasis> automatically download and install
      all of the packages listed in this chapter that you need.</para>

    <para>One of the packages that you might need is the
      <application>JadeTeX</application> macro set.  In turn, this
      macro set requires &tex; to be installed.  &tex; is a large
      package, and you only need it if you want to produce Postscript
      or PDF output.</para>

    <para>To save yourself time and space you must specify whether or
      not you want <application>JadeTeX</application> (and therefore
      &tex;) installed when you install this port.  Either do:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make JADETEX=yes install</userinput></screen>

    <para>or</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make JADETEX=no install</userinput></screen>

    <para>as necessary.  Alternatively you may install
      <filename role="package">textproc/docproj-jadetex</filename> or
      <filename role="package">textproc/docproj-nojadetex</filename>.
      These slave ports define the <makevar>JADETEX</makevar> variable
      for you, therefore they will install the same suite of
      applications on your machine.  Note that you can produce only
      HTML or ASCII text output if you do not install
      <application>JadeTeX</application>.  PostScript or PDF output
      requires &tex;.</para>

      <para>These programs are required before you can usefully work

    <para>You do not need to have any of the following installed.

	    <para>If you do not intend to convert your documentation
	      to one of these formats (i.e., HTML, plain text, and RTF

	    <important>
	      <para>If you decide to install

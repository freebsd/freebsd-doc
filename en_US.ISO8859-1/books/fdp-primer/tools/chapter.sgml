  <title>Tools</title>
  
  <para>The FDP uses a number of different software tools to help
    manage the FreeBSD documentation, convert it to different output
    formats, and so on.  You will need to use these tools yourself if
    you are to work with the FreeBSD documentation.</para>                    

  <para>All these tools are available as FreeBSD Ports and Packages,
    greatly simplifying the work you have to do to install
    them.</para>                                                              
  
  <para>You will need to install these tools before you work through
    any of the examples in later chapters.  The actual usage of these
    tools is covered in later chapters.</para>     

  <tip>
    <title>Use <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename> if possible</title>

    <para>You can save yourself a lot of time if you install the
      <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename> port.  This is a
      <emphasis>meta-port</emphasis> which does not contain any software
      itself.  Instead, it depends on various other ports being installed
      correctly.  Installing this port <emphasis>should</emphasis>
      automatically download and install all of the packages listed in this
      chapter that you need.</para>

    <para>One of the packages that you might need is the JadeTeX macro set.
      In turn, this macro set requires TeX to be installed.  TeX is a large
      package, and you only need it if you want to produce Postscript or PDF
      output.</para>

    <para>To save yourself time and space you must specify whether or not you
      want JadeTeX (and therefore TeX) installed when you install this port.
      Either do:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make JADETEX=yes install</userinput></screen>

    <para>or</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make JADETEX=no install</userinput></screen>

    <para>as necessary.  Alternatively you may install <filename
      role="package">textproc/docproj-jadetex</filename> or <filename
      role="package">textproc/docproj-nojadetex</filename>.  These slave ports
      define the <makevar>JADETEX</makevar> variable for you, therefore they
      will install the same suite of applications on your machine.
      Note that you can produce only HTML or ASCII
      text output if you do not install <application>JadeTeX</application>.
      PostScript or PDF output require <application>TeX</application>.</para>

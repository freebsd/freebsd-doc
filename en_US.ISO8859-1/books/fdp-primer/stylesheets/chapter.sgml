<chapter id="stylesheets">
  <title>* Stylesheets</title>

  <para>SGML says nothing about how a document should be displayed to
    the user, or rendered on paper.  To do that, various languages
    have been developed to describe stylesheets, including DynaText,
    Panorama, SPICE, JSSS, FOSI, CSS, and DSSSL.</para>

  <para>For DocBook, we are using stylesheets written in DSSSL.  For
    HTML we are using CSS.</para>

  <sect1 id="stylesheets-dsssl">
    <title>* DSSSL</title>

    <para>The Documentation Project uses a slightly customized version
      of Norm Walsh's modular DocBook stylesheets.</para>

    <para>These can be found in <filename
	role="package">textproc/dsssl-docbook-modular</filename>.</para>

    <para>The modified stylesheets are not in the ports system.
      Instead they are part of the Documentation Project source
      repository, and can be found in
      <filename>doc/share/sgml/freebsd.dsl</filename>.  It is well
      commented, and pending completion of this section you are
      encouraged to examine that file to see how some of the available
      options in the standard stylesheets have been configured in
      order to customize the output for the FreeBSD Documentation
      Project.  That file also contains examples showing how to extend
      the elements that the stylesheet understands, which is how the
      FreeBSD specific elements have been formatted.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="stylesheets-css">
    <title>CSS</title>

    <para>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) are a mechanism for attaching
      style information (font, weight, size, color, and so forth) to
      elements in an HTML document without abusing HTML to do
      so.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The DocBook Documents</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD DSSSL stylesheets include a reference to a
	stylesheet, <filename>docbook.css</filename>, which is
	expected to appear in the same directory as the HTML files.
	The project-wide CSS file is copied from
	<filename>doc/share/misc/docbook.css</filename> when documents
	are converted to HTML, and is installed automatically.</para>

  <title>Documentation Directory Structure</title>

  <para>Files and directories in the
    <filename>doc/</filename> tree follow a
    structure meant to:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Make it easy to automate converting the document to other
	formats.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Promote consistency between the different documentation
	organizations, to make it easier to switch between working on
	different documents.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Make it easy to decide where in the tree new documentation
	should be placed.</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>In addition, the documentation tree must accommodate
    documents in many different languages and encodings.  It is
    important that the documentation tree structure does not enforce
    any particular defaults or cultural preferences.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="structure-top">
    <title>The Top Level,
      <filename>doc/</filename></title>

    <para>There are two types of directory under
      <filename>doc/</filename>, each with very
      specific directory names and meanings.</para>

    <informaltable pgwide="1" frame="none">
      <tgroup cols="2">
	<thead>
	  <row>
	    <entry>Directory</entry>
	    <entry>Usage</entry>
	  </row>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
	  <row>
	    <entry valign="top">
	      <filename>share</filename></entry>

	    <entry>Contains files that are not specific to the various
	      translations and encodings of the documentation.
	      Contains subdirectories to further categorize the
	      information.  For example, the files that comprise the
	      &man.make.1; infrastructure are in
	      <filename>share/mk</filename>, while the additional
	      <acronym>XML</acronym> support files (such as the &os;
	      extended DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym>) are in
	      <filename>share/xml</filename>.</entry>
	  </row>

	  <row>
	    <entry valign="top">
	      <filename><replaceable>lang</replaceable>.<replaceable>encoding</replaceable></filename></entry>

	    <entry>One directory exists for each available translation
	      and encoding of the documentation, for example
	      <filename>en_US.ISO8859-1/</filename>
	      and <filename>zh_TW.UTF-8/</filename>.
	      The names are long, but by fully specifying the language
	      and encoding we prevent any future headaches when a
	      translation team wants to provide documentation in the
	      same language but in more than one encoding.  This also
	      avoids problems that might be caused by a future switch
	      to Unicode.</entry>

    <title>The
      <filename><replaceable>lang</replaceable>.<replaceable>encoding</replaceable>/</filename>
      Directories</title>

    <para>These directories contain the documents themselves.  The
      documentation is split into up to three more categories at
      this level, indicated by the different directory names.</para>

	    <entry>Documentation marked up as a DocBook
	      <tag>article</tag> (or equivalent).  Reasonably

	      available as one <acronym>XHTML</acronym> file.</entry>

	  <row>

	    <entry>Documentation marked up as a DocBook
	      <tag>book</tag> (or equivalent).  Book length,
	      and broken up into chapters.  Normally available as both
	      one large <acronym>XHTML</acronym> file (for people with
	      fast connections, or who want to print it easily from a
	      browser) and as a collection of linked, smaller
	      files.</entry>
	  </row>

	  <row>
	    <entry valign="top">
	      <filename>man</filename></entry>

	    <entry>For translations of the system manual pages.  This

	      directories, corresponding to the sections that have

      </tgroup>
    </informaltable>

    <para>Not every <filename
	role="directory"><replaceable>lang</replaceable>.<replaceable>encoding</replaceable></filename>
      directory will have all of these subdirectories.  It depends on
      how much translation has been accomplished by that translation
      team.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="structure-document">
    <title>Document-Specific Information</title>

    <para>This section contains specific notes about particular

    <sect2 xml:id="structure-document-handbook">
      <title>The Handbook</title>

      <subtitle><filename>books/handbook/</filename></subtitle>

      <para>The Handbook is written in DocBook <acronym>XML</acronym>
	using the &os; DocBook extended <acronym>DTD</acronym>.</para>

      <para>The Handbook is organized as a DocBook
	<tag>book</tag>.  The book is divided into
	<tag>part</tag>s, each of which contains several
	<tag>chapter</tag>s.  <tag>chapter</tag>s are
	further subdivided into sections (<tag>sect1</tag>)
	and subsections (<tag>sect2</tag>,
	<tag>sect3</tag>) and so on.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="structure-document-handbook-physical">
	<title>Physical Organization</title>

	<para>There are a number of files and directories within the
	  <filename>handbook</filename> directory.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The Handbook's organization may change over time, and
	    this document may lag in detailing the organizational
	    changes.  Post questions about Handbook organization to
	    the &a.doc;.</para>
	</note>

	<sect4 xml:id="structure-document-handbook-physical-Makefile">
	  <title><filename>Makefile</filename></title>

	  <para>The <filename>Makefile</filename> defines some
	    variables that affect how the <acronym>XML</acronym>
	    source is converted to other formats, and lists the
	    various source files that make up the Handbook.  It then
	    includes the standard <filename>doc.project.mk</filename>,
	    to bring in the rest of the code that handles converting
	    documents from one format to another.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 xml:id="structure-document-handbook-physical-book-xml">
	  <title><filename>book.xml</filename></title>

	  <para>This is the top level document in the Handbook.  It
	    contains the Handbook's <link
	      linkend="xml-primer-doctype-declaration">DOCTYPE
	      declaration</link>, as well as the elements that
	    describe the Handbook's structure.</para>

	  <para><filename>book.xml</filename> uses <link
	      linkend="xml-primer-parameter-entities">parameter
	      entities</link> to load in the files with the
	    <filename>.ent</filename> extension.  These files
	    (described later) then define <link
	      linkend="xml-primer-general-entities">general
	      entities</link> that are used throughout the rest of the
	    Handbook.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4
	  xml:id="structure-document-handbook-physical-chapters-xml">
	  <title><filename
	      role="directory"><replaceable>directory</replaceable>/chapter.xml</filename></title>

	  <para>Each chapter in the Handbook is stored in a file
	    called <filename>chapter.xml</filename> in a separate
	    directory from the other chapters.  Each directory is
	    named after the value of the <literal>id</literal>
	    attribute on the <tag>chapter</tag>
	    element.</para>

	  <para>For example, if one of the chapter files
	    contains:</para>

	  <programlisting><tag class="starttag">chapter id="kernelconfig"</tag>
...
<tag class="endtag">chapter</tag></programlisting>

	  <para>Then it will be called
	    <filename>chapter.xml</filename> in the
	    <filename>kernelconfig</filename> directory.  In general,
	    the entire contents of the chapter are in this one
	    file.</para>

	  <para>When the <acronym>XHTML</acronym> version of the
	    Handbook is produced, this will yield
	    <filename>kernelconfig.html</filename>.  This is because
	    of the <literal>id</literal> value, and is not related to
	    the name of the directory.</para>

	  <para>In earlier versions of the Handbook, the files were
	    stored in the same directory as
	    <filename>book.xml</filename>, and named after the value
	    of the <literal>id</literal> attribute on the file's
	    <tag>chapter</tag> element.  Now, it is possible to
	    include images in each chapter.  Images for each Handbook
	    chapter are stored within
	    <filename>share/images/books/handbook</filename>.  The
	    localized version of these images should be placed in the
	    same directory as the <acronym>XML</acronym> sources for
	    each chapter.  Namespace collisions are inevitable, and it
	    is easier to work with several directories with a few
	    files in them than it is to work with one directory that
	    has many files in it.</para>

	  <para>A brief look will show that there are many directories
	    with individual <filename>chapter.xml</filename> files,
	    including <filename>basics/chapter.xml</filename>,
	    <filename>introduction/chapter.xml</filename>, and
	    <filename>printing/chapter.xml</filename>.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>Do not name chapters or directories after
	      their ordering within the Handbook.  This ordering can
	      change as the content within the Handbook is
	      reorganized.  Reorganization should be possible without
	      renaming files, unless entire chapters are being
	      promoted or demoted within the hierarchy.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>The <filename>chapter.xml</filename> files are not
	    complete <acronym>XML</acronym> documents that can be
	    built individually.  They can only be built
	    as parts of the whole Handbook.</para>

<chapter id="sgml-markup">
  <title>SGML Markup</title>

  <para>This chapter describes the three markup languages you will encounter
    when you contribute to the FreeBSD documentation project.  Each section
    describes the markup language, and details the markup that you are likely
    to want to use, or that is already in use.</para>

  <para>These markup languages contain a large number of elements, and it can
    be confusing sometimes to know which element to use for a particular
    situation.  This section goes through the elements you are most likely to
    need, and gives examples of how you would use them.</para>
  
  <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> an exhaustive list of elements, since
    that would just reiterate the documentation for each language.  The aim of
    this section is to list those elements more likely to be useful to you.
    If you have a question about how best to markup a particular piece of
    content, please post it to the FreeBSD Documentation Project mailing list
    <email>freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org</email>.</para>

  <note>
    <title>Inline vs. block</title>
    
    <para>In the remainder of this document, when describing elements,
      <emphasis>inline</emphasis> means that the element can occur within a
      block element, and does not cause a line break.  A
      <emphasis>block</emphasis> element, by comparison, will cause a line
      break (and other processing) when it is encountered.</para>
  </note>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>HTML</title>
    
    <para>HTML, the HyperText Markup Language, is the markup language of
      choice on the World Wide Web.  More information can be found at
      &lt;URL:<ulink
	url="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</ulink>&gt;.</para>

    <para>HTML is used to markup pages on the FreeBSD web site.  It should not
      (generally) be used to mark up other documention, since DocBook offers a
      far richer set of elements to choose from.  Consequently, you will
      normally only encounter HTML pages if you are writing for the web
      site.</para>

    <para>HTML has gone through a number of versions, 1, 2, 3.0, 3.2, and the
      latest, 4.0 (available in both <emphasis>strict</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>loose</emphasis> variants).</para>
	  
    <para>The HTML DTDs are available from the ports collection in the
      <filename>textproc/html</filename> port.  They are automatically
      installed as part of the <filename>textproc/docproj</filename>
      port.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Formal Public Identifier (FPI)</title>

      <para>There are a number of HTML FPIs, depending upon the version (also
	known as the level) of HTML that you want to declare your document to
	be compliant with.</para>

      <para>The majority of HTML documents on the FreeBSD web site comply with
	the loose version of HTML 4.0.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Sectional elements</title>

      <para>An HTML document is normally split in to two sections.  The first
	section, called the <emphasis>head</emphasis>, contains
	meta-information about the document, such as its title, the name of
	the author, the parent document, and so on.  The second section, the
	<emphasis>body</emphasis>, contains the content that will be displayed
	to the user.</para>

      <para>These sections are indicated with <sgmltag>head</sgmltag> and
	<sgmltag>body</sgmltag> elements respectively.  These elements are
	contained within the top-level <sgmltag>html</sgmltag> element.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Normal HTML document structure</title>

	<programlisting>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
	  &lt;title><replaceable>The document's title</replaceable>&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>

  &lt;body>

    &hellip;

  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></programlisting>

      <sect3>
	<title>Headings</title>

	<para>HTML allows you to denote headings in your document, at up to
	  six different levels.</para>

	<para>The largest and most prominent heading is <sgmltag>h1</sgmltag>,
	  then <sgmltag>h2</sgmltag>, continuing down to
	  <sgmltag>h6</sgmltag>.</para>

	<para>The element's content is the text of the heading.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>h1</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>h2</sgmltag>, etc.</title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<h1>First section</h1>

<!-- Document introduction goes here -->

<h2>This is the heading for the first section</h2>

<!-- Content for the first section goes here -->

<h3>This is the heading for the first sub-section</h3>

<!-- Content for the first sub-section goes here -->

<h2>This is the heading for the second section</h2>

<!-- Content for the second section goes here -->]]></programlisting>	    
	</example>
	
	<para>Generally, an HTML page should have one first level heading
	  (<sgmltag>h1</sgmltag>).  This can contain many second level
	  headings (<sgmltag>h2</sgmltag>), which can in turn contain many
	  third level headings.  Each
	  <sgmltag>h<replaceable>n</replaceable></sgmltag> element should have
	  the same element, but one further up the hierarchy, preceeding it.
	  Leaving gaps in the numbering is to be avoided.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Bad ordering of
	    <sgmltag>h<replaceable>n</replaceable></sgmltag> elements</title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>

      <sect3>
	<title>Paragraphs</title>

	<para>HTML supports a single paragraph element,
	  <sgmltag>p</sgmltag>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>p</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>

  other element.</p>]]></programlisting>
	</example>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Block quotations</title>

	<para>A block quotation is an extended quotation from another document
	  that should not appear within the current paragraph.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>blockquote</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>

      <sect3>
	<title>Lists</title>

	<para>You can present the user with three types of lists, ordered,
	  unordered, and definition.</para>

	<para>Typically, each entry in an ordered list will be numbered, while
	  each entry in an unordered list will be proceeded by a bullet point.
	  Definition lists are composed of two sections for each entry.  The
	  first section is the term being defined, and the second section is
	  the definition of the term.</para>

	<para>Ordered lists are indicated by the <sgmltag>ol</sgmltag>
	  element, unordered lists by the <sgmltag>ul</sgmltag> element, and
	  definition lists by the <sgmltag>dl</sgmltag> element.</para>

	<para>Ordered and unordered lists contain listitems, indicated by the
	  <sgmltag>li</sgmltag> element.  A listitem can contain textual
	  content, or it may be further wrapped in one or more
	  <sgmltag>p</sgmltag> elements.</para>

	<para>Definition lists contain definition terms
	  (<sgmltag>dt</sgmltag>) and definition descriptions
	  (<sgmltag>dd</sgmltag>).  A definition term can only contain inline
	  elements.  A definition description can contain other block
	  elements.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>ul</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>ol</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<p>An unordered list.  Listitems will probably be

      <sect3>
	<title>Pre-formatted text</title>

	<para>You can indicate that text should be shown to the user exactly
	  as it is in the file.  Typically, this means that the text is shown
	  in a fixed font, multiple spaces are not merged in to one, and line
	  breaks in the text are significant.</para>

	<para>In order to do this, wrap the content in the
	  <sgmltag>pre</sgmltag> element.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>pre</sgmltag></title>

	<title>Tables</title>

	<note>
	  <para>Most text-mode browsers (such as Lynx) do not render tables
	    particularly effectively.  If you are relying on the tabular
	    display of your content, you should consider using alternative
	    markup to prevent confusion.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Mark up tabular information using the <sgmltag>table</sgmltag>
	  element.  A table consists of one or more table rows
	  (<sgmltag>tr</sgmltag>), each containing one or more cells of table
	  data (<sgmltag>td</sgmltag>).  Each cell can contain other block
	  elements, such as paragraphs or lists.  It can also contain another
	  table (this nesting can repeat indefinitely).  If the cell only
	  contains one paragraph then you do not need to include the
	  <sgmltag>p</sgmltag> element.</para>

	<title>Content size</title>

	<para>You can indicate that content should be shown in a larger or

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <sgmltag>big</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>small</sgmltag>
	      around the content you wish to change size.  These tags can be
	      nested, so <literal>&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;This is much

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <sgmltag>font</sgmltag> with the <literal>size</literal>
	      attribute set to <literal>+1</literal> or <literal>-1</literal>
	      respectively.  This has the same effect as using
	      <sgmltag>big</sgmltag> or <sgmltag>small</sgmltag>.  However,
	      the use of this approach is deprecated.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <sgmltag>font</sgmltag> with the <literal>size</literal>

    <para>DocBook was designed by the <ulink

      a DTD for writing technical documentation.  As such, and unlike LinuxDoc
      and HTML, DocBook is very heavily orientated towards markup that
      describes <emphasis>what</emphasis> something is, rather than describing
      <emphasis>how</emphasis> it should be presented.</para>

      <title>Sectional elements</title>

      <para>DocBook contains a number of elements for marking up the structure
	of a book.</para>

      <para>Generally, the top level (first) element will be
	<sgmltag>book</sgmltag>.</para>

      <para>A book is organised into <sgmltag>chapter</sgmltag>s.  This is a
	mandatory requirement.  There may be <sgmltag>part</sgmltag>s between
	the book and the chapter to provide another layer of organisation.
	The Handbook is arranged in this way.</para>

      <para>A chapter may (or may not) contain one or more sections.  These
	are indicated with the <sgmltag>sect1</sgmltag> element.  If a section
	contains another section then use the <sgmltag>sect2</sgmltag>
	element, and so on, up to <sgmltag>sect5</sgmltag>.</para>

      <para>Chapters and sections contain the remainder of the content.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Starting a book</title>

	<para>The content of the book is contained within the
	  <sgmltag>book</sgmltag> element.  As well as containing structural
	  markup, this element can contain elements that include additional
	  information about the book.  This is either meta-information, used
	  for reference purposes, or additional content used to produce a
	  title page.</para>

	<para>This additional information should be contained within
	  <sgmltag>bookinfo</sgmltag>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Boilerplate <sgmltag>book</sgmltag> with
	    <sgmltag>bookinfo</sgmltag></title>

	  <!-- Can't put this in a marked section because of the
               replaceable elements -->

	<title>Indicating chapters</title>

	<para>Use <sgmltag>chapter</sgmltag> to mark up your chapters.  Each

	<para>A chapter can not be empty, it must contain elements in addition
	  to <sgmltag>title</sgmltag>.  If you need to include an empty
	  chapter then just use an empty paragraph.</para>

	<example>

  <title>This is an empty chapter</title>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Sections below chapters</title>

	<para>Chapters can be broken up into sections, subsections, and so
	  on.  Use the <sgmltag>sect<replaceable>n</replaceable></sgmltag>
	  element.  The <replaceable>n</replaceable> indicates the section
	  number, which identifies the section level.</para>

	<para>The first <sgmltag>sect<replaceable>n</replaceable></sgmltag> is
	  <sgmltag>sect1</sgmltag>.  You can have one or more of these in a
	  chapter.  They can contain one or more <sgmltag>sect2</sgmltag>
	  elements, and so on, down to <sgmltag>sect5</sgmltag>.</para>

	<title>Tables</title>
	
	<para>Unlike HTML, you do not need to use tables for layout purposes,
	  as the stylesheet handles those issues for you.  Instead, just use
	  tables for marking up tabular data.</para>

	<para>In general terms (and see the DocBook documentation for more
	  detail) a table (which can be either formal or informal) consists of
	  a <sgmltag>table</sgmltag> element.  This contains at least one
	  <sgmltag>tgroup</sgmltag> element, which specifies (as an attribute)
	  the number of columns in this table group.  Within the tablegroup
	  you can then have one <sgmltag>thead</sgmltag> element, which
	  contains elements for the table headings (column headings), and one
	  <sgmltag>tbody</sgmltag> which contains the body of the
	  table.</para>

	<para>Both <sgmltag>tgroup</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>thead</sgmltag>
	  contain <sgmltag>row</sgmltag> elements, which in turn contain
	  <sgmltag>entry</sgmltag> elements.  Each <sgmltag>entry</sgmltag>
	  element specifies one cell in the table.</para>

	<title>Applications, commands, options, and cites</title>
	
	<para>You will frequently want to refer to both applications and
	  commands when writing for the Handbook.  The distinction between
	  them is simple; an application is the name for a suite (or possibly
	  just 1) of programs that fulfil a particular task.  A command is the
	  name of a program that the user can run.</para>

	<para>In addition, you will occasionally need to list one or more of
	  the options that a command might take.</para>
	
	<para>Finally, you will often want to list a command with it's manual
	  section number, in the &ldquo;command(number)&rdquo; format so
	  common in Unix manuals.</para>
	
	<para>Mark up application names with
	  <sgmltag>application</sgmltag>.</para>
	
	<para>When you want to list a command with it's manual section number
	  (which should be most of the time) the DocBook element is 
	  <sgmltag>citerefentry</sgmltag>.  This will contain a further two
	  elements, <sgmltag>refentrytitle</sgmltag> and
	  <sgmltag>manvolnum</sgmltag>.  The content of
	  <sgmltag>refentrytitle</sgmltag> is the name of the command, and the
	  content of <sgmltag>manvolnum</sgmltag> is the manual page
	  section.</para>

	<para>This can be cumbersome to write, and so a series of <link
	    linkend="sgml-primer-general-entities">general entities</link>
	  have been created to make this easier.  Each entity takes the form
	  <literal>&amp;man.<replaceable>manual-page</replaceable>.<replaceable>manual-section</replaceable>;</literal>.</para>

	<para>The file that contains these entities is in

	<para>Linking within the same document requires you to to specify
	  where you are linking from (i.e., the text the user will click, or
	  otherwise indicate, as the source of the link) and where you are
	  linking to (the link's destination).</para>

	<para>Each element within DocBook has an attribute called
	  <literal>id</literal>.  You can place text in this attribute to
	  uniquely name the element it is attached to.</para>

	  <para>This value will be used when you specify the link
	  source.</para>

	<para>Normally, you will only be linking to chapters or sections, so
	  you would add the <literal>id</literal> attribute to these
	  elements.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><literal>id on chapters and sections</literal></title>

	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<chapter id="chapter1">
  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This is the introduction.  It contains a subsection,
    which is identified as well.</para>

  <sect1 id="chapter1-sect1">
    <title>Sub-sect 1</title>

    <para>This is the subsection.</para>
  </sect1>
</chapter>]]></programlisting>
	</example>
	
	<para>Obviously, you should use more descriptive values.  The values
	  must be unique within the document (i.e., not just the file, but the
	  document the file might be included in as well).  Notice how the
	  <literal>id</literal> for the subsection is constructed by appending
	  text to the <literal>id</literal> of the chapter.  This helps to
	  ensure that they are unique.</para>

	<para>If you want to allow the user to jump into a specific portion of
	  the document (possibly in the middle of a paragraph or an example),
	  use <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag>.  This element has no content, but
	  takes an <literal>id</literal> attribute.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag></title>

	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<para>This paragraph has an embedded
  <anchor id="para1">link target in it.  It won't show up in
  the document.</para>]]></programlisting>
	</example>
	
	<para>When you want to provide the user with a link they can activate
	  (probably by clicking) to go to a section of the document that has
	  an <literal>id</literal> attribute, you can use either
	  <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> or <sgmltag>link</sgmltag>.</para>

	<para>Both of these elements have a <literal>linkend</literal>
	  attribute.  The value of this attribute should be the value that you
	  have used in a <literal>id</literal> attribute (it does not matter
	  if that value has not yet occured in your document, this will work
	  for forward links as well as backward links).</para>
	
	<para>If you use <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> then you have no control over
	  the text of the link.  It will be generated for you.</para>
	
	<example>
	  <title>Using <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Assume that this fragment appears somewhere in a document that
	    includes the <literal>id</literal> example;</para>
	  
	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<para>More information can be found
  in <xref linkend="chapter1">.</para>

<para>More specific information can be found
  in <xref linkend="chapter1-sect1">.</para>]]></programlisting>

	  <para>The text of the link will be generated automatically, and will
	    look like (<emphasis>emphasised</emphasis> text indicates the text
	    that will be the link);</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <para>More information can be found in <emphasis>Chapter
		One</emphasis>.</para>

	    <para>More specific information can be found in <emphasis>the
		section called Sub-sect 1</emphasis>.</para>
	  </blockquote>
	</example>
	
	<para>Notice how the text from the link is derived from the section
	  title or the chapter number.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>This means that you <emphasis>can not</emphasis> use
	    <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> to link to an <literal>id</literal>
	    attribute on an <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag> element.  The
	    <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag> has no content, so the
	    <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> can not generate the text for the
	    link.</para>
	</note>
	
	<para>If you want to control the text of the link then use
	  <sgmltag>link</sgmltag>.  This element wraps content, and the
	  content will be used for the link.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <sgmltag>link</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Assume that this fragment appears somewhere in a document that
	    includes the <literal>id</literal> example.</para>

	  <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [<para>More information can be found in
  <link linkend="chapter1">the first chapter</link>.</para>

<para>More specific information can be found in
  <link linkend="chapter1-sect1>this</link> section.</para>]]></programlisting>
	  
	  <para>This will generate the following
	    (<emphasis>emphasised</emphasis> text indicates the text that will
	    be the link);</para>
	  
	  <blockquote>
	    <para>More information can be found in <emphasis>the first

	    <para>More specific information can be found in
	      <emphasis>this</emphasis> section.</para>
	  </blockquote>
	</example>
	
	<note>
	  <para>That last one is a bad example.  Never use words like
	    &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;here&rdquo; as the source for the
	    link.  The reader will need to hunt around the surrounding context
	    to see where the link is actually taking them.</para>
	</note>

	<note>
	  <para>You <emphasis>can</emphasis> use <sgmltag>link</sgmltag> to
	    include a link to an <literal>id</literal> on an
	    <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag> element, since the
	    <sgmltag>link</sgmltag> content defines the text that will be used
	    for the link.</para>

	<title>Linking to documents on the WWW</title>

	<para>Linking to external documents is much simpler, as long as you
	  know the URL of the document you want to link to.  Use
	  <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag>.  The <literal>url</literal> attribute is
	  the URL of the page that the link points to, and the content of the
	  element is the text that will be displayed for the user to
	  activate.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

    <title>* LinuxDoc</title>
    
    <para>LinuxDoc is an adaptation of the QWERTZ DTD, first adopted by the

	Project</ulink>, and subsequently adopted by the FreeBSD Documentation
      Project.</para>
    
    <para>The LinuxDoc DTD contains primarily appearance related markup rather
      than content related markup (i.e., it describes what something looks
      like rather than what it is).</para>
    
    <para>Both the FreeBSD Documentation Project and the Linux Documentation
      Project are migrating from the LinuxDoc DTD to the DocBook DTD.</para>
    
    <para>The LinuxDoc DTD is available from the ports collection in the

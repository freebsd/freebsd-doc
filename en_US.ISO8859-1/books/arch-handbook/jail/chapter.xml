  <para>On most &unix; systems, <literal>root</literal> has omnipotent
    power.  This promotes insecurity.  If an attacker gained
    <literal>root</literal> on a system, he would have every function
    at his fingertips.  In FreeBSD there are sysctls which dilute the
    power of <literal>root</literal>, in order to minimize the damage
    caused by an attacker.  Specifically, one of these functions is
    called <literal>secure levels</literal>.  Similarly, another
    function which is present from FreeBSD 4.0 and onward, is a
    utility called &man.jail.8;.  <application>Jail</application>
    chroots an environment and sets certain restrictions on processes
    which are forked within the <application>jail</application>.  For
    example, a jailed process cannot affect processes outside the
    <application>jail</application>, utilize certain system calls, or
    inflict any damage on the host environment.</para>

  <para><application>Jail</application> is becoming the new security
    model.  People are running potentially vulnerable servers such as
    <application>Apache</application>,
    <application>BIND</application>, and
    <application>sendmail</application> within jails, so that if an
    attacker gains <literal>root</literal> within the
    <application>jail</application>, it is only an annoyance, and not
    a devastation.  This article mainly focuses on the internals
    (source code) of <application>jail</application>.  For information
    on how to set up a jail see the <link
      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/jails.html">handbook entry on
      jails</link>.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="jail-arch">
    <title>Architecture</title>

    <para><application>Jail</application> consists of two realms: the
      userland program, &man.jail.8;, and the code implemented within
      the kernel: the &man.jail.2; system call and associated
      restrictions.  I will be discussing the userland program and
      then how <application>jail</application> is implemented within
      the kernel.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Userland Code</title>

      <indexterm><primary>Jail</primary>
	<secondary>Userland Program</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>The source for the userland
	<application>jail</application> is located in
	<filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/jail</filename>, consisting of one
	file, <filename>jail.c</filename>.  The program takes these
	arguments: the path of the <application>jail</application>,
	hostname, IP address, and the command to be executed.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Data Structures</title>

	<para>In <filename>jail.c</filename>, the first thing I would
	  note is the declaration of an important structure
	  <literal>struct jail j;</literal> which was included from
	  <filename>/usr/include/sys/jail.h</filename>.</para>

	<para>The definition of the <literal>jail</literal> structure
	  is:</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/include/sys/jail.h</filename>:

struct jail {
        u_int32_t       version;
        char            *path;
        char            *hostname;
        u_int32_t       ip_number;
};</programlisting>

	<para>As you can see, there is an entry for each of the
	  arguments passed to the &man.jail.8; program, and indeed,
	  they are set during its execution.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/jail/jail.c</filename>
char path[PATH_MAX];
...
if (realpath(argv[0], path) == NULL)
    err(1, "realpath: %s", argv[0]);
if (chdir(path) != 0)
    err(1, "chdir: %s", path);
memset(&amp;j, 0, sizeof(j));
j.version = 0;
j.path = path;
j.hostname = argv[1];</programlisting>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Networking</title>

	<para>One of the arguments passed to the &man.jail.8; program
	  is an IP address with which the
	  <application>jail</application> can be accessed over the
	  network.  &man.jail.8; translates the IP address given into
	  host byte order and then stores it in <literal>j</literal>
	  (the <literal>jail</literal> structure).</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/jail/jail.c</filename>:
struct in_addr in;
...
if (inet_aton(argv[2], &amp;in) == 0)
    errx(1, "Could not make sense of ip-number: %s", argv[2]);
j.ip_number = ntohl(in.s_addr);</programlisting>

	<para>The &man.inet.aton.3; function "interprets the specified
	  character string as an Internet address, placing the address
	  into the structure provided." The
	  <literal>ip_number</literal> member in the
	  <literal>jail</literal> structure is set only when the IP
	  address placed onto the <literal>in</literal> structure by
	  &man.inet.aton.3; is translated into host byte order by
	  &man.ntohl.3;.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Jailing the Process</title>

	<para>Finally, the userland program jails the process.
	  <application>Jail</application> now becomes an imprisoned
	  process itself and then executes the command given using
	  &man.execv.3;.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/usr.sbin/jail/jail.c</filename>
i = jail(&amp;j);
...
if (execv(argv[3], argv + 3) != 0)
    err(1, "execv: %s", argv[3]);</programlisting>

	<para>As you can see, the <literal>jail()</literal> function
	  is called, and its argument is the <literal>jail</literal>
	  structure which has been filled with the arguments given to
	  the program.  Finally, the program you specify is executed.
	  I will now discuss how <application>jail</application> is
	  implemented within the kernel.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Kernel Space</title>

      <indexterm><primary>Jail</primary>
	<secondary>Kernel Architecture</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>We will now be looking at the file
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c</filename>.  This is
	the file where the &man.jail.2; system call, appropriate
	sysctls, and networking functions are defined.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Sysctls</title>

	<indexterm><primary>sysctl</primary></indexterm>

	<para>In <filename>kern_jail.c</filename>, the following
	  sysctls are defined:</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c:</filename>
int     jail_set_hostname_allowed = 1;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, set_hostname_allowed, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_set_hostname_allowed, 0,
    "Processes in jail can set their hostnames");

int     jail_socket_unixiproute_only = 1;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, socket_unixiproute_only, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_socket_unixiproute_only, 0,
    "Processes in jail are limited to creating UNIX/IPv4/route sockets only");

int     jail_sysvipc_allowed = 0;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, sysvipc_allowed, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_sysvipc_allowed, 0,
    "Processes in jail can use System V IPC primitives");

static int jail_enforce_statfs = 2;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, enforce_statfs, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_enforce_statfs, 0,
    "Processes in jail cannot see all mounted file systems");

int    jail_allow_raw_sockets = 0;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, allow_raw_sockets, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_allow_raw_sockets, 0,
    "Prison root can create raw sockets");

int    jail_chflags_allowed = 0;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, chflags_allowed, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_chflags_allowed, 0,
    "Processes in jail can alter system file flags");

int     jail_mount_allowed = 0;
SYSCTL_INT(_security_jail, OID_AUTO, mount_allowed, CTLFLAG_RW,
    &amp;jail_mount_allowed, 0,
    "Processes in jail can mount/unmount jail-friendly file systems");</programlisting>

	<para>Each of these sysctls can be accessed by the user
	  through the &man.sysctl.8; program.  Throughout the kernel,
	  these specific sysctls are recognized by their name.  For
	  example, the name of the first sysctl is
	  <literal>security.jail.set_hostname_allowed</literal>.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>&man.jail.2; System Call</title>

	<para>Like all system calls, the &man.jail.2; system call
	  takes two arguments, <literal>struct thread *td</literal>
	  and <literal>struct jail_args *uap</literal>.
	  <literal>td</literal> is a pointer to the
	  <literal>thread</literal> structure which describes the
	  calling thread.  In this context, <literal>uap</literal> is
	  a pointer to the structure in which a pointer to the
	  <literal>jail</literal> structure passed by the userland
	  <filename>jail.c</filename> is contained.  When I described
	  the userland program before, you saw that the &man.jail.2;
	  system call was given a <literal>jail</literal> structure as
	  its own argument.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c:</filename>
/*
 * struct jail_args {
 *  struct jail *jail;
 * };
 */
int
jail(struct thread *td, struct jail_args *uap)</programlisting>

	<para>Therefore, <literal>uap-&gt;jail</literal> can be used
	  to access the <literal>jail</literal> structure which was
	  passed to the system call.  Next, the system call copies the
	  <literal>jail</literal> structure into kernel space using
	  the &man.copyin.9; function.  &man.copyin.9; takes three
	  arguments: the address of the data which is to be copied
	  into kernel space, <literal>uap-&gt;jail</literal>, where to
	  store it, <literal>j</literal> and the size of the storage.
	  The <literal>jail</literal> structure pointed by
	  <literal>uap-&gt;jail</literal> is copied into kernel space
	  and is stored in another <literal>jail</literal> structure,
	  <literal>j</literal>.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c:</filename>
error = copyin(uap-&gt;jail, &amp;j, sizeof(j));</programlisting>

	<para>There is another important structure defined in
	  <filename>jail.h</filename>.  It is the
	  <literal>prison</literal> structure.  The
	  <literal>prison</literal> structure is used exclusively
	  within kernel space.  Here is the definition of the
	  <literal>prison</literal> structure.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/include/sys/jail.h</filename>:
struct prison {
        LIST_ENTRY(prison) pr_list;                     /* (a) all prisons */
        int              pr_id;                         /* (c) prison id */
        int              pr_ref;                        /* (p) refcount */
        char             pr_path[MAXPATHLEN];           /* (c) chroot path */
        struct vnode    *pr_root;                       /* (c) vnode to rdir */
        char             pr_host[MAXHOSTNAMELEN];       /* (p) jail hostname */
        u_int32_t        pr_ip;                         /* (c) ip addr host */
        void            *pr_linux;                      /* (p) linux abi */
        int              pr_securelevel;                /* (p) securelevel */
        struct task      pr_task;                       /* (d) destroy task */
        struct mtx       pr_mtx;
      void            **pr_slots;                     /* (p) additional data */
};</programlisting>

	<para>The &man.jail.2; system call then allocates memory for a
	  <literal>prison</literal> structure and copies data between
	  the <literal>jail</literal> and <literal>prison</literal>
	  structure.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c</filename>:
MALLOC(pr, struct prison *, sizeof(*pr), M_PRISON, M_WAITOK | M_ZERO);
...
error = copyinstr(j.path, &amp;pr-&gt;pr_path, sizeof(pr-&gt;pr_path), 0);
if (error)
    goto e_killmtx;
...
error = copyinstr(j.hostname, &amp;pr-&gt;pr_host, sizeof(pr-&gt;pr_host), 0);
if (error)
     goto e_dropvnref;
pr-&gt;pr_ip = j.ip_number;</programlisting>

	<para>Next, we will discuss another important system call
	  &man.jail.attach.2;, which implements the function to put a
	  process into the <application>jail</application>.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c</filename>:
/*
 * struct jail_attach_args {
 *      int jid;
 * };
 */
int
jail_attach(struct thread *td, struct jail_attach_args *uap)</programlisting>

	<para>This system call makes the changes that can distinguish
	  a jailed process from those unjailed ones.  To understand
	  what &man.jail.attach.2; does for us, certain background
	  information is needed.</para>

	<para>On FreeBSD, each kernel visible thread is identified by
	  its <literal>thread</literal> structure, while the processes
	  are described by their <literal>proc</literal> structures.
	  You can find the definitions of the
	  <literal>thread</literal> and <literal>proc</literal>
	  structure in <filename>/usr/include/sys/proc.h</filename>.
	  For example, the <literal>td</literal> argument in any
	  system call is actually a pointer to the calling thread's
	  <literal>thread</literal> structure, as stated before.  The
	  <literal>td_proc</literal> member in the
	  <literal>thread</literal> structure pointed by
	  <literal>td</literal> is a pointer to the
	  <literal>proc</literal> structure which represents the
	  process that contains the thread represented by
	  <literal>td</literal>.  The <literal>proc</literal>
	  structure contains members which can describe the owner's
	  identity(<literal>p_ucred</literal>), the process resource
	  limits(<literal>p_limit</literal>), and so on.  In the
	  <literal>ucred</literal> structure pointed by
	  <literal>p_ucred</literal> member in the
	  <literal>proc</literal> structure, there is a pointer to the
	  <literal>prison</literal>
	  structure(<literal>cr_prison</literal>).</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/include/sys/proc.h:</filename>
struct thread {
    ...
    struct proc *td_proc;
    ...
};
struct proc {
    ...
    struct ucred *p_ucred;
    ...
};
<filename>/usr/include/sys/ucred.h</filename>
struct ucred {
    ...
    struct prison *cr_prison;
    ...
};</programlisting>

	<para>In <filename>kern_jail.c</filename>, the function
	  <literal>jail()</literal> then calls function
	  <literal>jail_attach()</literal> with a given
	  <literal>jid</literal>.  And
	  <literal>jail_attach()</literal> calls function
	  <literal>change_root()</literal> to change the root
	  directory of the calling process.  The
	  <literal>jail_attach()</literal> then creates a new
	  <literal>ucred</literal> structure, and attaches the newly
	  created <literal>ucred</literal> structure to the calling
	  process after it has successfully attached the
	  <literal>prison</literal> structure to the
	  <literal>ucred</literal> structure.  From then on, the
	  calling process is recognized as jailed.  When the kernel
	  routine <literal>jailed()</literal> is called in the kernel
	  with the newly created <literal>ucred</literal> structure as
	  its argument, it returns 1 to tell that the credential is
	  connected with a <application>jail</application>.  The
	  public ancestor process of all the process forked within the
	  <application>jail</application>, is the process which runs
	  &man.jail.8;, as it calls the &man.jail.2; system call.
	  When a program is executed through &man.execve.2;, it
	  inherits the jailed property of its parent's
	  <literal>ucred</literal> structure, therefore it has a
	  jailed <literal>ucred</literal> structure.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_jail.c</filename>
int
jail(struct thread *td, struct jail_args *uap)
{
...
    struct jail_attach_args jaa;
...
    error = jail_attach(td, &amp;jaa);
    if (error)
        goto e_dropprref;
...
}

int
jail_attach(struct thread *td, struct jail_attach_args *uap)
{
    struct proc *p;
    struct ucred *newcred, *oldcred;
    struct prison *pr;
...
    p = td-&gt;td_proc;
...
    pr = prison_find(uap-&gt;jid);
...
    change_root(pr-&gt;pr_root, td);
...
    newcred-&gt;cr_prison = pr;
    p-&gt;p_ucred = newcred;
...
}</programlisting>

	<para>When a process is forked from its parent process, the
	  &man.fork.2; system call uses <literal>crhold()</literal> to
	  maintain the credential for the newly forked process.  It
	  inherently keep the newly forked child's credential
	  consistent with its parent, so the child process is also
	  jailed.</para>

	<programlisting><filename>/usr/src/sys/kern/kern_fork.c</filename>:
p2-&gt;p_ucred = crhold(td-&gt;td_ucred);
...
td2-&gt;td_ucred = crhold(p2-&gt;p_ucred);</programlisting>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="jail-restrictions">
    <title>Restrictions</title>

    <para>Throughout the kernel there are access restrictions relating
      to jailed processes.  Usually, these restrictions only check
      whether the process is jailed, and if so, returns an error.  For
      example:</para>

    <programlisting>if (jailed(td-&gt;td_ucred))
    return (EPERM);</programlisting>

    <sect2>
      <title>SysV IPC</title>

      <indexterm><primary>System V IPC</primary></indexterm>

      <para>System V IPC is based on messages.  Processes can send
	each other these messages which tell them how to act.  The
	functions which deal with messages are: &man.msgctl.3;,
	&man.msgget.3;, &man.msgsnd.3; and &man.msgrcv.3;.  Earlier, I
	mentioned that there were certain sysctls you could turn on or
	off in order to affect the behavior of
	<application>jail</application>.  One of these sysctls was
	<literal>security.jail.sysvipc_allowed</literal>.  By default,
	this sysctl is set to 0.  If it were set to 1, it would defeat
	the whole purpose of having a <application>jail</application>;
	privileged users from the <application>jail</application>
	would be able to affect processes outside the jailed
	environment.  The difference between a message and a signal is
	that the message only consists of the signal number.</para>

      <para><application>Jail</application> treats the &man.socket.2;
	system call and related lower-level socket functions in a
	special manner.  In order to determine whether a certain
	socket is allowed to be created, it first checks to see if the
	sysctl
	<literal>security.jail.socket_unixiproute_only</literal> is
	set.  If set, sockets are only allowed to be created if the
	family specified is either <literal>PF_LOCAL</literal>,
	<literal>PF_INET</literal> or <literal>PF_ROUTE</literal>.
	Otherwise, it returns an error.</para>

      <title>Protocols</title>

      <indexterm><primary>protocols</primary></indexterm>

      <para>There are certain protocols which are very common, such as
	TCP, UDP, IP and ICMP.  IP and ICMP are on the same level: the
	network layer 2.  There are certain precautions which are
	taken in order to prevent a jailed process from binding a
	protocol to a certain address only if the
	<literal>nam</literal> parameter is set.
	<literal>nam</literal> is a pointer to a
	<literal>sockaddr</literal> structure, which describes the
	address on which to bind the service.  A more exact definition
	is that <literal>sockaddr</literal> "may be used as a template
	for referring to the identifying tag and length of each
	address".  In the function
	<literal>in_pcbbind_setup()</literal>, <literal>sin</literal>
	is a pointer to a <literal>sockaddr_in</literal> structure,
	which contains the port, address, length and domain family of
	the socket which is to be bound.  Basically, this disallows
	any processes from <application>jail</application> to be able
	to specify the address that does not belong to the
	<application>jail</application> in which the calling process
	exists.</para>

      <para>You might be wondering what function
	<literal>prison_ip()</literal> does.
	<literal>prison_ip()</literal> is given three arguments, a
	pointer to the credential(represented by
	<literal>cred</literal>), any flags, and an IP address.  It
	returns 1 if the IP address does NOT belong to the
	<application>jail</application> or 0 otherwise.  As you can
	see from the code, if it is indeed an IP address not belonging
	to the <application>jail</application>, the protocol is not
	allowed to bind to that address.</para>

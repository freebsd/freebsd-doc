\titledframe{What is FreeBSD?}{
FreeBSD is a operating system used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its networking, security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.

\titledframe{Cutting edge features}{
FreeBSD offers advanced networking, performance, security and
compatibility features which are still missing in other
operating systems, even some of the best commercial ones.
}{5cm}
\titledframe{\textsf{\textbf{Powerful Internet solutions}}}{
FreeBSD includes a high performance networking stack
for network applications and the Internet.
FreeBSD makes an ideal Internet or Intranet server. It provides robust
network services under the heaviest loads and uses memory efficiently
to maintain good response times for thousands of simultaneous user
processes.

\titledframe{Run a huge number of applications!}{
FreeBSD comes with over 23000 third party software packages
ready to be installed including: Apache, Samba, MySQL\reg,
LibreOffice, KDE, GNOME, MPlayer, etc.
\medskip

FreeBSD provides the ports system which fetches sources
from the Internet and compiles binaries, including
building and installing any dependencies.  All these operations are
done in a transparent way for the user.  Compiled binaries
are also available.
\medskip

Most GNU/Linux binaries run under FreeBSD, for example:
Acrobat Reader\reg, Oracle\reg, Mathematica\reg, Quake3,
etc., without any noticeable speed degradation.

\titledframe{FreeBSD is easy to install}{
FreeBSD can be installed from a variety of media including a USB Stick,
CD-ROM, or even directly using FTP or NFS.
}{17.3cm}

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{FreeBSD is free}{
FreeBSD is available free of charge and comes with full source code.
The majority of the source code of the FreeBSD system is
available under the standard BSD license.  In contrast to the GPL
license used by the Linux kernel, the BSD license allows distribution
of derived work without accompanying source code.  This lets companies
use the FreeBSD code as the base of a proprietary product, often
leading to parts of what they do being released back to the community.
}{17.3cm}

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{Can handle nearly any task}{
FreeBSD is well-suited for a great number of desktop, server, embedded
or appliance applications.
Today, FreeBSD is not just a server operating system but
aims itself also at end users, particularly newcomers from Windows\reg
and GNU/Linux.

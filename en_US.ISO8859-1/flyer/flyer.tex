\begin{center}
\titledframe{What is FreeBSD?}{
FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for x86 compatible (Intel\reg
and AMD\tm), AMD64 (AMD Opteron\tm and Athlon\tm 64), DEC Alpha, IA-64
(Intel\reg Itanium\reg Processor Family), PC-98 and UltraSPARC\reg
architectures.  It is currently being ported to PowerPC\reg and MIPS
architectures.

FreeBSD is derived from BSD, the version of UNIX\reg
developed at the University of California, Berkeley.

\titledframe{Cutting edge features}{
FreeBSD offers advanced networking, performance, security and
compatibility features which are still missing in other
operating systems, even some of the best commercial ones.
}{5cm}
\titledframe{\textsf{\textbf{Powerful Internet solutions}}}{
FreeBSD includes what many consider the reference implementation for
TCP/IP software, the 4.4BSD TCP/IP protocol stack, thereby making it
ideal for network applications and the Internet.
FreeBSD makes an ideal Internet or Intranet server. It provides robust
network services under the heaviest loads and uses memory efficiently
to maintain good response times for thousands of simultaneous user
processes.
}{11cm}

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{Run a huge number of applications!}{
FreeBSD comes with over 10000 third party software packages
ready to be installed including: Apache, Samba, MySQL\reg,
OpenOffice.Org, KDE, GNOME, MPlayer, etc.\\

FreeBSD provides the ports system which fetches sources
and compiles binaries from the Internet or from a CD-ROM, including
building and installing any dependencies.  All these operations are
done in a transparent way for the user.\\

Most of GNU/Linux binaries run under FreeBSD, for example:
Acrobat Reader\reg, Oracle\reg, SAP/R3\reg, Mathematica\reg, Quake3,
etc., without any noticeable speed degradation.

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{FreeBSD is easy to install}{
FreeBSD can be installed from a variety of media including CD-ROM,
DVD-ROM, floppy disk, magnetic tape, an MS-DOS\reg
partition, or if you have a network connection, you can install it
directly using anonymous FTP or NFS.
}{17.3cm}

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{FreeBSD is free}{
FreeBSD is available free of charge and comes with full source code.
The majority of the source code of the FreeBSD system is
available under the standard BSD licence.  In contrast to the GPL
licence used by the Linux kernel, the BSD licence allows distribution
of derived work without accompanying source code.  This lets companies
use the FreeBSD code as the base of a proprietary product, often
leading to parts of what they do being released back to the community.

\vspace{5mm}

\titledframe{Can handle nearly any task}{
FreeBSD is well-suited for a great number of desktop, server, embedded
or appliance applications.
Today, FreeBSD is not just a server operating system but
aims itself also at end users, particularly newcomers from Windows\reg
and GNU/Linux.

$FreeBSD$

This directory holds slides for presentations about FreeBSD.

The common/ directory holds XML files each containing at least one
slide that are thought to be reusable across more than one
presentation.  Other presentations can simply use <xi:include> to pull
in the desired slides from the common directory.

The freebsd-general/ directory holds an example presentation that
includes general information about FreeBSD, including it's goals,
organization, and features.

Presentations from specific conferences or meetings can be added here
in the following format :

YYYYMMDD-eventname

or

YYYYMMDD-eventname-title

as required.

Building the slides requires the Slides stylesheets to be installed -
these are available from the textproc/slides port.

From within a presentation directory, simply type 'make' to build an
HTML version of the presentation.

PDF output is also supported, with 'make FORMATS=pdf'.

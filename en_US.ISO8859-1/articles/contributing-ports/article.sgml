    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Ports Collection is a perpetual work in progress.  We
      want to provide our users with an easy to use, up to date, high
      quality repository of third party software.  We need people to
      donate some of their time and effort to help us achieve this
      goal.</para>

    <para>Anyone can get involved, and there are lots of different
      ways to do so.  Contributing to ports is an excellent way to
      help <quote>give&nbsp;back</quote> something to the project.  Whether you are
      looking for an ongoing role, or a fun challenge for a rainy day,
      we would love to have your help!</para>

    <para>As a volunteer, what you do is limited only by what you want
      to do.  However, we do ask that you are aware of what other
      members of the &os; community will expect of you.  You may want
      to take this into account before deciding to volunteer.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="what-contribute">
    <title>What you can do to help</title>

    <para>There are a number of easy ways you can contribute to
      keeping the ports tree up to date and in good working order:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Find some cool or useful software and

	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you have created or adopted a port, be
	  aware of <link linkend="maintain-port">what you need to do

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="create-port">
    <title>Creating a new port</title>

    <para>There is a separate document available to help guide you
      through creating (and upgrading) a port called the
      <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's Handbook</ulink>.
      The Porter's Handbook is the best reference to working with
      the ports system.  It provides details about how the ports
      system operates and discusses recommended practices.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="adopt-port">
    <title>Adopting an unmaintained port</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Choosing an unmaintained port</title>

      <para>Taking over maintainership of ports that are
	unmaintained is a great way to get involved.  Unmaintained
	ports are only updated and fixed when somebody volunteers to
	work on them.  There are a large number of unmaintained
	ports.  It is a good idea to start with adopting a port that
	you use regularly.</para>

      <para>Unmaintained ports have their <makevar>MAINTAINER</makevar>
	set to <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>. A list of
	unmaintained ports and their current errors and problem
	reports can be seen at the
	<ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portsconcordanceformaintainer.py?maintainer=ports%40FreeBSD.org">&os; Ports Monitoring System</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>Some ports affect a large number of others due to
	dependencies and slave port relationships.  Generally, we
	want people to have some experience before they maintain such
	ports.</para>

      <para>You can find out whether or not a port has dependencies
	or slave ports by looking at a master index of ports called
	<filename>INDEX</filename>.  (The name of the file varies
	by release of &os;; for instance, <filename>INDEX-6</filename>.)
	Some ports have conditional dependencies that are not
	included in a default <filename>INDEX</filename> build.  We
	expect you to be able to recognize such ports by looking through
	other ports' <filename>Makefile</filename>s.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>How to adopt the port</title>

      <para>First make sure you understand your
	<link linkend="maintain-port">responsibilities as a
	maintainer</link>.
	Also read the
	<ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's Handbook</ulink>.
	<emphasis>Please do not commit yourself to more than you feel
	you can comfortably handle.</emphasis></para>

      <para>You may request maintainership of any unmaintained port
	as soon as you wish.  Simply set <makevar>MAINTAINER</makevar>
	to your own email address and send a PR (Problem Report) with
	the change.  If the port has build errors or needs updating,
	you may wish to include any other changes in the same PR.
	This will help because many committers are less willing to assign
	maintainership to someone who does not have a known track record
	with &os;.  Submitting PRs that fix build errors or
	update ports are the best ways to establish one.</para>

      <para>File your PR with category <literal>ports</literal> and
	class <literal>change-request</literal>.  A committer will
	examine your PR, commit the changes, and finally close the
	PR.  Sometimes this process can take a little while
	(committers are volunteers, too :).</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="maintain-port">
    <title>The challenge for port maintainers</title>

    <para>This section will give you an idea of why ports need to be
      maintained and outline the responsibilities of a port
      maintainer.</para>

    <sect2 id="why-maintenance">
      <title>Why ports require maintenance</title>

      <para>Creating a port is a once-off task.  Ensuring that a
	port is up to date and continues to build and run requires
	an ongoing maintenance effort.  Maintainers are the people
	who dedicate some of their time to meeting these goals.</para>

      <para>The foremost reason ports need maintenance is to bring
	the latest and greatest in third party software to the &os;
	community.  An additional challenge is to keep individual
	ports working within the Ports Collection framework as it
	evolves.</para>

      <para>As a maintainer, you will need to manage the following
	challenges:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>New software versions and updates.</title>

	    <para>New versions and updates of existing ported
	      software become available all the time, and these need
	      to be incorporated into the Ports Collection in order
	      to provide up-to-date software.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Changes to dependencies.</title>

	    <para>If significant changes are made to the dependencies
	      of your port, it may need to be updated so that it will
	      continue to work correctly.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Changes affecting dependent ports.</title>

	    <para>If other ports depend on a port that you maintain,
	      changes to your port may require coordination with
	      other maintainers.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Interaction with other users, maintainers and
	      developers.</title>

	    <para>Part of being a maintainer is taking on a support
	      role.  You are not expected to provide general support
	      (but we welcome it if you choose to do so).  What you should
	      provide is a point of coordination for &os;-specific
	      issues regarding your ports.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Bug hunting.</title>

	    <para>A port may be affected by bugs which are specific
	      to &os;.  You will need to investigate, find, and fix
	      these bugs when they are reported.  Thoroughly testing
	      a port to identify problems before they make their way
	      into the Ports Collection is even better.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Changes to ports infrastructure and policy.</title>

	    <para>Occasionally the systems that are used to build
	      ports and packages are updated or a new recommendation
	      affecting the infrastructure is made.  You should be
	      aware of these changes in case your ports are affected
	      and require updating.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara>
	    <title>Changes to the base system.</title>

	    <para>&os; is under constant development.  Changes to
	      software, libraries, the kernel or even policy changes
	      can cause flow-on change requirements to ports.</para>

      <title>Maintainer responsibilities</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Keep your ports up to date</title>

	<para>This section outlines the process to follow to keep your
	  ports up to date.</para>

	<para>This is an overview. More information about upgrading a
	  port is available in the
	  <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">
	  Porter's Handbook</ulink>.

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <title>Watch for updates</title>

	    <para>Monitor the upstream vendor for new versions,
	      updates and security fixes for the software.
	      Announcement mailing lists or news web pages are useful
	      for doing this.  Sometimes users will contact you and
	      ask when your port will be updated.  If you are busy
	      with other things or for any reason just cannot update
	      it at the moment, ask if they will help you by
	      submitting an update.</para>

	    <para>You may also receive automated email from the
	      <literal>&os; Ports Version Check</literal> informing
	      you that a newer version of your port's distfile is
	      available.  More information about that system
	      (including how to stop future emails) will be provided
	      in the message.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Incorporate changes</title>

	    <para>When they become available, incorporate the changes
	      into the port.  You need to be able to generate a patch
	      between the original port and your updated port.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Review and test</title>

	    <para>Thoroughly review and test your changes:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>Build, install and test your port on as many
		  platforms and architectures as you can.  It is
		  common for a port to work on one branch or platform
		  and fail on another.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Make sure your port's dependencies are complete.
		  The recommended way of doing this is by installing
		  your own ports <application>tinderbox</application>.
		  See <link linkend="resources">resources</link>
		  for more information.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Check that the packing list is up to date.  This
		  involves adding in any new files and directories and
		  removing unused entries.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Verify your port using &man.portlint.1; as a
		  guide.  See <link linkend="resources">resources</link>
		  for important information about using
		 <application>portlint</application>.</para>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Consider whether changes to your port might
		  cause any other ports to break.  If this is the
		  case, coordinate the changes with the maintainers of
		  those ports.  This is especially important if your
		  update changes the shared library version; in this
		  case, at the very least, the dependent ports will
		  need to get a <makevar>PORTREVISION</makevar> bump
		  so that they will automatically be upgraded by
		  automated tools such as &man.portupgrade.1;.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Submit changes</title>

	    <para>Send your update by submitting a PR with an
	      explanation of the changes and a patch containing the
	      differences between the original port and the updated
	      one.  Please refer to
	      <ulink url="&url.articles.problem-reports;">Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports</ulink>
	      for information on how to write a really good PR.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>Please do not submit a &man.shar.1; archive of the
		entire port; instead, use &man.diff.1; <literal>-ruN</literal>.
		In this way, committers can much more easily see exactly
		what changes are being made.  The Porter's Handbook
		section on
		<ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;/port-upgrading.html">Upgrading</ulink>
		has more information.</para>
	    </note>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Wait</title>

	    <para>At some stage a committer will deal with your PR.
	      It may take minutes, or it may take weeks &mdash; so please
	      be patient.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Give feedback</title>

	    <para>If a committer finds a problem with your changes,
	      they will most likely refer it back to you.  A prompt
	      response will help get your PR committed faster, and
	      is better for maintaining a thread of conversation
	      when trying to resolve any problems.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>And Finally</title>

	    <para>Your changes will be committed and your port will
	      have been updated.  The PR will then be closed by the
	      committer.  That's it!</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Ensure your ports continue to build correctly</title>

	<para>This section is about discovering and fixing problems
	  that stop your ports from building correctly.</para>

	<para>&os; only guarantees that the Ports Collection works on
	  the <literal>-STABLE</literal> branches.  You should be
	  running <literal>5-STABLE</literal> or
	  <literal>6-STABLE</literal>, preferably the latter.  In
	  theory, you should be able to get by with running the latest
	  release of each stable branch (since the ABIs are not
	  supposed to change) but if you can run the branch, that is
	  even better.</para>

	<para>Since the majority of &os; installations run on
	  PC-compatible machines (what is termed the <literal>i386</literal>
	  architecture), we expect you to keep the port working on that
	  architecture.  However, as more and more people start using
	  the <literal>amd64</literal> architecture running native, it is
	  going to be more and more important to make sure that ports run
	  there as well.  It is completely fair to ask for help if you
	  do not have one of these machines.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The usual failure modes for non-<literal>i386</literal>
	    machines are that the original programmers assumed that, for
	    instance, pointers are <literal>int</literal>s, or that the
	    relatively lax <application>gcc</application>&nbsp;2.95 compiler
	    was being used.  More and more, application authors are
	    reworking their code to remove these assumptions &mdash;
	    but if the author is not actively maintaining their code,
	    you may need to do this yourself.</para>
	</note>

	<para>These are the tasks you need to perform to ensure your
	  port is able to be built:</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <title>Watch for build failures</title>

	    <para>Regularly check the automated ports building cluster,
	      <ulink url="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org">pointyhat</ulink>,
	      and the
	      <ulink url="http://www.portscout.org">distfiles scanner</ulink>
	      to see if any of the ports you maintain are failing to
	      build or fetch (see <link linkend="resources">resources</link>
	      for more information about these systems).  Reports of
	      failures may also come to you from other users or
	      automated systems via email.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Collect information</title>

	    <para>Once you are aware of a problem, collect information
	      to help you fix it.  Build errors reported by
	      <literal>pointyhat</literal> are accompanied by logs
	      which will show you where the build failed.  If the failure
	      was reported to you by a user, ask them to send you
	      information which may help in diagnosing the problem,
	      such as:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>Build logs</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>The commands and options used to build the
		  port (including options set in
		<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename>)</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>A list of packages installed on their system
		  as shown by &man.pkg.info.1;</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>The version of &os; they are running as
		  shown by &man.uname.1;<command> -a</command></para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>When their ports collection was last updated
		</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>When their <filename>INDEX</filename> file
		  was last updated</para></listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Investigate and find a solution</title>

	    <para>Unfortunately there is no straightforward process to
	      follow to do this.  Remember, though: if you are stuck,
	      ask for help!  The &a.ports; is a good place to start, and
	      the upstream developers are often very helpful.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Submit changes</title>

	    <para>Just as with updating a port, you should now
	      incorporate changes, review and test, submit your
	      changes in a PR, and provide feedback if required.
	    </para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Send patches to upstream authors</title>

	    <para>In some cases, you will have to make patches to
	      the port to make it run on FreeBSD.  Some (but not all)
	      upstream authors will accept such patches back into
	      their code for the next release.  If so, this may even
	      help their users on other BSD-based systems as well and
	      perhaps save duplicated effort.  Please consider sending
	      any applicable patches to the authors as a courtesy.
	    </para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Investigate bug reports and PRs related to your port
	</title>

	<para>This section is about discovering and fixing bugs.
	</para>

	<para>&os;-specific bugs are generally caused by assumptions
	  about the build and runtime environments that do not apply to
	  &os;.  You are less likely to encounter a problem of this
	  type, but it can be more subtle and difficult to diagnose.
	</para>

	<para>These are the tasks you need to perform to ensure your
	  port continues to work as intended:</para>

	<procedure>
	  <step>
	    <title>Respond to bug reports</title>

	    <para>Bugs may be reported to you through email via the
	      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	      GNATS Problem Report database</ulink>.  Bugs may
	      also be reported directly to you by users.</para>

	    <para>You should respond to PRs and other reports within
	      14 days, but please try not to take that long.  Try to respond
	      as soon as possible, even if it is just to say you need some
	      more time before you can work on the PR.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Collect information</title>

	    <para>If the person reporting the bug has not also provided
	      a fix, you need to collect the information that will
	      allow you to generate one.</para>

	    <para>If the bug is reproducible, you can collect most of
	      the required information yourself.  If not, ask the
	      person who reported the bug to collect the information
	      for you, such as:
	    </para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>A detailed description of their actions,
		  expected program behavior and actual behavior
		</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Copies of input data used to trigger the bug
		</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Information about their build and execution
		environment &mdash; for example, a list of installed
		packages and the output of &man.env.1;</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Core dumps</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Stack traces</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Eliminate incorrect reports</title>

	    <para>Some bug reports may be incorrect.  For example,
	      the user may have simply misused the program; or their
	      installed packages may be out of date and require
	      updating.  Sometimes a reported bug is not specific to
	      &os;.  In this case report the bug to the upstream
	      developers.  If the bug is within your capabilities to
	      fix, you can also patch the port so that the fix is
	      applied before the next upstream release.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Find a solution</title>

	    <para>As with build errors, you will need to sort out a fix
	      to the problem.  Again, remember to ask if you are
	      stuck!</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Submit or approve changes</title>

	    <para>Just as with updating a port, you should now
	      incorporate changes, review and test, and submit your
	      changes in a PR (or send a follow-up if a PR already
	      exists for the problem).  If another user has submitted
	      changes in the PR, you can also send a follow-up saying
	      whether or not you approve the changes.</para>
	  </step>
	</procedure>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Providing support</title>

	<para>Part of being a maintainer is providing support &mdash; not
	  for the software in general &mdash; but for the port and any
	  &os;-specific quirks and problems.  Users may contact you with
	  questions, suggestions, problems and patches.  Most of the
	  time their correspondence will be specific to &os;.</para>

	<para>Occasionally you may have to invoke your skills in
	  diplomacy, and kindly point users seeking general support to
	  the appropriate resources.  Less frequently you will encounter
	  a person asking why the <literal>RPM</literal>s are not up to date
	  or how can they get the software to run under Foo Linux.  Take the
	  opportunity to tell them that your port is up to date (if it
	  is, of course!), and suggest that they try &os;.
	</para>

	<para>Sometimes users and developers will decide that you are a
	  busy person whose time is valuable and do some of the work for
	  you.  For example, they might:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>submit a PR or send you patches to update your port,
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>investigate and perhaps provide a fix to a PR, or
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>otherwise submit changes to your port.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>In these cases your main obligation is to respond in a
	  timely manner.  The timeout for non-responsive maintainers is
	  14 days.  After this period changes may be committed
	  unapproved.  They have taken the trouble to do this for you;
	  so please try to at least respond promptly.  Then review,
	  approve, modify or discuss their changes with them as soon as
	  possible.</para>

	<para>If you can make them feel that their contribution is
	  appreciated (and it should be) you will have a better chance
	  persuading them to do more things for you in the future

    <title>Finding and fixing a broken port</title>

    <para>There are two really good places to find a port that needs
      some attention.</para>

    <para>You can use the
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">web interface</ulink>
      to the Problem Report database to search through and view unresolved
      PRs.  The majority of ports PRs are updates, but with a little
      searching and skimming over synopses you should be able to find
      something interesting to work on (the <literal>sw-bug</literal>
      class is a good place to start).
    </para>

    <para>The other place is the
      <ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/">&os; Ports Monitoring System</ulink>.
      In particular look for unmaintained ports with build errors and
      ports that are marked <makevar>BROKEN</makevar>.  It is OK to send
      changes for a maintained port as well, but remember to ask the
      maintainer in case they are already working on the problem.</para>

    <para>Once you have found a bug or problem, collect information,
      investigate and fix!  If there is an existing PR, follow up to
      that.  Otherwise create a new PR.  Your changes will be reviewed
      and, if everything checks out, committed.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="mortal-coil">
    <title>When to call it quits</title>

    <para>As your interests and commitments change, you may find that
      you no longer have time to continue some (or all) of your ports
      contributions.  That is fine!  Please let us know if you are no
      longer using a port or have otherwise lost time or interest in
      being a maintainer.  In this way we can go ahead and allow other
      people to try to work on existing problems with the port without
      waiting for your response.  Remember, &os; is a volunteer project,
      so if maintaining a port is no fun anymore, it is probably time to
      let someone else do it!</para>

    <para>In any case, the Ports Management Team (<literal>portmgr</literal>)
      reserves the right to reset your maintainership if you have not
      actively maintained your port in some time.  (Currently, this is
      set to 3 months.)  By this, we mean that there are unresolved
      problems or pending updates that have not been worked on during
      that time.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="resources">
    <title>Resources for ports maintainers and contributors</title>

    <para>The
      <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's Handbook</ulink>
      is your hitchhiker's guide to the ports system.  Keep it handy!
    </para>

    <para><ulink url="&url.articles.problem-reports;">Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports</ulink>
      describes how to best formulate and submit a PR.  In 2005 more
      than eleven thousand ports PRs were submitted!  Following this
      article will greatly assist us in reducing the time needed to
      handle your PRs.</para>

    <para>The
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
      Problem Report database</ulink>.</para>

    <para><ulink url="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/">Pointyhat</ulink>
      is the ports build cluster.  You can use Pointyhat to check port
      build logs across all architectures and major releases.</para>

    <para>The
      <ulink url="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD Ports Monitoring System </ulink>
      can show you cross-referenced information about ports such as
      build errors and problem reports.  If you are a maintainer you can
      use it to check on the build status of your ports.  As a
      contributor you can use it to find broken and unmaintained ports
      that need to be fixed.</para>

    <para>The
      <ulink url="http://www.portscout.org">FreeBSD Ports distfile scanner</ulink>
      can show you ports for which the distfiles are not fetchable.  You
      can check on your own ports or use it to find ports that need their
      <makevar>MASTER_SITES</makevar> updated.
    </para>

    <para>The ports <application>tinderbox</application> is the most
      thorough way to test a port through the entire cycle of installation,
      packaging, and deinstallation.  It features a command-line
      interface but also can be controlled via a web interface.
      Please see <filename>ports/ports-mgmt/tinderbox</filename>.
      More documentation is located at the
      <ulink url="http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com/">marcuscom tinderbox home page</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>&man.portlint.1; is an application which can be used to verify
      that your port conforms to many important stylistic and functional
      guidelines.  <application>portlint</application> is a simple
      heuristic application,  so you should use it <emphasis>only as a
      guide</emphasis>.  If <application>portlint</application> suggests
      changes which seem unreasonable,  consult the
      <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's Handbook</ulink> or
      ask for advice.</para>

    <para>The &a.ports; is for general ports-related discussion.  It is
      a good place to ask for help.  You can
      <ulink url="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo">subscribe, or
      read and search the list archives</ulink>.  Reading the archives of
      the &a.ports-bugs; and the &a.cvs-ports; may also be of interest.</para>

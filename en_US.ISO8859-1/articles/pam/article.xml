  <section xml:id="pam-intro">
    <title xml:id="pam-intro.title">Introduction</title>

    <para>The Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library is a
      generalized API for authentication-related services which allows
      a system administrator to add new authentication methods simply
      by installing new PAM modules, and to modify authentication
      policies by editing configuration files.</para>

    <para>PAM was defined and developed in 1995 by Vipin Samar and
      Charlie Lai of Sun Microsystems, and has not changed much since.
      In 1997, the Open Group published the X/Open Single Sign-on
      (XSSO) preliminary specification, which standardized the PAM API
      and added extensions for single (or rather integrated) sign-on.
      At the time of this writing, this specification has not yet been
      adopted as a standard.</para>

    <para>Although this article focuses primarily on FreeBSD 5.x,
      which uses OpenPAM, it should be equally applicable to FreeBSD
      4.x, which uses Linux-PAM, and other operating systems such as
      Linux and &solaris;.</para>

    <section xml:id="pam-definitions">
      <title xml:id="pam-definitions.title">Definitions</title>

      <para>The terminology surrounding PAM is rather confused.
	Neither Samar and Lai's original paper nor the XSSO
	specification made any attempt at formally defining terms for
	the various actors and entities involved in PAM, and the terms
	that they do use (but do not define) are sometimes misleading
	and ambiguous.  The first attempt at establishing a consistent
	and unambiguous terminology was a whitepaper written by Andrew
	G. Morgan (author of Linux-PAM) in 1999.  While Morgan's
	choice of terminology was a huge leap forward, it is in this
	author's opinion by no means perfect.  What follows is an
	attempt, heavily inspired by Morgan, to define precise and
	unambiguous terms for all actors and entities involved in
	PAM.</para>

	Primitives</title>

      <para>The PAM API offers six different authentication primitives
	grouped in four facilities, which are described below.</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>auth</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Authentication.</emphasis> This facility
	      concerns itself with authenticating the applicant and
	      establishing the account credentials.  It provides two
	      primitives:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.authenticate.3; authenticates the
		  applicant, usually by requesting an authentication
		  token and comparing it with a value stored in a
		  database or obtained from an authentication
		  server.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.setcred.3; establishes account
		  credentials such as user ID, group membership and
		  resource limits.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>account</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Account management.</emphasis> This
	      facility handles non-authentication-related issues of
	      account availability, such as access restrictions based
	      on the time of day or the server's work load.  It
	      provides a single primitive:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.acct.mgmt.3; verifies that the
		  requested account is available.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>session</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Session management.</emphasis> This
	      facility handles tasks associated with session set-up
	      and tear-down, such as login accounting.  It provides
	      two primitives:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.open.session.3; performs tasks
		  associated with session set-up: add an entry in the
		  <filename>utmp</filename> and
		  <filename>wtmp</filename> databases, start an SSH
		  agent, etc.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.close.session.3; performs tasks
		  associated with session tear-down: add an entry in
		  the <filename>utmp</filename> and
		  <filename>wtmp</filename> databases, stop the SSH
		  agent, etc.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>password</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Password management.</emphasis> This
	      facility is used to change the authentication token
	      associated with an account, either because it has
	      expired or because the user wishes to change it.  It
	      provides a single primitive:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>&man.pam.chauthtok.3; changes the authentication
		  token, optionally verifying that it is sufficiently
		  hard to guess, has not been used previously,
		  etc.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="pam-modules">
      <title xml:id="pam-modules.title">Modules</title>

      <para>Modules are a very central concept in PAM; after all,
	they are the <quote>M</quote> in <quote>PAM</quote>.  A PAM
	module is a self-contained piece of program code that
	implements the primitives in one or more facilities for one
	particular mechanism; possible mechanisms for the
	authentication facility, for instance, include the &unix;
	password database, NIS, LDAP and Radius.</para>

      <section xml:id="pam-module-naming">
	<title xml:id="pam-module-naming.title">Module Naming</title>

	<para>FreeBSD implements each mechanism in a single module,
	  named
	  <literal>pam_<replaceable>mechanism</replaceable>.so</literal>
	  (for instance, <literal>pam_unix.so</literal> for the &unix;
	  mechanism.)  Other implementations sometimes have separate
	  modules for separate facilities, and include the facility
	  name as well as the mechanism name in the module name.  To
	  name one example, &solaris; has a
	  <literal>pam_dial_auth.so.1</literal> module which is
	  commonly used to authenticate dialup users.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="pam-module-versioning">
	<title xml:id="pam-module-versioning.title">Module
	  Versioning</title>

	<para>FreeBSD's original PAM implementation, based on
	  Linux-PAM, did not use version numbers for PAM modules.
	  This would commonly cause problems with legacy applications,
	  which might be linked against older versions of the system
	  libraries, as there was no way to load a matching version of
	  the required modules.</para>

	<para>OpenPAM, on the other hand, looks for modules that have
	  the same version number as the PAM library (currently 2),
	  and only falls back to an unversioned module if no versioned
	  module could be loaded.  Thus legacy modules can be provided
	  for legacy applications, while allowing new (or newly built)
	  applications to take advantage of the most recent
	  modules.</para>

	<para>Although &solaris; PAM modules commonly have a version
	  number, they are not truly versioned, because the number is
	  a part of the module name and must be included in the
	  configuration.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="pam-chains-policies">
      <title xml:id="pam-chains-policies.title">Chains and
	Policies</title>

      <para>When a server initiates a PAM transaction, the PAM library
	tries to load a policy for the service specified in the
	&man.pam.start.3; call.  The policy specifies how
	authentication requests should be processed, and is defined in
	a configuration file.  This is the other central concept in
	PAM: the possibility for the admin to tune the system security
	policy (in the wider sense of the word) simply by editing a
	text file.</para>

      <para>A policy consists of four chains, one for each of the four
	PAM facilities.  Each chain is a sequence of configuration
	statements, each specifying a module to invoke, some
	(optional) parameters to pass to the module, and a control
	flag that describes how to interpret the return code from the
	module.</para>

      <para>Understanding the control flags is essential to
	understanding PAM configuration files.  There are four
	different control flags:</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>binding</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the module succeeds and no earlier module in the
	      chain has failed, the chain is immediately terminated
	      and the request is granted.  If the module fails, the
	      rest of the chain is executed, but the request is
	      ultimately denied.</para>

	    <para>This control flag was introduced by Sun in &solaris;
	      9 (&sunos; 5.9), and is also supported by
	      OpenPAM.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>required</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the module succeeds, the rest of the chain is
	      executed, and the request is granted unless some other
	      module fails.  If the module fails, the rest of the
	      chain is also executed, but the request is ultimately
	      denied.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>requisite</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the module succeeds, the rest of the chain is
	      executed, and the request is granted unless some other
	      module fails.  If the module fails, the chain is
	      immediately terminated and the request is denied.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><literal>sufficient</literal></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the module succeeds and no earlier module in the
	      chain has failed, the chain is immediately terminated
	      and the request is granted.  If the module fails, the
	      module is ignored and the rest of the chain is
	      executed.</para>

      <para>When a server invokes one of the six PAM primitives, PAM
	retrieves the chain for the facility the primitive belongs to,
	and invokes each of the modules listed in the chain, in the
	order they are listed, until it reaches the end, or determines
	that no further processing is necessary (either because a
	<literal>binding</literal> or
	<literal>sufficient</literal> module succeeded, or because a
	<literal>requisite</literal> module failed.)  The request is
	granted if and only if at least one module was invoked, and
	all non-optional modules succeeded.</para>

      <para>Note that it is possible, though not very common, to have
	the same module listed several times in the same chain.  For
	instance, a module that looks up user names and passwords in a
	directory server could be invoked multiple times with
	different parameters specifying different directory servers to
	contact.  PAM treat different occurrences of the same module
	in the same chain as different, unrelated modules.</para>

	<para>The traditional PAM policy file is
	  <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename>.  This file contains all
	  the PAM policies for your system.  Each line of the file
	  describes one step in a chain, as shown below:</para>

	<programlisting>login   auth    required        pam_nologin.so  no_warn</programlisting>

	<para>The fields are, in order: service name, facility name,
	  control flag, module name, and module arguments.  Any
	  additional fields are interpreted as additional module
	  arguments.</para>

	<para>A separate chain is constructed for each service /
	  facility pair, so while the order in which lines for the
	  same service and facility appear is significant, the order
	  in which the individual services and facilities are listed
	  is not.  The examples in the original PAM paper grouped
	  configuration lines by facility, and the &solaris; stock
	  <filename>pam.conf</filename> still does that, but FreeBSD's
	  stock configuration groups configuration lines by service.
	  Either way is fine; either way makes equal sense.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="pam-config-pam.d">
	<title xml:id="pam-config-pam.d.title">The
	  <filename>/etc/pam.d</filename></title>

	<para>OpenPAM and Linux-PAM support an alternate configuration
	  mechanism, which is the preferred mechanism in FreeBSD.  In
	  this scheme, each policy is contained in a separate file
	  bearing the name of the service it applies to.  These files
	  are stored in <filename>/etc/pam.d/</filename>.</para>

	<para>These per-service policy files have only four fields
	  instead of <filename>pam.conf</filename>'s five: the service
	  name field is omitted.  Thus, instead of the sample
	  <filename>pam.conf</filename> line from the previous
	  section, one would have the following line in
	  <filename>/etc/pam.d/login</filename>:</para>

<programlisting>auth    required        pam_nologin.so  no_warn</programlisting>

	<para>As a consequence of this simplified syntax, it is
	  possible to use the same policy for multiple services by
	  linking each service name to a same policy file.  For
	  instance, to use the same policy for the
	  <literal>su</literal> and <literal>sudo</literal> services,
	  one could do as follows:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /etc/pam.d</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s su sudo</userinput></screen>

	<para>This works because the service name is determined from
	  the file name rather than specified in the policy file, so
	  the same file can be used for multiple differently-named
	  services.</para>

	<para>Since each service's policy is stored in a separate
	  file, the <filename>pam.d</filename> mechanism also makes it
	  very easy to install additional policies for third-party
	  software packages.</para>

      <title xml:id="pam-config-breakdown.title">Breakdown of a
	Configuration Line</title>

      <para>As explained in <xref linkend="pam-config-file"/>, each
	line in <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> consists of four or
	more fields: the service name, the facility name, the control
	flag, the module name, and zero or more module
	arguments.</para>

      <para>The service name is generally (though not always) the name
	of the application the statement applies to.  If you are
	unsure, refer to the individual application's documentation to
	determine what service name it uses.</para>

      <para>Note that if you use <filename>/etc/pam.d/</filename>
	instead of <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename>, the service
	name is specified by the name of the policy file, and omitted
	from the actual configuration lines, which then start with the
	facility name.</para>

      <para>The facility is one of the four facility keywords
	described in <xref
	  linkend="pam-facilities-primitives"/>.</para>

      <para>Likewise, the control flag is one of the four keywords
	described in <xref linkend="pam-chains-policies"/>, describing
	how to interpret the return code from the module.  Linux-PAM
	supports an alternate syntax that lets you specify the action
	to associate with each possible return code, but this should
	be avoided as it is non-standard and closely tied in with the
	way Linux-PAM dispatches service calls (which differs greatly
	from the way &solaris; and OpenPAM do it.) Unsurprisingly,
	OpenPAM does not support this syntax.</para>

    <section xml:id="pam-policies">
      <title xml:id="pam-policies.title">Policies</title>

      <para>To configure PAM correctly, it is essential to understand
	how policies are interpreted.</para>

      <para>When an application calls &man.pam.start.3;, the PAM
	library loads the policy for the specified service and
	constructs four module chains (one for each facility.)  If one
	or more of these chains are empty, the corresponding chains
	from the policy for the <literal>other</literal> service are
	substituted.</para>

      <para>When the application later calls one of the six PAM
	primitives, the PAM library retrieves the chain for the
	corresponding facility and calls the appropriate service
	function in each module listed in the chain, in the order in
	which they were listed in the configuration.  After each call
	to a service function, the module type and the error code
	returned by the service function are used to determine what
	happens next.  With a few exceptions, which we discuss below,
	the following table applies:</para>

      called first, which makes more sense.

      Also note that the example in the paper calls setgid(),
      initgroups() and setuid() itself rather than rely on
      pam_setcred() to do it.

    <para>The following is a minimal implementation of &man.su.1;
      using PAM.  Note that it uses the OpenPAM-specific
      &man.openpam.ttyconv.3; conversation function, which is
      prototyped in <filename>security/openpam.h</filename>.  If you
      wish build this application on a system with a different PAM
      library, you will have to provide your own conversation
      function.  A robust conversation function is surprisingly
      difficult to implement; the one presented in <xref
	linkend="pam-sample-conv"/> is a good starting point, but
      should not be used in real-world applications.</para>

    <para>The following is a minimal implementation of
      &man.pam.unix.8;, offering only authentication services.  It
      should build and run with most PAM implementations, but takes
      advantage of OpenPAM extensions if available: note the use of
      &man.pam.get.authtok.3;, which enormously simplifies prompting
      the user for a password.</para>

    <title xml:id="pam-sample-conv.title">Sample PAM Conversation
      Function</title>

    <para>The conversation function presented below is a greatly
      simplified version of OpenPAM's &man.openpam.ttyconv.3;.  It is
      fully functional, and should give the reader a good idea of how
      a conversation function should behave, but it is far too simple
      for real-world use.  Even if you are not using OpenPAM, feel
      free to download the source code and adapt
      &man.openpam.ttyconv.3; to your uses; we believe it to be as
      robust as a tty-oriented conversation function can reasonably
      get.</para>

    <para>In preparation for the code freeze on
      a <literal>stable</literal> branch, several files need to be
      updated to reflect the release cycle is officially in
      progress.  These files are all relative to the top-most level of
      the stable branch:</para>

    <title>&os; <literal>BETA</literal> Builds</title>

    <para>Following the code slush, the next phase of the release
      cycle is the code freeze.  This is the point at which all
      commits to the stable branch require explicit approval from
      the &team.re;.  This is enforced by pre-commit hooks in the
      Subversion repository by editing
      <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename> to include
      a regular expression matching the &branch.stablex; branch for
      the release:</para>

    <programlisting>^/&branch.stablex;	re</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>There are two general exceptions to requiring commit
	approval during the release cycle.  The first is any change
	that needs to be committed by the Release Engineer in order
	to proceed with the day-to-day workflow of the release cycle,
	the other is security fixes that may occur during the release
	cycle.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Once the code freeze is in effect, the next build from the
      branch is labeled <literal>BETA1</literal>.  This is done by
      updating the <varname>BRANCH</varname> value in
      <filename>sys/conf/newvers.sh</filename> from
      <literal>PRERELEASE</literal> to
      <literal>BETA1</literal>.</para>

    <para>Once this is done, the first set of <literal>BETA</literal>
      builds are started.  Subsequent <literal>BETA</literal> builds
      do not require updates to any files other than
      <filename>sys/conf/newvers.sh</filename>, incrementing the
      <literal>BETA</literal> build number.</para>

    <title>Creating the &branch.relengx; Branch</title>

    <para>When the first <literal>RC</literal> (Release Candidate)
      build is ready to begin, the &branch.releng; branch is created.
      This is a multi-step process that must be done in a specific
      order, in order to avoid anomalies such as overlaps with
      <varname>__FreeBSD_version</varname> values, for example.  The
      paths listed below are relative to the repository root.  The
      order of commits and what to change are:</para>

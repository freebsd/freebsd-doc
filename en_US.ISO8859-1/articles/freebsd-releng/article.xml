    <title>Introduction to the &os; Release Engineering
      Process</title>

    <para>Development of &os; has a very specific workflow.  In
      general, all changes to the &os; base system are committed to
      the <literal>head/</literal> branch, which reflects the top of
      the source tree.</para>

    <para>After a reasonable testing period, changes can then be
      merged to the <literal>stable/</literal> branches.  The default
      minimum timeframe before merging to <literal>stable/</literal>
      branches is three (3) days.</para>

    <para>Although a general rule to wait a minimum of three days
      before merging from <literal>head/</literal>, there are a few
      special circumstances where an immediate merge may be necessary,
      such as a critical security fix, or a bug fix that directly
      inhibits the release build process.</para>

    <para>After several months, and the number of changes in the
      <literal>stable/</literal> branch have grown significantly, it
      is time to release the next version of &os;.  These releases
      have been historically referred to as <quote>point</quote>
      releases.</para>

    <para>In between releases from the <literal>stable/</literal>
      branches, approximately every two (2) years, a release will be
      cut directly from <literal>head/</literal>.  These releases
      have been historically referred to as <quote>dot-zero</quote>
      releases.</para>

    <para>This article will highlight the workflow and
      responsibilities of the &team.re; for both
      <quote>dot-zero</quote> and <quote>point</quote>'
      releases.</para>

    <para>Approximately two months before the start of the release
      cycle, the &team.re; decides on a schedule for the release.
      The schedule includes the various milestone points of the
      release cycle, such as freeze dates, branch dates, and build
      dates.  For example:</para>

    <note>
      <para>If the release is being created from an existing
	<literal>stable/</literal> branch, the <acronym>KBI</acronym>
	freeze date can be excluded, since the <acronym>KBI</acronym>
	is already considered frozen on established
	<literal>stable/</literal> branches.</para>
    </note>

    <para>After general agreement on the schedule, the &team.re;
      emails the schedule to the &os; Developers.</para>

    <para>It is somewhat typical that many developers will inform
      the &team.re; about various works-in-progress.  In some cases,
      an extension for the in-progress work will be requested, and
      in other cases, a request for <quote>blanket approval</quote>
      to a particular subset of the tree will be made.</para>

    <para>When such requests are made, it is important to make sure
      timelines (even if estimated) are discussed.  For blanket
      approvals, the length of time for the blanket approval should
      be made clear.  For example, a &os; developer may request
      blanket approvals from the start of the code slush until the
      start of the <literal>-RC</literal> builds.</para>

    <para>Depending on the underlying set of code in question, and
      the overall impact the set of code has on &os; as a whole, such
      requests may be approved or denied by the &team.re;.</para>

    <para>The same applies to work-in-progress extensions.  For
      example, in-progress work for a new device driver that is
      otherwise isolated from the rest of the tree may be granted
      an extension.  A new scheduler, however, may not be feasible,
      especially if such dramatic changes do not exist in another
      branch.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="releng-code-slush-freeze">
    <title>Freezing the &os; Source Tree</title>

    <para>This section describes the general procedures related
      to the <quote>code slush</quote> and <quote>code freeze</quote>
      during the &os; release cycle.</para>

    <para>This applies to both <literal>head/</literal> and
      <literal>stable/</literal> branches.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="releng-code-slush">
      <title>The Code Slush</title>

      <para>Approximately one month prior to the scheduled
	<quote>code slush</quote>, the &team.re; sends a reminder
	email to the &os; Developers.</para>

      <para>Although the code slush is technically not a hard freeze
	on the tree, the &team.re; requests that bugs in the existing
	code base take priority over new features.</para>

      <para>The code slush does not enforce commit approvals to the
	branch.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="releng-code-freeze">
      <title>The Code Freeze</title>

      <para>Approximately one week prior to the scheduled
	<quote>code freeze</quote>, the &team.re; sends a reminder
	email to the &os; Developers.</para>

      <para>The code freeze marks the point in time where all commits
	to the branch require explicit approval from the
	&team.re;.</para>

      <para>The &os; <application>Subversion</application> repository
	contains several hooks to perform sanity checks before any
	commit is actually committed to the tree.  One of these hooks
	will evaluate if committing to a particular branch requires
	specific approval.</para>

      <para>To enforce commit approvals by the &team.re;, the Release
	Engineer updates
	<filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>, and commits
	the change back to the repository.  Once this is done, any
	change to the branch must include an <quote>Approved
	  by:</quote> line in the commit message.</para>

      <para>The <quote>Approved by:</quote> line must match the second
	column in <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>,
	otherwise the commit will be rejected by the repository
	hooks.</para>

      <para>Starting with the &os;&nbsp;10.0-RELEASE cycle, the notion
	of <quote><literal>-ALPHA</literal></quote> builds was
	introduced.  Unlike the <literal>-BETA</literal> and
	<literal>-RC</literal> builds, <literal>-ALPHA</literal>
	builds are not included in the &os; Release schedule.</para>

      <para>The idea behind <literal>-ALPHA</literal> builds is to
	provide regular &os;-provided builds before the creation of
	the <literal>stable/</literal> branch.</para>

      <para>&os; <literal>-ALPHA</literal> snapshots should be built
	approximately once a week.</para>

      <para>For the first <literal>-ALPHA</literal> build, the
	<literal>BRANCH</literal> value in
	<filename>sys/conf/newvers.sh</filename> needs to be changed
	from <literal>CURRENT</literal> to <literal>ALPHA1</literal>.
	For subsequent <literal>-ALPHA</literal> builds, increment
	each <literal>ALPHA<replaceable>N</replaceable></literal>
	value by one.</para>

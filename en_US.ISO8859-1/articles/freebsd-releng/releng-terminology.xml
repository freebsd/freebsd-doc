    <title>The Code Slush</title>

    <para>Although the code slush is not a hard freeze on the tree,
      the &team.re; requests that bugs in the existing code base take
      priority over new features.</para>

    <para>The code slush does not enforce commit approvals to the
      branch.</para>

  <sect2 xml:id="releng-terms-code-freeze">
    <title>The Code Freeze</title>

    <para>The code freeze marks the point in time where all commits to
      the branch require explicit approval from the &team.re;.</para>

    <para>The &os; <application>Subversion</application> repository
      contains several hooks to perform sanity checks before any
      commit is actually committed to the tree.  One of these hooks
      will evaluate if committing to a particular branch requires
      specific approval.</para>

    <para>To enforce commit approvals by the &team.re;, the Release
      Engineer updates
      <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>, and commits
      the change back to the repository.  Once this is done, any
      change to the branch must include an <quote>Approved by:</quote>
      line in the commit message.</para>

    <para>The <quote>Approved by:</quote> line must match the second
      column in <filename>base/svnadmin/conf/approvers</filename>,
      otherwise the commit will be rejected by the repository
      hooks.</para>

    <note>
      <para>During the code freeze, &os; committers are urged to
	follow the <link

	  Request Guidelines</link>.</para>

      Freeze</title>

    <para><acronym>KBI</acronym>/<acronym>KPI</acronym> stability
      implies that the caller of a function across two different
      releases of software that implement the function results in the
      same end state.  The caller, whether it is a process, thread, or
      function, expects the function to operate in a certain way,
      otherwise the <acronym>KBI</acronym>/<acronym>KPI</acronym>
      stability on the branch is broken.</para>

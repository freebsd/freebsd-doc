      made major contributions to FreeBSD, the best known of which is
      the import of the &man.dtrace.1; code.  John's unique sense of
      humor and plain-spokenness either ruffled feathers or made him
      quick friends.  At the end of his life, he had moved to a rural
      area and was attempting to live with as minimal impact to the
      planet as possible, while at the same time still working in the
      high-tech area.</para>

	Besan&ccedil;on</link> in Besan&ccedil;on, France.  While
      there, he participated in the conception and construction of the

      Jun-ichiro Hagino was a core researcher at the
      <link xlink:href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</link>,
      which aimed to provide IPv6 and IPsec technology in freely
      redistributable form.  Much of this code was incorporated into
      FreeBSD.  Without his efforts, the state of IPv6 on the Internet
      would be much different.</para>

      complete rewrite of our sound system during the late 1990s.

      help others.</para>

      <application>python</application>.  Alan's path was not an easy
      one but his passion for FreeBSD, and dedication to programming

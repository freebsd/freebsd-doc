	  made major contributions to FreeBSD, the best known of which
	  is the import of the &man.dtrace.1 code.  John's unique sense
	  of humor and plain-spokenness either ruffled feathers or
	  made him quick friends. At the end of his life, he had
	  moved to a rural area and was attempting to live with
	  as minimal impact to the planet as possible, while at
	  the same time still working in the high-tech area.</para>

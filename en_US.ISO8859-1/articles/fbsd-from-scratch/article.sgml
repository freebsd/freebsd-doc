    <abstract>
      <para>This article describes my efforts at &scratch.ap;: a fully
        automated installation of a customized &os; system compiled from
        source, including compilation of all your favorite ports and
        configured to match your idea of the perfect system.  If you
        think <command>make world</command> is a wonderful concept,
        &scratch.ap; extends it to <command>make evenmore</command>.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Have you ever upgraded your system with <command>make world</command>?
      There is a problem if you have only one system on your disks.  If
      the <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> fails partway through,
      you are left with a broken system that might not even boot any
      longer.  Or maybe the <maketarget>installworld</maketarget> runs
      smoothly but the new kernel does not boot.  Then it is time to
      reach for the Fixit CD and dig for those backups you have taken
      half a year ago.</para>

    <para>I believe in the <quote>wipe your disks when upgrading systems</quote>
      paradigm.  Wiping disks, or rather partitions, makes sure there is no
      old cruft left lying around, something which most upgrade procedures
      just do not care about.  But wiping the partitions means you have to
      also recompile/reinstall all your ports and packages and then
      redo all your carefully crafted configuration tweaks.
      If you think that this task should be automated as well, read on.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="why">
    <title>Why would I (not) want &scratch.ap;?</title>

    <para>This is a legitimate question.  We have
      <application>sysinstall</application> and the well known way to
      compile the kernel and the userland tools.</para>

    <para>The problem with <application>sysinstall</application> is
      that it is severely limited in what, where and how it can install.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is normally used to install pre-built distribution sets and
          packages from some other source (CD, DVD, FTP).  It cannot install
          the result of a <literal>make buildworld</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It cannot install a second system under a directory
          in a running system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It cannot install in <application>Vinum</application>
          partitions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It cannot compile ports, only install precompiled packages.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It is hard to script or to make arbitrary post-installation
          changes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Last but not least, <application>sysinstall</application>
          is semi-officially at its End-Of-Life.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The well known way to build and install the world, as
      described in <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html">the
      Handbook</ulink>, by default replaces
      the existing system.  Only the kernel and modules are saved.
      System binaries, headers and a lot of other files are overwritten;
      obsolete files are still present and can cause surprises.  If the
      upgrade fails for any reason, it may be hard or even impossible to
      restore the previous state of the system.</para>

    <para>&scratch.ap; solves all these problems.  The strategy is
      simple: use a running system to install a new system under an empty
      directory tree, while new partitions are mounted appropriately
      in that tree.  Many config files can be copied to the appropriate
      place and &man.mergemaster.8; can take care of those that cannot.
      Arbitrary post-configuration of the new system can be
      done from within the old system, up to the point where you can
      chroot to the new system.  In other words, we go through three
      stages, where each stage consists of either running a shell
      script or invoke <command>make</command>:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><filename>stage_1.sh</filename>:
          Create a new bootable system under an empty directory and merge
          or copy as many files as are necessary.
          Then boot the new system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename>stage_2.sh</filename>:
          Install desired ports.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename>stage_3.mk</filename>:
          Do post-configuration for software installed in previous stage.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Once you have used &scratch.ap; to build a second system and
      found it works satisfactorily for a couple of weeks, you can then
      use it again to reinstall the original system.  From now on, whenever
      you feel like an update is in order, you simply toggle the
      partitions you want to wipe and reinstall.</para>

    <para>Maybe you have heard of or even tried <ulink
        url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</ulink>,
      or LFS for short.  LFS also describes how to build and install a
      system from scratch in empty partitions using a running system.
      The focus in LFS seems to be to show the role of each system
      component (such as kernel, compiler, devices, shell, terminal database,
      etc) and the details of each component's installation.
      &scratch.ap; does not go into that much detail.  My goal is to
      provide an automated and complete installation, not explaining all
      the gory details that go on under the hood when making the world.
      In case you want to explore &os; at this level of detail, start
      looking at <filename>/usr/src/Makefile</filename> and follow the
      actions of a <command>make buildworld</command>.</para>

    <para>There are also downsides in the approach taken by &scratch.ap;
      that you should bear in mind.</para>

      <!-- XXX: A nice idea would be to write stage_2.sh using a jail
           that runs into the newly installed world from stage_1.  Having
           properly set up a network address as the jail's primary IP
           address, it might even be possible to build ports in a chroot
           without uninstalling anything from the 'host' system.  But
           keep in mind that even jails run on the 'host' kernel. -->

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>While compiling the ports during stage two the system can
        not be used for its usual duties.  If you run a production server
        you have to consider the downtime caused by stage two.  The ports
        compiled by <filename>stage_2.conf.default</filename> below require
        about 4 hours to build on an AMD1800+ SCSI system with 10krpm disks
        and 1GB of RAM.  If you prefer to install packages instead of ports,
        you can significantly reduce the downtime to about 10 minutes.</para>

  <sect1 id="stage1">
    <title>Stage One: System Installation</title>

    <para>The first version of this article used a single shell script
      for stage one where all your customization had to be done by editing
      the script.  After valuable user feedback I have decided to
      separate the code and data in the scripts.  This allows to have
      different configuration data sets to install different systems
      without changing any of the code scripts.</para>

    <para>The code script for stage one is
      <filename>stage_1.sh</filename> and when run with exactly one
      argument, like</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>./stage_1.sh <replaceable>default</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>will read its configuration from
      <filename>stage_1.conf.default</filename> and write a log to
      <filename>stage_1.log.default</filename>.</para>

    <para>Further below you find my <filename>stage_1.conf.default</filename>.
      You need to customize it in various places to match your idea of the
      <quote>perfect system</quote>.  I have tried to extensively comment
      the places you should adapt.  The configuration script must provide
      four shell functions, <command>create_file_systems</command>,
      <command>create_etc_fstab</command>, <command>copy_files</command>
      and <command>all_remaining_customization</command> (in case it
      matters: this is also the sequence in which they will be called
      from <filename>stage_1.sh</filename>).

      <para>The points to ponder are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Partition layout.</para>

        <para>I do not subscribe to the idea of a single huge partition
          for the whole system.  My systems generally have at least
          one partition for
          <filename>/</filename>,
          <filename>/usr</filename> and
          <filename>/var</filename> with
          <filename>/tmp</filename> symlinked to
          <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.
          In addition I share the file systems for
          <filename>/home</filename> (user homes),
          <filename>/home/ncvs</filename> (&os; CVS repository replica),
          <filename>/usr/ports</filename> (the ports tree),
          <filename>/src</filename> (various checked out src trees) and
          <filename>/share</filename> (other shared data without the need
          for backups, like the news spool).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Luxury items.</para>

        <para>What you want immediately after booting the new system and
          even before starting stage two.  The reason for not simply
          chrooting to the new system during stage one and installing
          all my beloved ports is that in theory and in practice there
          are bootstrap and consistency issues: stage one has your old
          kernel running, but the chrooted environment consists of new
          binaries and headers.  If the new binaries use a new system
          call, these binaries will die with <literal>SIGSYS, Bad
          system call</literal>, because the old kernel does not have
          that system call.  I have seen other issues when I tried
          building <filename role="package">lang/perl5</filename>.</para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Before you run <filename>stage_1.sh</filename> make sure
      you have completed the usual tasks in preparation for
      <command>make installworld installkernel</command>, like:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>configured your kernel config file</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>successfully completed <command>make buildworld</command></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>successfully completed <command>make buildkernel
            KERNCONF=<replaceable>whatever</replaceable></command></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When you run <filename>stage_1.sh</filename> for the first
      time, and the config files copied from your running system to the
      new system are not up-to-date with respect to what is under
      <filename>/usr/src</filename>, <command>mergemaster</command> will
      ask you how to proceed.  I recommend merging the changes.  If you get
      tired of going through the dialogues you can simply update the files
      on your <emphasis>running</emphasis> system once (Only if this is an
      option.  You probably do not want to do this if one of your systems
      runs <literal>-STABLE</literal> and the other
      <literal>-CURRENT</literal>.  The changes may be incompatible).
      Subsequent <command>mergemaster</command> invocations will detect
      that the RCS version IDs match those under
      <filename>/usr/src</filename> and skip the file.</para>

    <para>The <filename>stage_1.sh</filename> script will stop at the
      first command that fails (returns a non-zero exit status) due to
      <command>set -e</command>, so you cannot overlook errors.  It will
      also stop if you use an unset environment variable, probably due
      to a typo.  You should correct any errors in your version of
      <filename>stage_1.conf.default</filename> before you go on.</para>

    <para>In <filename>stage_1.sh</filename> we invoke
      <command>mergemaster</command>.  Even if none of the files requires a
      merge, it will display and ask at the end</para>

    <screen>*** Comparison complete

Do you wish to delete what is left of /var/tmp/temproot.stage1? [no] <userinput>no</userinput></screen>

    <para>Please answer <literal>no</literal> or just hit
      <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  The reason is that <command>mergemaster</command>
      will have left a few zero sized files below
      <filename>/var/tmp/temproot.stage1</filename> which will be copied to the
      new system later (unless already there).</para>

    <para>After that it will list the files it installed, making use of
      a pager, &man.more.1; by default, optionally &man.less.1;:</para>

<screen>*** You chose the automatic install option for files that did not
    exist on your system.  The following were installed for you:
      /newroot/etc/defaults/rc.conf
      ...
      /newroot/COPYRIGHT

(END)</screen>

    <para>Type <keycap>q</keycap> to quit the pager.  Then you will
      be informed about <filename>login.conf</filename>:</para>

    <screen>*** You installed a login.conf file, so make sure that you run
    '/usr/bin/cap_mkdb /newroot/etc/login.conf'
    to rebuild your login.conf database

    Would you like to run it now? y or n [n]</screen>

    <para>The answer does not matter since we will run &man.cap.mkdb.1; in any
      case.</para>

    <para>Here is the author's <ulink
        url="stage_1.conf.default"><filename>stage_1.conf.default</filename></ulink>,
      which you need to modify substantially.  The comments give you
      enough information what to change.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Please pay attention to the &man.newfs.8; commands.
        While you can not create new file systems on mounted partitions, the
        script will happily erase any unmounted
        <filename>/dev/da0s1a</filename>, <filename>/dev/da0s1e</filename>
        and <filename>/dev/da2s1e</filename>.  This can be enough to ruin
        your day, so be sure to modify the device names.</para>

    <para>Other areas are prepared for configuration, but will not work
      until stage two is completed.  For example we have copied files to
      configure printing and X11.  Printing however is likely to need
      applications not found in the base system, like &postscript;
      utilities.  X11 will not run before we have compiled the server,
      libraries and programs.</para>

  <sect1 id="stage2">
    <title>Stage Two: Ports Installation</title>

    <note>
      <para>It is also possible to install the (precompiled)
        packages at this stage, instead of compiling ports.  In this case,
        <filename>stage_2.sh</filename> would be nothing more than a list of
        <command>pkg_add</command> commands.  I trust you know how to write
        such a script.  Here we concentrate on the more flexible and
        traditional way of using the ports.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The following <filename>stage_2.sh</filename> script is how I
      install my favorite ports.  It can be run any number of times and
      will skip all ports that are already installed.  It supports the
      <emphasis>dryrun</emphasis> option (<option>-n</option>) to just
      show what would be done.  You run it like <filename>stage_1.sh</filename>
      with exactly one argument to denote a config file, e.g.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>./stage_2.sh <replaceable>default</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>which will read the list of ports from
      <filename>stage_2.conf.default</filename>.</para>

    <para>The list of ports consists of lines with two or more space
      separated words: the category and the port, optionally followed by
      an installation command that will compile and install the port
      (default: <command>make install</command>).  Empty lines and lines
      starting with # are ignored.  Most of the time it suffices to only
      name category and port.  A few ports however can be fine tuned by
      specifying <command>make</command> variables, e.g.:</para>

    <programlisting>www mozilla make WITHOUT_MAILNEWS=yes WITHOUT_CHATZILLA=yes install
mail procmail make BATCH=yes install</programlisting>

    <para>In fact you can specify arbitrary shell commands, so you are
      not restricted to simple <command>make</command> invocations:</para>

    <programlisting>java linux-sun-jdk13 yes | make install
news inn-stable CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-uucp-rnews --enable-setgid-inews" make install</programlisting>

    <para>Note that the line for
      <filename role="package">news/inn-stable</filename> is an example
      for a one-shot shell variable assignment to
      <literal>CONFIGURE_ARGS</literal>.  The port
      <filename>Makefile</filename> will use this as an initial value
      and augment some other essential args.  The difference to
      specifying a <application>make</application> variable on the command line
      with</para>

    <programlisting>news inn-stable make CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-uucp-rnews --enable-setgid-inews" install</programlisting>

    <para>is that the latter will override instead of augment.  It depends on
      the particular port which method you want.</para>

    <para>Be careful that your ports do not use an interactive install, i.e.
      they should not try to read from stdin other than what you explicitly
      give them on stdin.  If they do, they will read the next line(s) from
      your list of ports in the here-document and get confused.  If
      <filename>stage_2.sh</filename> mysteriously skips a port or stops
      processing, this is likely the reason.</para>

    <para>Below is <filename>stage_2.conf.default</filename>.  A log file named
      <filename>LOGDIR/category+port</filename> is created for each port
      it actually installs.</para>

    <para>Download <ulink
        url="stage_2.conf.default"><filename>stage_2.conf.default</filename></ulink>.</para>

  <sect1 id="stage3">
    <title>Stage Three</title>

    <para>You have installed your beloved ports during stage two.  Some
      ports require a little bit of configuration.  This is what stage three,
      the post-configuration is for.  I could have integrated this
      post-configuration at the end of the <filename>stage_2.sh</filename>
      script.  However, I think there is a conceptual difference between
      installing a port and modifying its out-of-the-box configuration
      that warrants a separate stage.</para>

    <para>I have chosen to implement stage three as a
      <filename>Makefile</filename> because this allows easy selection of
      what you want to configure simply by running:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make -f stage_3.mk <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>As with <filename>stage_2.sh</filename> make sure you have
      <filename>stage_3.mk</filename> available after booting the new
      system, either by putting it on a shared partition or copying it
      somewhere on the new system.</para>

  <sect1 id="limitations">
    <title>Limitations</title>

    <para>The automated installation of a port may prove difficult if it
      is interactive and does not support <command>make BATCH=YES
        install</command>.  For a few ports the interaction is nothing more
      than typing <literal>yes</literal> when asked to accept some license.
      If such input is read from the standard input, we simply pipe the
      appropriate answers to the installation command (usually <command>make
        install</command>; this is how I deal with <filename
        role="package">java/linux-sun-jdk14</filename> in
      <filename>stage_2.conf.default</filename>).</para>

    <para>This strategy for example does not work for <filename
        role="package">editors/staroffice52</filename>, which requires that
      X11 is running.  The installation procedure involves a fair amount of
      clicking and typing, so it cannot be automated like other ports can.
      However the following workaround does the trick for me: first I
      create a staroffice package on the old system with</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/editors/staroffice52</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make package</userinput>
===>  Building package for staroffice-5.2_1
Creating package /usr/ports/editors/staroffice52/staroffice-5.2_1.tbz
Registering depends:.
Creating bzip'd tar ball in '/usr/ports/editors/staroffice52/staroffice-5.2_1.tbz'</screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>and during stage two I simply use:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add /usr/ports/editors/staroffice52/staroffice-5.2_1.tbz</userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>You should also be aware of upgrade issues for config files.
      In general you do not know when and if the format or contents of a
      config file changes.  A new group may be added to
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>, or <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>
      may gain another field.  All of this has happened in the past.  Simply
      copying a config file from the old to the new system may be enough
      most of the time, but in these cases it was not.  If you update a
      system the canonical way (by overwriting the old files) you are
      expected to use <command>mergemaster</command> to deal with changes
      where you effectively want to merge your local config with
      potentially new items.  Unfortunately, <command>mergemaster</command>
      is only available for base system files, not for anything installed
      by ports.  Some third party software seems to be especially designed
      to keep me on my toes by changing the config file format every
      fortnight.  To detect such silent changes, I keep a copy of the
      modified config files in the same place where I keep
      <filename>stage_3.mk</filename> and compare the result with a
      <application>make</application> rule, e.g. for
      <application>apache</application>'s <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
      in target <command>config_apache</command> with</para>

<programlisting>
@if ! cmp -s /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf httpd.conf; then \
    echo "ATTENTION: the httpd.conf has changed. Please examine if"; \
    echo "the modifications are still correct. Here is the diff:"; \
    diff -u /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf httpd.conf; \
fi
</programlisting>

    <para>If the diff is innocuous I can make the message go away with
      <command>cp /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
        httpd.conf</command>.</para>

    <para>I have used &scratch.ap; several times to update a
      <literal>5-CURRENT</literal> to <literal>5-CURRENT</literal>, i.e.
      I have never tried to install a <literal>5-CURRENT</literal> from
      a <literal>4-STABLE</literal> system or vice versa.  Due to the
      number of changes between different major release numbers I would
      expect this process to be a bit more involved.  Using &scratch.ap;
      for upgrades within the realm of <literal>4-STABLE</literal>
      should work painlessly (although I have not yet tried it.)  Users of
      <literal>4-STABLE</literal> may want to consider the following
      areas:</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you do not use the device file system, &man.devfs.5;, you
      may want to create devices for some of your hardware with
      &man.MAKEDEV.8; in <command>all_remaining_customization</command>.

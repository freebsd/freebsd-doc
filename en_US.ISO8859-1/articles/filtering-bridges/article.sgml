    <abstract>
      <para>For those of you who don't know, DSL differs from more traditional
        connectivity methods in that the "connectivity spigot" that comes
        out of the wall has no possibility for packet filtering.  If you get
        a T1 line or some such it will come with a router that can generally
        include a packet filter.  If you get ISDN or a dialup link, you also
        either have a software routing component (a PPP daemon, specifically)
        that can do some filtering or can be combined with a filter on the
        machine running the link.  But with DSL you only get a little white
        box with some Blinkenlights on it and an Ethernet port that takes
        your traffic back and forth from the Internet and nothing else (to
        some extent the same can be said of other mass-market high speed
        connectivity methods, like cable modems or high speed wireless links
        as well.  The same technique I plan to describe works just as well
        for them, or for any other technology that provides an Ethernet
        port with no filtering).</para>

    <title>Why use a filtering bridge?</title>

    <para>Bridging is not the only conceivable option.  It is possible to
    set up a two Ethernet machine as a router instead of a bridge.
    Where it is possible to do so, it is actually a better idea.
    Bridges run their interfaces in promiscuous mode, meaning they
    must process every packet presented to them.  The problem is
    that routers can only route traffic between different subnets.
    Also, subnets can only be made by by cutting an existing space in
    half or defining a new space that is typically unroutable (see
    <ulink url="ftp://nis.nsf.net/internet/documents/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</ulink>).
    This wastes half of the useful addresses (or at least puts
    them on the "wrong" side of the router -- the thing that is
    doing the packet filtering that makes the inside network safe).
    Using a bridge costs some CPU cycles, but makes all of the
    problems of adding a 2nd router go away.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-kernel">
    <title>Configuring a Kernel</title>
    
    <important>
      <para>After configuring and installing a kernel as shown here, you
	should carry out the other
	<link linkend="filtering-bridges-finalprep">final preperation</link>
	tasks <emphasis>before</emphasis> booting into your new kernel.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Adding bridging to a FreeBSD machine is not hard to do.  It means
      having 2 (or more, but we'll just use 2 here) Ethernet cards and adding
      a couple of lines to the kernel configuration.  Since May of 2000,
      RELENG_4 and -current have had bridging support for all Ethernet
      interfaces.  This does not mean that any Ethernet interface will work.
      For them to work, they have to support a working promiscuous mode for
      both reception and transmition -- that is, they have to be able to
      transmit Ethernet packets with any source address, not just their own.
      In order to get good throughput, the cards should also be PCI bus
      mastering cards. The best choices still are the Intel EtherExpress Pro
      100 cards, with 3com 3c9xx cards being second.</para>

    <para>So you will want to add the following to your kernel configuration
      file:</para>
    
    <programlisting>device fxp (or whatever is appropriate for the cards you're using)
options BRIDGE
options IPFIREWALL
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</programlisting>

    <para>Note that recent versions of FreeBSD support dynamically loading the
      IP Firewall code into the kernel.  You can't do this, however, with
      bridging, as the bridge code itself needs to interact with IPFIREWALL
      in a special way.</para>

    <para>It is also a good idea at this point to see if Luigi has updated
      versions of the bridge code available that are more recent than what is
      in the distribution.  As an example, 3.3-RELEASE comes with 981214, but
      as of this writing, the most up-to-date bridge code is 990810.  You can
      fetch the latest version from
      <ulink url="http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/">http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/</ulink>. You will want to fetch <filename>bridge.c</filename> and <filename>bridge.h</filename> and drop them into <filename>sys/net/</filename>.</para>

    <para>For instructions on how to build and install a new kernel, refer to
      the
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html">Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</ulink> section of the handbook</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-finalprep">
    <title>Final Preperation</title>

    <para>Before you boot the new kernel, you must make some preparations in
      <filename>rc.boot</filename> and <filename>rc.firewall</filename>. The
      default rule for the firewall is to drop all packets on the floor.  You
      will want to override this by setting up the 'open' firewall in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>. Put these lines in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to achieve this:</para>

<programlisting>firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_type="open"</programlisting>

    <para>There is one more thing that is necessary.  When running IP over
      Ethernet, there are actually two Ethernet protocols in use.  One
      is IP, the other is ARP.  ARP is used when a machine must figure out
      what Ethernet address coresponds to a given IP address.  ARP is not
      a part of the IP layer, since it only applies to IP when run over
      Ethernet.  The standard ipfirewall rule for the open firewall is</para>

    <programlisting>pass ip from any to any</programlisting>

    <para>but what about ARP?  If ARP is not passed, no IP traffic can flow at
      all.  But IPFIREWALL has no provisions for dealing with non-IP
      protocols, and that includes ARP.  Fortunately, a hackish extension was
      made to the ipfirewall code to assist filtering bridges.  If you set up
      a special rule for UDP packets from IP address
      <hostid role="ipaddr">0.0.0.0</hostid>, the UDP port number will be used
      to match the Ethernet protocol number for bridged packets. In this way
      your bridge can be configured to pass or reject non IP protocols. So add
      this line just below the two lines near the top of
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename> that deal with
      <devicename>lo0</devicename> (the ones that say that you should almost
      never change those two rules).</para>

    <programlisting>${fwcmd} add allow udp from 0.0.0.0 2054 to 0.0.0.0</programlisting>

    <para>This rule makes almost no sense at all from a normal perspective on
      IPFIREWALL, but the bridge code will use it to pass ARP packets without
      restriction (which you almost certainly want to do).</para>

    <para>Now you should be able to reboot your machine and have it act no
      differently than it did before.  There will be some new boot messages
      about bridging, but the bridging will not be enabled.  If there are any
      problems, you should try and sort them out at this point before
      proceeding.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-enabling">
    <title>Enabling The Bridge</title>
    
    <para>Next, you should do this:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl -w net.link.ether.bridge=1</userinput></screen>

    <para>At this point, the bridge should be enabled, and because of the
      previous changes to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the firewall
      should be wide open.  At this point, you should be able to insert the
      machine between two sets of hosts and go back and forth without
      difficulty.  If so, the next step is to add those two sysctl lines to
      either <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or add the net.link.[blah
      blah]=1 portions of the lines to <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>
      (which path you take depends on what version of FreeBSD you
      have).</para>

    <para>Now before we started all of this, you should have had a machine
      with two Ethernet interfaces, but with only one of them configured. That
      is, there should only be one ifconfig line
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  With the bridge in place, that is
      still true.  But there is a detail that deserves some thought.  The
      bridge is not in place by default.  That means that until the sysctls
      are run that turn the bridge on, rather late in the startup, it is still
      an ordinary machine with two interfaces, only one of which is configured
      by <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This becomes important for those
      portions of the startup that require network access, say for DNS
      resolution.  Some care must be made in picking which interface is going
      to be the configured one.  In most cases, you are best to pick the
      "outside" one (that is, the interface connected to the Internet).  Let's
      presume for the sake of the examples to come, that
      <devicename>fxp0</devicename> is the "outside" interface, and
      <devicename>fxp1</devicename> is the "inside" one.  That means that fxp0
      should be mentioned in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>'s ifconfig
      sections, but <devicename>fxp1</devicename> should not be.  The sysctl
      that turns the bridge on will make <devicename>fxp1</devicename> start
      working automagically.</para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-ipfirewall">
    <title>Configuring The Firewall</title>
    
    <para>Now it is time to start adding ipfirewall rules to secure the inside
      network.  There are some complications in doing this because not all of
      the ipfirewall functionality is available on bridged packets.  Also,
      there is a difference between packets that are in the process of being
      bridged and packets that are being received by the local machine.  In
      general, packets being bridged are only run through ipfirewall once, not
      twice as is usually the case.  Bridged packets are filtered while they
      are being received, so rules that use 'out' or 'xmit' will never match.
      I usually use 'in via' which is an older syntax, but one that makes
      sense as you read it.  Another limitation is that you are restricted
      only to 'pass' or 'drop' for filtering bridged packets.  Sophisticated
      things like 'divert' or 'forward' or 'reject' are not available. Such
      options can still be used, but only on traffic to or from the bridge
      machine itself.</para>

    <para>New in FreeBSD 4.0 is the concept of stateful filtering.  This is a
      big boost for UDP traffic, which typically is a request going out,
      followed shortly thereafter by a response with the exact same set of IP
      addresses and port numbers (but with source and dest reversed, of
      course).  For firewalls that have no statekeeping, there is almost no
      way to deal with this sort of traffic short of setting up proxies.  But
      a firewall that can "remember" an outgoing UDP packet and for the next
      few minutes allow a response, handling UDP services is trivial.  The
      example to follow shows how to do this.  The truly paranoid can also set
      up rules like this to handle TCP.  This allows you to avoid some sorts
      of denial of service attacks or other nasty tricks, but it also
      typically makes your state table mushroom in size.</para>

    <para>Let's look at an example setup.  Note first that at the top of
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename> we should already have taken care
      of the loopback interface and the special hack for ARP should still be
      in place.  So we won't worry about them any further.</para>

<programlisting>us_ip=192.168.1.1
oif=fxp0
iif=fxp1

# Things that we've kept state on before get to go through in a hurry.
${ipfw} add check-state

# Throw away RFC 1918 networks

# Pass SSH.

${ipfw} add pass udp from any to any 49152-65535 in via ${oif}
# Pass DNS.  Only if you have name servers inside.

# Everything else is suspect
${ipfw} add deny log ip from any to any</programlisting>

    <para>Those of you who have set up firewalls before may notice some things
      missing.  In particular, there are no anti-spoofing rules.  That is,
      we did <emphasis>not</emphasis> add:</para>

    <programlisting>${ipfw} add deny ip from ${us_ip}/24 to any in via ${oif}</programlisting>

    <para>That is, drop packets claiming to be from our network that are
      coming in from the outside.  This is something that you would commonly
      do to make sure that someone doesn't try and evade the packet filter by
      generating nefarious packets that look like they are from the inside.
      The problem with that is that there is at least one host on the outside
      interface that you do not want to ignore -- your router.  In my
      particular case, I have some machines on the outside and some on the
      inside, but I don't necessarily want the outside machines to have
      routine access to the inside.  At the same time, I don't want to throw
      their traffic away.  In my own case, my ISP anti-spoofs at their router,
      so I don't need to bother.  And in general, the fewer rules the better,
      since it will take time and CPU to process each one.</para>

    <para>Note also that the last rule is almost an exact duplicate of the
      default rule 65536.  There are two major differences when it comes to
      bridging, however.  Our rule logs what it drops, of course, but our rule
      will only apply to IP traffic.  Apart from the UDP
      <hostid role="ipaddr">0.0.0.0</hostid> trick there is no way to deal
      with non IP traffic, so the default rule at 65536 will drop ALL traffic,
      not merely all non-IP traffic.  So the net effect is that unmatched IP
      traffic will be logged, but not non-IP traffic.  If you want, you can
      add option <literal>IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT</literal> to your
      <link linkend="filtering-bridges-kernel">kernel configuration</link> and
      non-IP traffic will be passed instead of dropped.  But in the case of a
      filtering bridge between you and the Internet, it is unlikely that you
      would want to do this (if you are sufficiently paranoid).</para>

    <para>There is a rule for passing SMTP to a mailhost if you have one.
      Obviously the whole ruleset above should be flavored to taste, and
      that is an example of a specific service exemption.  Note that
      in order for 'mailhost' to work, name service lookups must work
      BEFORE the bridge is enabled.  This is an example of making sure
      that you enable the correct interface.</para>

    <para>Another item to note is that the DNS rules are set up only to
      allow DNS servers to work.  This means that if don't set up a
      DNS server, you don't need them.</para>

    <para>Folks used to setting up IP firewalls also probably are used to
      either having a 'reset' or a 'forward' rule for ident packets
      (TCP port 113).  Unfortunately, this is not an option with the
      bridging code, so the path of least resistance is to simply pass
      them to their destination.  As long as that destination machine
      isn't running an ident daemon, this is relatively harmless.
      The alternative is dropping port 113 connections, which makes
      firing up things like IRC take forever (the ident probe must
      timeout).</para>

    <para>The only other thing that's a little weird that you may have noticed
      is that there is a rule to let ${us_ip} speak and a separate rule to
      allow the inside network to speak.  Remember that this is because the
      two sets of traffic will be taking different paths through the kernel
      and into the packet filter.  The inside net will be going through the
      bridge code.  The local machine, however, will be using the normal IP
      stack to speak.  Thus the two rules to handle the different cases.  The
      in via ${oif} rules work for both paths.  In general if you use in via
      rules throughout the filter, you will need to make an exception for
      locally generated packets, because they didn't "come in" via
      anything.</para>

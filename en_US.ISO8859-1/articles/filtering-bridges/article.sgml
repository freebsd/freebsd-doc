      <para>Often it is useful to divide one physical network (like an
	Ethernet) into two separate segments without having to create subnets,
	and use a router to link them together. The device that connects the
	two networks in this way is called a bridge.  A FreeBSD system with
	two network interfaces is enough in order to act as a bridge.</para>

      <para>A bridge works by scanning the addresses of <acronym>MAC</acronym>
	level (Ethernet addresses) of the devices connected to each of its
	network interfaces and then forwarding the traffic between the two
	networks only if the source and the destination are on different
	segments. Under many points of view a bridge is similar to an Ethernet
	switch with only two ports.</para>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-why">
    <title>Why use a filtering bridge?</title>

    <para>More and more frequently, thanks to the lowering costs of broad band
      Internet connections (xDSL) and also because of the reduction of
      available IPv4 addresses, many companies are connected to the Internet
      24 hours on 24 and with few (sometimes not even a power of 2) IP
      addresses. In these situations it is often desirable to have a firewall
      that filters incoming and outgoing traffic from and towards Internet,
      but a packet filtering solution based on router may not be applicable,
      either due to subnetting issues, the router is owned by the connectivity
      supplier (<acronym>ISP</acronym>), or because it does not support such
      functionalities. In these scenarios the use of a filtering bridge is
      highly advised.</para>

    <para>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and inserted between the
      xDSL router and your Ethernet hub/switch without any IP numbering
      issues.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-how">
    <title>How to Install</title>

    <para>Adding bridge functionalities to a FreeBSD system is not difficult.
      Since 4.5 release it is possible to load such functionalities as modules
      instead of having to rebuild the kernel, simplifying the procedure a
      great deal. In the following subsections I will explain both
      installation ways.</para>

    <important>
      <para><emphasis>Do not</emphasis> follow both instructions: a procedure
	<emphasis>excludes</emphasis> the other one.  Select the best choice
	according to your needs and abilities.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Before going on, be sure to have at least two Ethernet cards that
      support the promiscuous mode for both reception and transmission, since
      they must be able to send Ethernet packets with any address, not just
      their own. Moreover, to have a good throughput, the cards should be PCI
      bus mastering cards. The best choices are still the Intel &etherexpress;
      Pro, followed by the &tm.3com; 3c9xx series. To simplify the firewall
      configuration it may be useful to have two cards of different
      manufacturers (using different drivers) in order to distinguish clearly
      which interface is connected to the router and which to the inner
      network.</para>

    <sect2 id="filtering-bridges-kernel">
      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

      <para>So you have decided to use the older but well tested installation
	method. To begin, you have to add the following rows to your kernel
	configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>options BRIDGE
options IPFIREWALL
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</programlisting>

      <para>The first line is to compile the bridge support, the second one is
	the firewall and the third one is the logging functions of the
	firewall.</para>

      <para>Now it is necessary to build and install the new kernel.  You may
	find detailed instructions in the <ulink
	  url="../../books/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html">Building
	and Installing a Custom Kernel</ulink> section of the FreeBSD
	Handbook.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="filtering-bridges-modules">
      <title>Modules Loading</title>

      <para>If you have chosen to use the new and simpler installation
	method, the only thing to do now is add the following row to
        <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>bridge_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>In this way, during the system startup, the
	<filename>bridge.ko</filename> module will be loaded together with the
	kernel. It is not required to add a similar row for the
	<filename>ipfw.ko</filename> module, since it will be loaded
	automatically after the execution of the steps in the following
	section.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-finalprep">
    <title>Final Preparation</title>

    <para>Before rebooting in order to load the new kernel or the required
      modules (according to the previously chosen installation method), you
      have to make some changes to the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
      configuration file. The default rule of the firewall is to reject all IP
      packets.  Initially we will set up an <option>open</option> firewall, in order to verify
      its operation without any issue related to packet filtering (in case you
      are going to execute this procedure remotely, such configuration will
      avoid you to remain isolated from the network). Put these lines in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_type="open"
firewall_quiet="YES"
firewall_logging="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>The first row will enable the firewall (and will load the module
      <filename>ipfw.ko</filename> if it is not compiled in the kernel), the
      second one to set up it in <option>open</option> mode (as explained in
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename>), the third one to not show rules
      loading and the fourth one to enable logging support.</para>

    <para>About the configuration of the network interfaces, the most used way
      is to assign an IP to only one of the network cards, but the bridge will
      work equally even if both interfaces or none has a configured IP. In the
      last case (IP-less) the bridge machine will be still more hidden, as
      inaccessible from the network: to configure it, you have to login from
      console or through a third network interface separated from the bridge.
      Sometimes, during the system startup, some programs require network
      access, say for domain resolution: in this case it is necessary to
      assign an IP to the external interface (the one connected to Internet,
      where <acronym>DNS</acronym> server resides), since the bridge will be
      activated at the end of the startup procedure. It means that the
      <devicename>fxp0</devicename> interface (in our case) must be mentioned
      in the ifconfig section of the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file,
      while the <devicename>xl0</devicename> is not. Assigning an IP to both
      the network cards does not make much sense, unless, during the start
      procedure, applications should access to services on both Ethernet
      segments.</para>

    <para>There is another important thing to know. When running IP over
      Ethernet, there are actually two Ethernet protocols in use: one is IP,
      the other is <acronym>ARP</acronym>.  <acronym>ARP</acronym> does the
      conversion of the IP address of a host into its Ethernet address
      (<acronym>MAC</acronym> layer).  In order to allow the communication
      between two hosts separated by the bridge, it is necessary that the
      bridge will forward <acronym>ARP</acronym> packets. Such protocol is not
      included in the IP layer, since it exists only with IP over Ethernet.
      The FreeBSD firewall filters exclusively on the IP layer and therefore
      all non-IP packets (<acronym>ARP</acronym> included) will be forwarded
      without being filtered, even if the firewall is configured to not permit
      anything.</para>

    <para>Now it is time to reboot the system and use it as before: there will
      be some new messages about the bridge and the firewall, but the bridge
      will not be activated and the firewall, being in <option>open</option> mode, will not
      avoid any operations.</para>

    <para>If there are any problems, you should sort them out now
      before proceeding.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-enabling">
    <title>Enabling the Bridge</title>

    <para>At this point, to enable the bridge, you have to execute the
      following commands (having the shrewdness to replace the names of the
      two network interfaces <devicename>fxp0</devicename> and
      <devicename>xl0</devicename> with your own ones):</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.config=fxp0:0,xl0:0</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.ipfw=1</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</userinput></screen>

    <para>The first row specifies which interfaces should be activated by the
      bridge, the second one will enable the firewall on the bridge and
      finally the third one will enable the bridge.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you have &os;&nbsp;5.1-RELEASE or previous the sysctl variables
	are spelled differently.  See &man.bridge.4; for details.</para>
    </note>

    <para>At this point you should be able to insert the machine between two
      sets of hosts without compromising any communication abilities between
      them. If so, the next step is to add the
      <literal>net.link.ether.bridge.<replaceable>[blah]</replaceable>=<replaceable>[blah]</replaceable></literal>
      portions of these rows to the <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>
      file, in order to have them execute at startup.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="filtering-bridges-ipfirewall">
    <title>Configuring The Firewall</title>

    <para>Now it is time to create your own file with custom firewall rules,
      in order to secure the inside network. There will be some complication
      in doing this because not all of the firewall functionalities are
      available on bridged packets. Furthermore, there is a difference between
      the packets that are in the process of being forwarded and packets that
      are being received by the local machine. In general, incoming packets
      are run through the firewall only once, not twice as is normally the
      case; in fact they are filtered only upon receipt, so rules that use
      <option>out</option> or <option>xmit</option> will never match. Personally, I use <option>in via</option> which is an
      older syntax, but one that has a sense when you read it. Another
      limitation is that you are restricted to use only <option>pass</option> or <option>drop</option>
      commands for packets filtered by a bridge.  Sophisticated things like
      <option>divert</option>, <option>forward</option> or <option>reject</option> are not available. Such options can
      still be used, but only on traffic to or from the bridge machine itself
      (if it has an IP address).</para>

    <para>New in FreeBSD 4.0, is the concept of stateful filtering.  This is a
      big improvement for <acronym>UDP</acronym> traffic, which typically is a
      request going out, followed shortly thereafter by a response with the
      exact same set of IP addresses and port numbers (but with source and
      destination reversed, of course). For firewalls that have no
      statekeeping, there is almost no way to deal with this sort of traffic
      as a single session. But with a firewall that can <quote>remember</quote> an outgoing
      <acronym>UDP</acronym> packet and, for the next few minutes, allow a
      response, handling <acronym>UDP</acronym> services is trivial. The
      following example shows how to do it. It is possible to do the same thing
      with <acronym>TCP</acronym> packets. This allows you to avoid some
      denial of service attacks and other nasty tricks, but it also typically
      makes your state table grow quickly in size.</para>

    <para>Let's look at an example setup. Note first that at the top of
      <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename> there are already standard rules
      for the loopback interface <devicename>lo0</devicename>, so we should not
      have to care for them anymore. Custom rules should be put in a separate
      file (say <filename>/etc/rc.firewall.local</filename>) and loaded at
      system startup, by modifying the row of
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> where we defined the <option>open</option>
      firewall:</para>

    <programlisting>firewall_type="/etc/rc.firewall.local"</programlisting>

    <important>
      <para>You have to specify the <emphasis>full</emphasis> path, otherwise
	it will not be loaded with the risk to remain isolated from the
	network.</para>
    </important>

    <para>For our example imagine to have the <devicename>fxp0</devicename>
      interface connected towards the outside (Internet) and the
      <devicename>xl0</devicename> towards the inside
      (<acronym>LAN</acronym>).  The bridge machine has the IP <hostid
      role="ipaddr">1.2.3.4</hostid> (it is not possible that your
      <acronym>ISP</acronym> can give you a class A address like this, but for
      our example it is good).</para>

    <programlisting># Things that we have kept state on before get to go through in a hurry

    <para>Those of you who have set up firewalls before may notice some things
      missing. In particular, there are no anti-spoofing rules, in fact we did
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> add:</para>

    <programlisting>add deny all from 1.2.3.4/8 to any in via fxp0</programlisting>

    <para>That is, drop packets that are coming in from the outside claiming
      to be from our network. This is something that you would commonly do to
      be sure that someone does not try to evade the packet filter, by
      generating nefarious packets that look like they are from the inside.
      The problem with that is that there is <emphasis>at least</emphasis> one
      host on the outside interface that you do not want to ignore: the
      router. But usually, the <acronym>ISP</acronym> anti-spoofs at their
      router, so we do not need to bother that much.</para>

    <para>The last rule seems to be an exact duplicate of the default rule,
      that is, do not let anything pass that is not specifically allowed. But
      there is a difference: all suspected traffic will be logged.</para>

    <para>There are two rules for passing <acronym>SMTP</acronym> and
      <acronym>DNS</acronym> traffic towards the mail server and the name
      server, if you have them. Obviously the whole rule set should be
      flavored to personal taste, this is only a specific example (rule format
      is described accurately in the &man.ipfw.8; man page). Note that in
      order for <quote>relay</quote> and <quote>ns</quote> to work, name service lookups must work
      <emphasis>before</emphasis> the bridge is enabled. This is an example of
      making sure that you set the IP on the correct network card.
      Alternatively it is possible to specify the IP address instead of the
      host name (required if the machine is IP-less).</para>

    <para>People that are used to setting up firewalls are probably also used
      to either having a <option>reset</option> or a <option>forward</option> rule for ident packets
      (<acronym>TCP</acronym> port 113). Unfortunately, this is not an
      applicable option with the bridge, so the best thing is to simply pass
      them to their destination. As long as that destination machine is not
      running an ident daemon, this is relatively harmless. The alternative is
      dropping connections on port 113, which creates some problems with
      services like <acronym>IRC</acronym> (the ident probe must
      timeout).</para>

    <para>The only other thing that is a little weird that you may have
      noticed is that there is a rule to let the bridge machine speak, and
      another for internal hosts. Remember that this is because the two sets
      of traffic will take different paths through the kernel and into the
      packet filter. The inside net will go through the bridge, while the
      local machine will use the normal IP stack to speak. Thus the two rules
      to handle the different cases. The <literal>in via
      <devicename>fxp0</devicename></literal> rules work for both paths. In general, if
      you use <option>in via</option> rules throughout the filter, you will need to make an
      exception for locally generated packets, because they did not come in
      via any of our interfaces.</para>

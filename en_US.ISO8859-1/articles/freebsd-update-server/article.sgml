    <para>This article describes building an internal &fbus.ap;.
      The <ulink

      is written by &a.cperciva;, current Security Officer of &os;.
      For users that think it is convenient to update their systems
      against an official update server, building their own &fbus.ap; may
      help to extend its functionality by supporting manually-tweaked
      &os; releases or by providing a local mirror that will allow faster
      updates for a number of machines.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Experienced users or administrators are often responsible for
      several machines or environments.  They understand the difficult
      demands and challenges of maintaining such an infrastructure.
      Running a &fbus.ap; makes it easier to deploy security and software
      patches to selected test machines before rolling them out to
      production.  It also means a number of systems can be updated from the
      local network rather than a much slower Internet connection.
      This article outlines the steps involved in creating an internal
      &fbus.ap;.</para>

    <title>Prerequisites</title>

    <para>To build an internal &fbus.ap; some requirements should be
      met.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>A running &os; system.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>At a minimum, updates require building on a &os;
	    release greater than or equal to the target release
	    version for distribution.</para>
	</note>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A user account with at least 4&nbsp;GB of available space.
	  This will allow the creation of updates for 7.1 and 7.2, but the
	  exact space requirements may change from version to version.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>An &man.ssh.1; account on a remote machine to upload
	  distributed updates.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A web server, like <ulink
	    url="&url.books.handbook;/network-apache.html">Apache</ulink>,
	  with over half of the space required for the build.  For instance,
	  test builds for 7.1 and 7.2 consume a total amount of 4&nbsp;GB,
	  and the webserver space needed to distribute these updates is
	  2.6&nbsp;GB.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Basic knowledge of shell scripting with Bourne shell,
	  &man.sh.1;.</para>

    <para>Update <filename>scripts/build.conf</filename> appropriately.

      <para>In order for &fbus.ap; to work properly, updates
	for both the <emphasis>current</emphasis> release and the
	release <emphasis>one wants to upgrade to</emphasis> need to be
	built.  This is necessary for determining the differences of
	files between releases.  For example, when upgrading a &os;
	system from version 7.1 to 7.2, updates will need to be built
	for 7.1-RELEASE as well as for 7.2-RELEASE.</para>

    <title>Building a Patch</title>

    <para>Every time a <ulink
	url="&url.base;/security/advisories.html">security advisory</ulink>
      or <ulink url="&url.base;/security/notices.html">security notice</ulink>
      is announced, a patch update can be built.</para>

    <para>For this example, 7.1-RELEASE will be used.</para>

    <para>A couple of assumptions are made for a different release
      build:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Setup the correct directory structure for the initial
	  build.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Perform an initial build for 7.1-RELEASE.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Create the patch directory of the respective release
      under <filename
	class="directory">/usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/</filename>.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mkdir -p /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE/</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE</userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>As an example, take the patch for &man.named.8;.  Read the advisory,
      and grab the necessary file from <ulink
	url="&url.base;/security/advisories.html">&os; Security
	Advisories</ulink>.  More information on interpreting the advisory,
      can be found in the <ulink
	url="&url.books.handbook;/security-advisories.html">&os; Handbook</ulink>.</para>

    <para>In the <ulink
	url="http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09:12.bind.asc">security brief</ulink>,
      this advisory is called <literal>SA-09:12.bind</literal>.  After
      downloading the file, it is required to rename the file to an
      appropriate patch level.  It is suggested to keep this consistent with
      official &os; patch levels, but its name may be freely chosen.
      For this build, let us follow the currently established practice of
      &os; and call this <literal>p7</literal>.  Rename the file:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE/; mv bind.patch 7-SA-09:12.bind </userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>or:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE/; fetch -o 7-SA-09:12.bind http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-09:12/bind.patch</userinput></screen>
    </informalexample>

    <note>
      <para>When running a patch level build, it is assumed that previous
	patches are in place.  When a patch build is run, it will run all
	patches contained in the patch directory.</para>

      <para>There can be custom patches added to any build.  Use the number
	zero, or any other number.</para>
    </note>

    <warning>
      <para>It is up to the administrator of the &fbus.ap; to take
	appropriate measures to verify the authenticity of every
	patch.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>At this point, a <emphasis>diff</emphasis> is ready to be built.
      The software checks first to see if a
      <filename>scripts/init.sh</filename> has been run on the respective
      release prior to running the diff build.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sh scripts/diff.sh <replaceable>amd64 7.1-RELEASE 7</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <!-- These are nice tips, but there are only a few of them and they need a
	 bit of rewording to make sense.  I'd like to see something that
	 explains at least the following for every tip:

	 * Why is this tip necessary?  What is the original problem it tries
	   to solve?
	 * How to install the changes of the tip (preferrably in a <procedure>
	   element, with clearly separated steps.
	 * How to check that the changes of the tip had a measurable and
	   noticeable effect.

	 We can do this in a followup commit.  It doesn't have to be completed
	 *before* we commit this to CVS. -->

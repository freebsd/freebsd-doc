      <para>Beginners may find it difficult to relate the
	facts from the formal documentation on the BSD
	<filename>rc.d</filename> framework with the practical tasks
	of <filename>rc.d</filename> scripting.  In this article,
	we consider a few typical cases of increasing complexity,
	show <filename>rc.d</filename> features suited for each
	case, and discuss how they work.  Such an examination should
	provide reference points for further study of the design
	and efficient application of <filename>rc.d</filename>.</para>

  <sect1 id="rcng-intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The historical BSD had a monolithic startup script,
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename>.  It was invoked by
      &man.init.8; at system boot time and performed all userland
      tasks required for multi-user operation: checking and
      mounting file systems, setting up the network, starting
      daemons, and so on.  The precise list of tasks was not the
      same in every system; admins needed to customize it.  With
      few exceptions, <filename>/etc/rc</filename> had to be modified,
      and true hackers liked it.</para>

    <para>The real problem with the monolithic approach was that
      it provided no control over the individual components started
      from <filename>/etc/rc</filename>.  For instance,
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> could not restart a single daemon.
      The system admin had to find the daemon process by hand, kill it,
      wait until it actually exited, then browse through
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> for the flags, and finally type
      the full command line to start the daemon again.  The task
      would become even more difficult and prone to errors if the
      service to restart consisted of more than one daemon or
      demanded additional actions.  In a few words, the single
      script failed to fulfill what scripts are for: to make the
      system admin's life easier.</para>

    <para>Later there was an attempt to split out some parts of
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> for the sake of starting the
      most important subsystems separately.  The notorious example
      was <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> to bring up networking.
      It did allow for accessing the network from single-user
      mode, but it did not integrate well into the automatic startup
      process because parts of its code needed to interleave with
      actions essentially unrelated to networking.  That was why
      <filename>/etc/netstart</filename> mutated into
      <filename>/etc/rc.network</filename>.  The latter was no
      longer an ordinary script; it comprised of large, tangled
      &man.sh.1; functions called from <filename>/etc/rc</filename>
      at different stages of system startup.  However, as the startup
      tasks grew diverse and sophisticated, the
      <quote>quasi-modular</quote> approach became even more of a
      drag than the monolithic <filename>/etc/rc</filename> had
      been.</para>

    <para>Without a clean and well-designed framework, the startup
      scripts had to bend over backwards to satisfy the needs of
      rapidly developing BSD-based operating systems.  It became
      obvious at last that more steps are necessary on the way to
      a fine-grained and extensible <filename>rc</filename> system.
      Thus BSD <filename>rc.d</filename> was born.  Its acknowledged
      fathers were Luke Mewburn and the NetBSD community.  Later
      it was imported into &os;.  Its name refers to the location
      of system scripts for individual services, which is in
      <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename>.  Soon we
      will learn about more components of the <filename>rc.d</filename>
      system and see how the individual scripts are invoked.</para>

    <para>The basic ideas behind BSD <filename>rc.d</filename> are
      <emphasis>fine modularity</emphasis> and <emphasis>code
      reuse</emphasis>.  <emphasis>Fine modularity</emphasis> means
      that each basic <quote>service</quote> such as a system daemon
      or primitive startup task gets its own &man.sh.1; script able
      to start the service, stop it, reload it, check its status.
      A particular action is chosen by the command-line argument
      to the script.  The <filename>/etc/rc</filename> script still
      drives system startup, but now it merely invokes the smaller
      scripts one by one with the <option>start</option> argument.
      It is easy to perform shutdown tasks as well by running the
      same set of scripts with the <option>stop</option> argument,
      which is done by <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename>.  Note
      how closely this follows the Unix way of having a set of small
      specialized tools, each fulfilling its task as well as possible.
      <emphasis>Code reuse</emphasis> means that common operations
      are implemented as &man.sh.1; functions and collected in
      <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename>.  Now a typical script can
      be just a few lines' worth of &man.sh.1; code.  Finally, an
      important part of the <filename>rc.d</filename> framework is
      &man.rcorder.8;, which helps <filename>/etc/rc</filename> to
      run the small scripts orderly with respect to dependencies
      between them.  It can help <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename>,
      too, because the proper order for the shutdown sequence is
      opposite to that of startup.</para>

    <para>The BSD <filename>rc.d</filename> design is described in
      <link linkend="lukem">the original article by Luke Mewburn</link>,
      and the <filename>rc.d</filename> components are documented
      in great detail in <link linkend="manpages">the respective
      manual pages</link>.  However, it might not appear obvious
      to an <filename>rc.d</filename> newbie how to tie the numerous
      bits and pieces together in order to create a well-styled
      script for a particular task.  Therefore this article will
      try a different approach to describe <filename>rc.d</filename>.
      It will show which features should be used in a number of
      typical cases, and why.  Note that this is not a how-to
      document because our aim is not at giving ready-made recipes,
      but at showing a few easy entrances into the
      <filename>rc.d</filename> realm.  Neither is this article a
      replacement for the relevant manual pages.  Do not hesitate
      to refer to them for more formal and complete documentation
      while reading this article.</para>

    <para>There are prerequisites to understanding this article.
      First of all, you should be familiar with the &man.sh.1;
      scripting language in order to master <filename>rc.d</filename>.
      In addition, you should know how the system performs
      userland startup and shutdown tasks, which is described in
      &man.rc.8;.</para>

    <para>This article focuses on the &os; branch of
      <filename>rc.d</filename>.  Nevertheless, it may be useful
      to NetBSD developers, too, because the two branches of BSD
      <filename>rc.d</filename> not only share the same design
      but also stay similar in their aspects visible to script
      authors.</para>

  <sect1 id="rcng-task">
    <title>Outlining the task</title>

    <para>A little consideration before starting
      <envar>$EDITOR</envar> will not hurt.  In order to write a
      well-tempered <filename>rc.d</filename> script for a system
      service, we should be able to answer the following questions
      first:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Is the service mandatory or optional?</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Will the script serve a single program, e.g.,
	  a daemon, or perform more complex actions?</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Which other services will our service depend on,
	  and vice versa?</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>From the examples that follow we will see why it is
      important to know the answers to these questions.</para>

  <sect1 id="rcng-dummy">
    <title>A dummy script</title>

    <para>The following script just emits a message each time the

	<para>An interpreted script should begin with the magic

	    install that element in <filename>/usr/sbin</filename>
	    (for the system) or <filename>/usr/local/sbin</filename>
	    (for ports) and call it from a &man.sh.1; script in the
	    appropriate <filename>rc.d</filename> directory.</para>

	<tip>
	  <para>If you would like to learn the details of why
	    <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts must be written in
	    the &man.sh.1; language, see how <filename>/etc/rc</filename>
	    invokes them by means of <function>run_rc_script</function>,
	    then study the implementation of
	    <function>run_rc_script</function> in
	    <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename>.</para>
	</tip>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="rcng-dummy-include">
	<para>In <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename>, a number of
	  &man.sh.1; functions are defined for an <filename>rc.d</filename>
	  script to use.  The functions are documented in
	  &man.rc.subr.8;.  While it is theoretically possible to
	  write an <filename>rc.d</filename> script without ever
	  using &man.rc.subr.8;, its functions prove extremely handy
	  and make the job an order of magnitude easier.  So it is
	  no surprise that everybody resorts to &man.rc.subr.8; in
	  <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts.  We are not going to
	  be an exception.</para>

	<para>An <filename>rc.d</filename> script must

	  (include it using <quote><command>.</command></quote>)
	  <emphasis>before</emphasis> it calls &man.rc.subr.8;
	  functions so that &man.sh.1; has an opportunity to learn
	  the functions.  The preferred style is to source
	  <filename>/etc/rc.subr</filename> first of all.</para>

	  <para>Some useful functions related to networking

	<note>
	  <para>The current style of <filename>rc.d</filename>
	    scripting is to enclose values assigned to variables

	    safely omit quotes from around simple words without
	    &man.sh.1; metacharacters in them, while in certain

      <callout arearefs="rcng-dummy-startcmd">

	  such arguments: <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option>,
	  <option>restart</option>, <option>poll</option>, and
	  <option>status</option>.</para>

	<para>The daemon will be started by running
	  <envar>$command</envar> with command-line flags specified
	  by <envar>$mumbled_flags</envar>.  Thus all the input
	  data for the default <option>start</option> method are
	  available in the variables set by our script.  Unlike
	  <option>start</option>, other methods may require additional
	  information about the process started.  For instance,
	  <option>stop</option> must know the PID of the process
	  to terminate it.  In the present case, &man.rc.subr.8;
	  will scan through the list of all processes, looking for
	  a process with its name equal to <envar>$procname</envar>.
	  The latter is another variable of meaning to &man.rc.subr.8;,
	  and its value defaults to that of <envar>command</envar>.
	  In other words, when we set <envar>command</envar>,
	  <envar>procname</envar> is effectively set to the same
	  value.  This enables our script to kill the daemon and
	  to check if it is running in the first place.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Some programs are in fact executable scripts.  The
	    system runs such a script by starting its interpreter
	    and passing the name of the script to it as a command-line
	    argument.  This is reflected in the list of processes,
	    which can confuse &man.rc.subr.8;.  You should additionally
	    set <envar>command_interpreter</envar> to let &man.rc.subr.8;
	    know the actual name of the process if <envar>$command</envar>
	    is a script.</para>

	  <para>For each <filename>rc.d</filename> script, there
	    is an optional &man.rc.conf.5; variable that takes
	    precedence over <envar>command</envar>.  Its name is
	    constructed as follows: <envar>${name}_program</envar>,
	    where <envar>name</envar> is the mandatory variable we
	    discussed <link linkend="name-var">earlier</link>.
	    E.g., in this case it will be <envar>mumbled_program</envar>.
	    It is &man.rc.subr.8; that arranges
	    <envar>${name}_program</envar> to override
	    <envar>command</envar>.</para>

	  <para>Of course, &man.sh.1; will permit you to set
	    <envar>${name}_program</envar> from &man.rc.conf.5; or
	    the script itself even if <envar>command</envar> is
	    unset.  In that case, the special properties of
	    <envar>${name}_program</envar> are lost, and it becomes
	    an ordinary variable your script can use for its own
	    purposes.  However, the sole use of
	    <envar>${name}_program</envar> is discouraged because
	    using it together with <envar>command</envar> became
	    an idiom of <filename>rc.d</filename> scripting.</para>

  <sect1 id="rcng-hookup">
    <title>Connecting a script to the rc.d framework</title>

    <para>After a script has been written, it needs to be integrated
      into <filename>rc.d</filename>.  The crucial step is to install
      the script in <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> (for the base
      system) or <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> (for
      ports).  Both &lt;<filename>bsd.prog.mk</filename>&gt; and
      &lt;<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>&gt; provide convenient
      hooks for that, and usually you do not have to worry about
      the proper ownership and mode.  System scripts should be
      installed from <filename>src/etc/rc.d</filename> through the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> found there.  Port scripts can
      be installed using <makevar>USE_RC_SUBR</makevar> as described
      <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;/rc-scripts.html">in
      the Porter's Handbook</ulink>.</para>

    <para>However, we should consider beforehand the place of
      our script in the system startup sequence.  The service handled
      by our script is likely to depend on other services.  For
      instance, a network daemon cannot function without the network
      interfaces and routing up and running.  Even if a service
      seems to demand nothing, it can hardly start before the basic
      filesystems have been checked and mounted.</para>

    <para>We mentioned &man.rcorder.8; already.  Now it is time to
      have a close look at it.  In a nutshell, &man.rcorder.8; takes
      a set of files, examines their contents, and prints a
      dependency-ordered list of files from the set to
      <varname>stdout</varname>.  The point is to keep dependency
      information <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the files so that
      each file can speak for itself only.  A file can specify the
      following information:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>the names of the <quote>conditions</quote> (which means
	  services to us) it <emphasis>provides</emphasis>;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the names of the <quote>conditions</quote>
	  it <emphasis>requires</emphasis>;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the names of the <quote>conditions</quote> this file
	  should run <emphasis>before</emphasis>;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>additional <emphasis>keywords</emphasis> that can be
	  used to select a subset from the whole set of files
	  (&man.rcorder.8; can be instructed via options to include
	  or omit the files having particular keywords listed.)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is no surprise that &man.rcorder.8; can handle only
      text files with a syntax close to that of &man.sh.1;.  That
      is, special lines understood by &man.rcorder.8; look like
      &man.sh.1; comments.  The syntax of such special lines is
      rather rigid to simplify their processing.  See &man.rcorder.8;
      for details.</para>

    <para>Besides using &man.rcorder.8; special lines, a script can
      insist on its dependency upon another service by just starting
      it forcibly.  This can be needed when the other service is
      optional and will not start by itself because the system admin
      has disabled it mistakenly in &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>With this general knowledge in mind, let us consider the
      simple daemon script enhanced with dependency stuff:</para>

    <para>As before, detailed analysis follows:</para>

    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="rcng-hookup-provide">
	<para>That line declares the names of <quote>conditions</quote>
	  our script provides.  Now other scripts can record a
	  dependency on our script by those names.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>Usually a script specifies a single condition
	    provided.  However, nothing prevents us from listing
	    several conditions there, e.g., for compatibility
	    reasons.</para>

	  <para>In any case, the name of the main, or the only,
	    <literal>PROVIDE:</literal> condition should be the
	    same as <envar>${name}</envar>.</para>
	</note>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="rcng-hookup-require rcng-hookup-before">
	<para>So our script indicates which <quote>conditions</quote>
	  provided by other scripts it depends on.  According to
	  the lines, our script asks &man.rcorder.8; to put it after
	  the script(s) providing <filename>DAEMON</filename> and
	  <filename>cleanvar</filename>, but before that providing
	  <filename>LOGIN</filename>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <literal>BEFORE:</literal> line should not be
	    abused to work around an incomplete dependency list in
	    the other script.  The appropriate case for using
	    <literal>BEFORE:</literal> is when the other script
	    does not care about ours, but our script can do its
	    task better if run before the other one.  A typical
	    real-life example is the network interfaces vs. the
	    firewall: While the interfaces do not depend on the
	    firewall in doing their job, the system security will
	    benefit from the firewall being ready before there is
	    any network traffic.</para>

	  <para>Besides conditions corresponding to a single service
	    each, there are meta-conditions and their
	    <quote>placeholder</quote> scripts used to ensure that
	    certain groups of operations are performed before others.
	    These are denoted by
	    <filename><replaceable>UPPERCASE</replaceable></filename>
	    names.  Their list and purposes can be found in
	    &man.rc.8;.</para>

	  <para>Keep in mind that putting a service name in the
	    <literal>REQUIRE:</literal> line does not guarantee
	    that the service will actually be running by the time
	    our script starts.  The required service may fail to
	    start or just be disabled in &man.rc.conf.5;.  Obviously,
	    &man.rcorder.8; cannot track such details, and &man.rc.8;
	    will not do that either.  Consequently, the application
	    started by our script should be able to cope with any
	    required services being unavailable.  In certain cases,
	    we can help it as discussed <link

	  &man.rcorder.8; keywords can be used to select or leave
	  out some scripts.  Namely any &man.rcorder.8; consumer
	  can specify through <option>-k</option> and <option>-s</option>
	  options which keywords are on the <quote>keep list</quote> and
	  <quote>skip list</quote>, respectively.  From all the
	  files to be dependency sorted, &man.rcorder.8; will pick
	  only those having a keyword from the keep list (unless empty)
	  and not having a keyword from the skip list.</para>

	<para>In &os;, &man.rcorder.8; is used by
	  <filename>/etc/rc</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename>.  These two scripts
	  define the standard list of &os; <filename>rc.d</filename>
	  keywords and their meanings as follows:</para>

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><literal>nojail</literal></term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>The service is not for &man.jail.8; environment.

		ignore the script if inside a jail.</para>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><literal>nostart</literal></term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>The service is to be started manually or not
		started at all.  The automatic startup procedure
		will ignore the script.  In conjunction with the
		<literal>shutdown</literal> keyword, this can be
		used to write scripts that do something only at
		system shutdown.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><literal>shutdown</literal></term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>This keyword is to be listed
		<emphasis>explicitly</emphasis> if the service needs
		to be stopped before system shutdown.</para>

	      <note>
		<para>When the system is going to shut down,
		  <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename> runs.  It
		  assumes that most <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts
		  have nothing to do at that time.  Therefore
		  <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename>
		  selectively invokes <filename>rc.d</filename>
		  scripts with the <literal>shutdown</literal>
		  keyword, effectively ignoring the
		  rest of the scripts.  For even faster shutdown,
		  <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename> passes
		  the <option>faststop</option> command to the scripts
		  it runs so that they skip preliminary checks, e.g.,
		  the pidfile check.  As dependent services should be
		  stopped before their prerequisites,
		  <filename>/etc/rc.shutdown</filename> runs the scripts
		  in reverse dependency order.</para>

		<para>If writing a real
		  <filename>rc.d</filename> script, you should
		  consider whether it is relevant at system shutdown
		  time.  E.g., if your script does its work in
		  response to the <option>start</option> command
		  only, then you need not include this keyword.
		  However, if your script manages a service, it is
		  probably a good idea to stop it before the system
		  proceeds to the final stage of its shutdown
		  sequence described in &man.halt.8;.  In particular,
		  a service should be stopped explicitly if it needs
		  considerable time or special actions to shut down
		  cleanly.  A typical example of such a service is
		  a database engine.</para>

    <title>Giving more flexibility to an rc.d script</title>

    <para>When invoked during startup or shutdown, an
      <filename>rc.d</filename> script is supposed to act on the
      entire subsystem it is responsible for.  E.g.,
      <filename>/etc/rc.d/netif</filename> should start or stop all
      network interfaces described by &man.rc.conf.5;.  Either task
      can be uniquely indicated by a single command argument such
      as <option>start</option> or <option>stop</option>.  Between
      startup and shutdown, <filename>rc.d</filename> scripts help
      the admin to control the running system, and it is when the
      need for more flexibility and precision arises.  For instance,
      the admin may want to add the settings of a new network
      interface to &man.rc.conf.5; and then to start it without
      interfering with the operation of the existing interfaces.
      Next time the admin may need to shut down a single network
      interface.  In the spirit of the command line, the respective
      <filename>rc.d</filename> script calls for an extra argument,
      the interface name.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, &man.rc.subr.8; allows for passing any number
      of arguments to script's methods (within the system limits).
      Due to that, the changes in the script itself can be minimal.</para>
    
    <para>How can &man.rc.subr.8; gain
      access to the extra command-line arguments.  Should it just
      grab them directly?  Not by any means.  Firstly, an &man.sh.1;
      function has no access to the positional parameters of
      its caller, but &man.rc.subr.8; is just a sack of such
      functions.  Secondly, the good manner of
      <filename>rc.d</filename> dictates that it is for the
      main script to decide which arguments are to be passed
      to its methods.</para>

    <para>So the approach adopted by &man.rc.subr.8; is as follows:
      <function>run_rc_command</function> passes on all its
      arguments but the first one to the respective method verbatim.
      The first, omitted, argument is the name of the method itself:
      <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option>, etc.  It will
      be shifted out by <function>run_rc_command</function>,
      so what is <envar>$2</envar> in the original command line will
      be presented as <envar>$1</envar> to the method, and so on.</para>

    <para>To illustrate this opportunity, let us modify the primitive
      dummy script so that its messages depend on the additional
      arguments supplied.  Here we go:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

. /etc/rc.subr

name="dummy"
start_cmd="${name}_start"
stop_cmd=":"
kiss_cmd="${name}_kiss"
extra_commands="kiss"

dummy_start()
{
        if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then<co id="rcng-args-start">
                echo "Greeting message: $*"
        else
                echo "Nothing started."
        fi
}

dummy_kiss()
{
        echo -n "A ghost gives you a kiss"
        if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then<co id="rcng-args-kiss">
                echo -n " and whispers: $*"
        fi
        case "$*" in
        *[.!?])
                echo
                ;;
        *)
                echo .
                ;;
        esac
}

load_rc_config $name
run_rc_command "$@"<co id="rcng-args-all"></programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>What essential changes can we notice in the script?</para>

    <calloutlist>
      <callout arearefs="rcng-args-start">
	<para>All arguments you type after <option>start</option>
	  can end up as positional parameters to the respective
	  method.  We can use them in any way according to our
	  task, skills, and fancy.  In the current example, we just
	  pass all of them to &man.echo.1; as one string in the
	  next line &mdash; note <envar>$*</envar> within the double
	  quotes.  Here is how the script can be invoked now:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/dummy start</userinput>
Nothing started.
&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/dummy start Hello world!</userinput>
Greeting message: Hello world!</screen>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="rcng-args-kiss">
	<para>The same applies to any method our script provides,
	  not only to a standard one.  We have added a custom method
	  named <option>kiss</option>, and it can take advantage of
	  the extra arguments not less than <option>start</option>
	  does.  E.g.:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/dummy kiss</userinput>
A ghost gives you a kiss.
&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/dummy kiss Once I was Etaoin Shrdlu...</userinput>
A ghost gives you a kiss and whispers: Once I was Etaoin Shrdlu...</screen>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="rcng-args-all">
	<para>If we want just to pass all extra arguments to
	  any method, we can merely substitute <literal>"$@"</literal>
	  for <literal>"$1"</literal> in the last line of our script,
	  where we invoke <function>run_rc_command</function>.</para>

	<important>
	  <para>An &man.sh.1; programmer ought to understand the
	    subtle difference between <envar>$*</envar> and
	    <envar>$@</envar> as the ways to designate all positional
	    parameters.  For its in-depth discussion, refer to a
	    good handbook on &man.sh.1; scripting.  <emphasis>Do
	    not</emphasis> use the expressions until you fully
	    understand them because their misuse will result in
	    buggy and insecure scripts.</para>
	</important>

	<note>
	  <para>Currently <function>run_rc_command</function> may
	    have a bug that prevents it from keeping the original
	    boundaries between arguments.  That is, arguments with
	    embedded whitespace may not be processed correctly.
	    The bug stems from <envar>$*</envar> misuse.</para>

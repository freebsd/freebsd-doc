      <para>The FreeBSD project is a worldwide, volunteer based, and
        collaborative project, which develops a portable and high-quality
        operating system.  The FreeBSD project distributes the source
        code for its product under a liberal license, with the
        intention of encouraging the use of its code.  Collaborating
        with the FreeBSD project can help organizations reduce their
        time to market, reduce engineering costs and improve their
        product quality.</para>

      <para>This article examines the issues in using FreeBSD code in
        appliances and software products.  It highlights the
        characteristics of FreeBSD that make it an excellent substrate
        for product development. The article concludes by suggesting a
        few <quote>best practices</quote> for organizations
        collaborating with the FreeBSD project.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>FreeBSD today is well-known as a high-performance server
      operating system.  It is deployed on millions of web servers and
      internet-facing hosts worldwide.  FreeBSD code also forms an
      integral part of many products, ranging from appliances such as
      network routers, firewalls, and storage devices, to personal
      computers.  Portions of FreeBSD have also been used in
      commercial shrink-wrapped software (see
      <xref linkend="freebsd-intro"/>).</para>

    <para>In this article we look at the <link xlink:href="&url.base;/">FreeBSD project</link> as a software
      engineering resource&mdash;as a collection of building blocks
      and processes which you can use to build products.</para>

    <para>While FreeBSD's source is distributed freely to the public,
      to fully enjoy the benefits of the project's work, organizations
      need to <emphasis>collaborate</emphasis> with the project.  In
      subsequent sections of this article we discuss effective means
      of collaboration with the project and the pitfalls that need to
      be avoided while doing so.</para>

    <formalpara>
      <title>Caveat Reader</title>
      <para>The author believes that the characteristics of the FreeBSD
      	Project listed in this article were substantially true at the
	time the article was conceived and written (2005).  However, the
	reader should keep in mind that the practices and processes used
	by open-source communities can change over time, and that the information
	in this article should therefore be taken as indicative rather
	than normative.</para>

          California, Berkeley <citation>McKu1999-1</citation>,
          fosters high-quality work. Some features in FreeBSD define

      costs and lower development risks. </simpara>

    <sect2>
      <title>Building with FreeBSD</title>

      <simpara>Here are a few ways organizations have used
        FreeBSD:</simpara>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>As an upstream source for tested code for libraries
            and utilities.</simpara>
          <simpara>By being <quote>downstream</quote> of the project,
            organizations leverage the new features, bug fixes and
            testing that the upstream code receives.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>As an embedded OS (for example, for an OEM router
            and firewall device).  In this model, organizations use a
            customized FreeBSD kernel and application program set
            along with a proprietary management layer for their
            device. OEMs benefit from new hardware support being added
            by the FreeBSD project upstream, and from the testing that
            the base system receives.</simpara>
          <simpara>FreeBSD ships with a self-hosting development
            environment that allows easy creation of such
            configurations.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>As a Unix compatible environment for the management
            functions of high-end storage and networking devices,
            running on a separate processor <quote>blade</quote>.</simpara>
          <simpara>FreeBSD provides the tools for creating dedicated
            OS and application program images.  Its implementation of
            a BSD unix API is mature and tested.  FreeBSD can also
            provide a stable cross-development environment for the
            other components of the high-end device.</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>As a vehicle to get widespread testing and support
            from a worldwide team of developers for non-critical
            <quote>intellectual property</quote>.</simpara>
          <simpara>In this model, organizations contribute useful
            infrastructural frameworks to the FreeBSD project (for
            example, see &man.netgraph.3;).  The widespread
            exposure that the code gets helps to quickly identify
            performance issues and bugs.  The involvement of
            top-notch developers also leads to useful extensions to
            the infrastructure that the contributing organization also
            benefits from.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>As a development environment supporting
            cross-development for embedded OSes like <link xlink:href="http://www.rtems.com/">RTEMS</link> and <link xlink:href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/">eCOS</link>.</simpara>
          <simpara>There are many full-fledged development environments
            in the &os.numports;-strong collection of applications ported and
            packaged with FreeBSD.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>As a way to support a Unix-like API in an otherwise
            proprietary OS, increasing its palatability for
            application developers.</simpara>
          <simpara>Here parts of FreeBSD's kernel and application
            programs are <quote>ported</quote> to run alongside
            other tasks in the proprietary OS.  The availability of a
            stable and well tested <trademark>Unix</trademark> API
            implementation can reduce the effort needed to port
            popular applications to the proprietary OS.  As FreeBSD
            ships with high-quality documentation for its internals
            and has effective vulnerability management and release
            engineering processes, the costs of keeping upto-date are
            kept low.</simpara>

      <para>There are many thousands of contributors in the first
        group; the vast majority of contributions to FreeBSD come from
        individuals in this group.  Commit rights (write access) to
        the repository are granted to individuals who contribute
        consistently to the project.  Commit rights come with
        additional responsibilities, and new committers are assigned
        mentors to help them learn the ropes.</para>

      <para>To be able to work effectively with the FreeBSD project,
        you need to understand the project's culture.</para>

      <para>Volunteer driven projects operate under different rules
        than for-profit corporates.  A common mistake that companies
        make when venturing into the open-source world is that of
        underplaying these differences.</para>

        <title>Motivation</title>

        <para>Most contributions to FreeBSD are done voluntarily
          without monetary rewards entering the picture.  The factors
          that motivate individuals are complex, ranging from
          altruism, to an interest in solving the kinds of problems
          that FreeBSD attempts to solve.  In this environment,
          <quote>elegance is never optional</quote>

        <title>The Long Term View</title>
        <para>FreeBSD traces its roots back nearly twenty years to the
          work of the Computer Science Research Group at the
          University of California Berkeley.<footnote>
            <simpara>FreeBSD's <link xlink:href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/">source
                repository</link> contains a history of the project
              since its inception, and there are <link xlink:href="http://www.mckusick.com/csrg/">CDROMs
                available</link> that contain earlier code from the
              CSRG.</simpara>
          </footnote>  A number of the original CSRG developers remain
          associated with the project.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <para>The project values long-term perspectives
        <citation>Nor2001</citation>.  A frequent acronym encountered
        in the project is <acronym>DTRT</acronym>, which stands for

      <formalpara>
        <title>Development Processes</title>
        <para>Computer programs are tools for communication: at one
          level programmers communicate their intentions using a
          precise notation to a tool (a compiler) that translates
          their instructions to executable code.  At another level,
          the same notation is used for communication of intent
          between two programmers.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <para>Formal specifications and design documents are seldom used
        in the project.  Clear and well-written code and well-written
        change logs (<xref linkend="fig-change-log"/>) are used in
        their place.  FreeBSD development happens by <quote>rough

Use double precision to simplify and optimize arg reduction for small
and medium size args too: instead of conditionally subtracting a float
17+24, 17+17+24 or 17+17+17+24 bit approximation to pi/2, always
subtract a double 33+53 bit one.  The float version is now closer to
the double version than to old versions of itself -- it uses the same
33+53 bit approximation as the simplest cases in the double version,
and where the float version had to switch to the slow general case at
|x| == 2^7*pi/2, it now switches at |x| == 2^19*pi/2 the same as the
double version.

This speeds up arg reduction by a factor of 2 for |x| between 3*pi/4 and
2^7*pi/4, and by a factor of 7 for |x| between 2^7*pi/4 and 2^19*pi/4.

    <para>We examined the characteristics of the FreeBSD project that
      make it an excellent choice for being part of an organization's
      product strategy.  We then looked at the prevailing culture of
      the project and examined effective ways of interacting with its

      <para>This article documents how to set up a firewall using a PPP
	dialup with FreeBSD and IPFW, and specifically with firewalling over
	a dialup with a dynamically assigned IP address.  This document does
	not include information on setting up an initial PPP connection.
	For more information on setting up a PPP connection, consult
	the &man.ppp.8; manual page.</para>

    <para>In order to use IPFW, support for it must be compiled into the

    <title>Changing <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to load the

    <para><filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> needs to be slightly

      specify the location for our rules file.  Add the following lines

    <programlisting>firewall_enable="YES"

    <title>Enable PPP's network address translation</title>

    <para>In order to allow clients on your network to connect via
      your gateway, you will need to enable PPP's network address
      translation (NAT).  In order to use PPP's NAT functions, add the
      following lines to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>ppp_enable="YES"
ppp_mode="auto"
ppp_nat="YES"
ppp_profile="<replaceable>your_profile</replaceable>"</programlisting>

    <note><para>Take care to change <literal>your_profile</literal> to
      the name of your own dialup profile.</para></note>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="rules">
    <title>The rule set for the firewall</title>

    <para>This is the point where we define the firewall rules for your
      system.  The ruleset that we're about to describe is a generic
      template for most dialup users.  While it will not suit the exact
      needs of every user, it provides you with a basic idea of how IPFW
      works and should be fairly easy to customize.</para>

    <para>First, let's start with the basics of closed firewalling.
      Closed firewalling is based on the idea that everything is denied
      by default.  The system administrator may then explicitly add
      rules for traffic that he or she would like to allow.  Rules
      should be in the order of allow first, and then deny.  The premise
      is that you add the rules for everything you would like to allow,
      and then everything else is automatically denied.</para>

    <para>Following that, let's create the directory where we will store our
      firewall rules.  In this example, we'll use <filename
      class="directory">/etc/firewall</filename>. Change into the
      directory and edit the file <filename>fwrules</filename> as we
      specified in <filename>rc.conf</filename>.  Please note that you
      can change this filename to anything you wish.  This guide merely
      gives an example of a filename you may want to use.</para>

    <para>Now, let's look at a nicely commented sample firewall
      file.</para>

    <programlisting># Define the firewall command (as in /etc/rc.firewall) for easy
# reference.  Helps to make it easier to read.
fwcmd="/sbin/ipfw"

# Define our outside interface.  With userland-ppp this
# defaults to tun0.
oif="tun0"

# Define our inside interface.  This is usually your network
# card.  Be sure to change this to match your own network 
# interface.
iif="fxp0"

# Force a flushing of the current rules before we reload.
$fwcmd -f flush

# Check the state of all packets.
$fwcmd add check-state

# Stop spoofing on the outside interface.
$fwcmd add deny ip from any to any in via $oif not verrevpath

# Allow all connections that we initiate, and keep their state.
# but deny established connections that don't have a dynamic rule.
$fwcmd add allow ip from me to any out via $oif keep-state
$fwcmd add deny tcp from any to any established in via $oif

# Allow all connections within our network.
$fwcmd add allow ip from any to any via $iif

# Allow all local traffic.
$fwcmd add allow all from any to any via lo0
$fwcmd add deny all from any to 127.0.0.0/8
$fwcmd add deny ip from 127.0.0.0/8 to any

# Allow internet users to connect to the port 22 and 80.
# This example specifically allows connections to the sshd and a
# webserver.
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to me dst-port 22,80 in via $oif setup keep-state

# Allow ICMP packets: remove type 8 if you don't want your host
# to be pingable.
$fwcmd add allow icmp from any to any via $oif icmptypes 0,3,8,11,12

# Deny and log all the rest.
$fwcmd add deny log ip from any to any</programlisting>

    <para>You now have a fully functional firewall that only allows
      connections to ports 22 and 80 and will log any other connection
      attempts. You may now safely safely reboot and the firewall should
      be automatically started and the ruleset loaded.  If you find this
      incorrect in anyway or experience any problems, or have any
      suggestions to improve this page, please email me.</para>

    <title>Questions</title>

    <qandaset>
      <qandaentry>
        <question>
	  <para>I get messages like <errorname>limit 500 reached on entry
	    2800</errorname> and after that I my machine stops logging
	    denied packets that match that rule number.  Is my firewall
	    still working?</para>
        </question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This merely means that the maximum logging count for
            the rule has been reached.  The rule itself is still
            working, but it will no longer log until such time as you
	    reset the logging counters.  An example of how to clear your
	    counters can be found below:</para>
<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ipfw resetlog</userinput></screen>
	  <para>Alternatively, you may increase the log limit in
            your kernel configuration with the
            <option>IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT</option> option as
            described above.  You may also change this limit (without
	    recompiling your kernel and having to reboot) by using the
	    net.inet.ip.fw.verbose_limit &man.sysctl.8; value.</para>
        </answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>There must be something wrong.  I followed your instructions
	    to the letter and now I am locked out.</para>
        </question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This tutorial assumes that you are running
	    <emphasis>userland-ppp</emphasis>, therefore the supplied rule set
	    operates on the <devicename>tun0</devicename> interface, which
	    corresponds to the first connection made with &man.ppp.8; (a.k.a.
	    <emphasis>user-ppp</emphasis>).  Additional connections would use
	    <devicename>tun1</devicename>, <devicename>tun2</devicename> and so
	    on.</para>

	  <para>You should also note that &man.pppd.8; uses the
	    <devicename>ppp0</devicename> interface instead, so if you
	    start the connection with &man.pppd.8; you must substitute
	    <devicename>tun0</devicename> for
	    <devicename>ppp0</devicename>.  A quick way to edit the
	    firewall rules to reflect this change is shown below. The
	    original rule set is backed up as
	    <filename>fwrules_tun0</filename>.</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>cd /etc/firewall</userinput>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.user; <userinput>su</userinput>
	    <prompt>Password:</prompt>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.root; <userinput>mv fwrules fwrules_tun0</userinput>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.root; <userinput>cat fwrules_tun0 | sed s/tun0/ppp0/g > fwrules</userinput>
	  </screen>

	  <para>To know whether you are currently using &man.ppp.8; or
	    &man.pppd.8; you can examine the output of
	    &man.ifconfig.8; once the connection is up. E.g., for a
	    connection made with &man.pppd.8; you would see something
	    like this (showing only the relevant lines):</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>ifconfig</userinput>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    ppp0: flags=<replaceable>8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1524</replaceable>
                    inet <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> --&gt; <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>0xff000000</replaceable>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    </screen>

	  <para>On the other hand, for a connection made with
	    &man.ppp.8; (<emphasis>user-ppp</emphasis>) you should see
	    something similar to this:</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>ifconfig</userinput>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    ppp0: flags=<replaceable>8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500</replaceable>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    tun0: flags=<replaceable>8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1524</replaceable>
	            <emphasis>(IPv6 stuff skipped...)</emphasis>
                    inet <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> --&gt; <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>0xffffff00</replaceable>
                    Opened by PID <replaceable>xxxxx</replaceable>
            <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis></screen>

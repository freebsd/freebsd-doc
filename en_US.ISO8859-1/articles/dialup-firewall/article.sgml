      <para>This article documents how to setup a firewall using a PPP
	dialup with FreeBSD and IPFW, and specifically with firewalling over
	a dialup with a dynamically assigned IP address.  This document does
	not cover setting up your PPP connection in the first place.</para>

    <para>Dialup Firewalling with FreeBSD</para>

     <para>This document covers the process that is required to setup
       firewalling with FreeBSD when an IP address is assigned dynamically
       by your ISP.  While every effort has been made to make this document
       as informative and correct as possible, you are welcome to mail your
       comments/suggestions to the <email>marcs@draenor.org</email>.</para>

  <sect1 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Options</title>

    <para>The first thing you will need to do is recompile your kernel.
      If you need more information on how to recompile the kernel,
      then the best place to start is the <ulink
	URL="../../books/handbook/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	configuration section in the Handbook</ulink>. You need to add the
      following options into your kernel configuration file:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPFIREWALL</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Enables the kernel's firewall code.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPFW2</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Enables the new version of IPFW.</para>
	  <important><para>Only do this if you're running FreeBSD 4.X,
	  this is the default in newer versions of
	  FreeBSD.</para></important>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Sends logged packets to the system logger.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options
	    IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=<replaceable>100</replaceable></literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Limits the number of times a matching entry is logged.  This
            prevents your log file from filling up with lots of repetitive
	    entries.
	    <replaceable>100</replaceable> is a reasonable number to use, but
	    you can adjust it based on your requirements.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPDIVERT</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Enables <emphasis>divert</emphasis> sockets, which will be
	    shown later.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>There are some other <emphasis>optional</emphasis> items that you
      can compile into the kernel for some added security.  These are not
      required in order to get firewalling to work, but some more paranoid
      users may want to use them.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options TCP_DROP_SYNFIN</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This option ignores TCP packets with SYN and FIN.  This
	   prevents tools like <filename role="package">security/nmap</filename> from identifying the TCP/IP
 	   stack of the machine, but breaks support for RFC1644
           extensions.  This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> recommended if the
           machine will be running a web server.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>

    <para>Do not reboot once you have recompiled the kernel. Hopefully,
      we will only need to reboot once to complete the installation of the
      firewall.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="rcconf">
    <title>Changing <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to load the
      firewall</title>

    <para>We now need to make some changes to
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> in order to tell it about the
      firewall.  Simply add the following lines:</para>

    <programlisting>firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_script="/etc/firewall/fwrules"
natd_enable="YES"
natd_interface="tun0"
natd_flags="-dynamic"</programlisting>

    <para>For more information on the functions of these statements take
     a look at <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> and read
      &man.rc.conf.5;</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Disable PPP's network address translation</title>

    <para>You may already be using PPP's built in network address
      translation (NAT).  If that is the case then you will have to disable
      it, as these examples use &man.natd.8; to do the same.</para>

    <para>If you already have a block of entries to
      automatically start PPP, it probably looks like this:</para>

    <programlisting>ppp_enable="YES"
ppp_mode="auto"
ppp_nat="YES"
ppp_profile="<replaceable>profile</replaceable>"</programlisting>

    <para>If so, you will need to specifically disable
      <literal>ppp_nat</literal> by making sure you have
      <literal>ppp_nat="NO"</literal> in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>. You will
      also need to remove any <literal>nat enable yes</literal> or
      <literal>alias enable yes</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="rules">
    <title>The rule set for the firewall</title>

    <para>We are nearly done now.  All that remains now is to define
      the firewall rules and then we can reboot and the firewall
      should be up and running.  I realize that everyone will want
      something slightly different when it comes to their rule base.
      What I have tried to do is write a rule base that suits most dialup
      users.  You can obviously modify it to your needs by using the
      following rules as the foundation for your own rule base.  First,
      let's start with the basics of closed firewalling.  What you
      want to do is deny everything by default and then only open up
      for the things you really need.  Rules should be in the order of
      allow first and then deny.  The premise is that you add the
      rules for your allows, and then everything else is
      denied. :)</para>

    <para>Now, let's make the dir <filename
      class="directory">/etc/firewall</filename>. Change into the
      directory and edit the file <filename>fwrules</filename> as we
      specified in <filename>rc.conf</filename>.  Please note that you
      can change this filename to anything you wish.  This guide just
      gives an example of a filename. </para>

    <para>Now, let's look at a sample firewall file, that is commented
      nicely.</para>

    <programlisting># Define the firewall command (as in /etc/rc.firewall) for easy
# reference.  Helps to make it easier to read.
fwcmd="/sbin/ipfw"

# Force a flushing of the current rules before we reload.
$fwcmd -f flush

# Divert all packets through the tunnel interface.
$fwcmd add divert natd all from any to any via tun0

# Allow all connections that have dynamic rules built for them,
# but deny established connections that don't have a dynamic rule.
# See ipfw(8) for details.
$fwcmd add check-state
$fwcmd add deny tcp from any to any established

# Allow all localhost connections
$fwcmd add allow tcp from me to any out via lo0 setup keep-state
$fwcmd add deny  tcp from me to any out via lo0
$fwcmd add allow ip  from me to any out via lo0 keep-state

# Allow all connections from my network card that I initiate
$fwcmd add allow tcp from me to any out xmit any setup keep-state
$fwcmd add deny  tcp from me to any
$fwcmd add allow ip from me to any out xmit any keep-state

# Everyone on the Internet is allowed to connect to the following
# services on the machine.  This example specifically allows connections
# to sshd and a webserver.
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to me dst-port 22,80 in recv any setup keep-state

# This sends a RESET to all ident packets.
$fwcmd add reset log tcp from any to me 113 in recv any

# Enable ICMP: remove type 8 if you don't want your host to be pingable
$fwcmd add allow icmp from any to any icmptypes 0,3,8,11,12,13,14

# Deny all the rest.
$fwcmd add deny log ip from any to any</programlisting>

    <para>You now have a fully functional firewall that will allow on
      connections to ports 22 and 80 and will log any other connection
      attempts. Now, you should be able to safely reboot and your firewall
      should come up fine. If you find this incorrect in anyway or experience
      any problems, or have any suggestions to improve this page, please
      email me.</para>

    <title>Questions</title>

    <qandaset>
      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>Why are you using &man.natd.8; and &man.ipfw.8; when
	    you could be using the built in &man.ppp.8;
	    filters?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>I will have to be honest and say there is no definitive
	    reason why I use <command>ipfw</command> and
	    <command>natd</command> instead of the built in
	    <command>ppp</command> filters.  From the discussions I have
	    had with people the consensus seems to be that while
	    <command>ipfw</command> is certainly more powerful and
	    more configurable than the <command>ppp</command> filters,
	    what it makes up for in functionality it loses in being
	    easy to customize.  One of the reasons I use it is because
	    I prefer firewalling to be done at a kernel level rather
	    than by a userland program.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
	  <para>I get messages like <errorname>limit 100 reached on entry
	    2800</errorname> and after that I never see more denies in my
	    logs.  Is my firewall still working?</para>
        </question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This merely means that the maximum logging count for
            the rule has been reached.  The rule itself is still
            working, but it will no longer log until such time as you
            reset the logging counters.  You can reset the logging
            counters with the <command>ipfw resetlog</command>
            command.  Alternatively, you may increase the log limit in
            your kernel configuration with the
            <option>IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT</option> option as
            described above.  You may also change this limit (without
	    recompiling your kernel and having to reboot) by using the
	    net.inet.ip.fw.verbose_limit &man.sysctl.8; value.</para>
        </answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>If I am using private addresses internally, such as in the
	    192.168.0.0 range, could I add a command like <literal>$fwcmd add
	      deny all from any to 192.168.0.0:255.255.0.0 via tun0</literal>
	    to the firewall rules to prevent outside attempts to connect to
	    internal machines?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The simple answer is no. The reason for this is that
	    <command>natd</command> is doing address translation for
	    <emphasis>anything</emphasis> being diverted through the
	    <devicename>tun0</devicename> device. As far as it is
	    concerned incoming packets will speak only to the
            dynamically assigned IP address and <emphasis>not</emphasis> to
            the internal network. Note though that you can add a rule like
	    <literal>$fwcmd add deny all from 192.168.0.4:255.255.0.0
	    to any via tun0</literal> which would limit a host on your
	    internal network from going out via the firewall.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>There must be something wrong.  I followed your instructions
	    to the letter and now I am locked out.</para>
        </question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This tutorial assumes that you are running
	    <emphasis>userland-ppp</emphasis>, therefore the supplied rule set
	    operates on the <devicename>tun0</devicename> interface, which
	    corresponds to the first connection made with &man.ppp.8; (a.k.a.
	    <emphasis>user-ppp</emphasis>).  Additional connections would use
	    <devicename>tun1</devicename>, <devicename>tun2</devicename> and so
	    on.</para>

	  <para>You should also note that &man.pppd.8; uses the
	    <devicename>ppp0</devicename> interface instead, so if you
	    start the connection with &man.pppd.8; you must substitute
	    <devicename>tun0</devicename> for
	    <devicename>ppp0</devicename>.  A quick way to edit the
	    firewall rules to reflect this change is shown below. The
	    original rule set is backed up as
	    <filename>fwrules_tun0</filename>.</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>cd /etc/firewall</userinput>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.user; <userinput>su</userinput>
	    <prompt>Password:</prompt>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.root; <userinput>mv fwrules fwrules_tun0</userinput>
	    /etc/firewall&prompt.root; <userinput>cat fwrules_tun0 | sed s/tun0/ppp0/g > fwrules</userinput>
	  </screen>

	  <para>To know whether you are currently using &man.ppp.8; or
	    &man.pppd.8; you can examine the output of
	    &man.ifconfig.8; once the connection is up. E.g., for a
	    connection made with &man.pppd.8; you would see something
	    like this (showing only the relevant lines):</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>ifconfig</userinput>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    ppp0: flags=<replaceable>8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1524</replaceable>
                    inet <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> --&gt; <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>0xff000000</replaceable>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    </screen>

	  <para>On the other hand, for a connection made with
	    &man.ppp.8; (<emphasis>user-ppp</emphasis>) you should see
	    something similar to this:</para>

	  <screen>	    &prompt.user; <userinput>ifconfig</userinput>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    ppp0: flags=<replaceable>8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500</replaceable>
	    <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis>
	    tun0: flags=<replaceable>8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1524</replaceable>
	            <emphasis>(IPv6 stuff skipped...)</emphasis>
                    inet <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> --&gt; <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> netmask <replaceable>0xffffff00</replaceable>
                    Opened by PID <replaceable>xxxxx</replaceable>
            <emphasis>(skipped...)</emphasis></screen>

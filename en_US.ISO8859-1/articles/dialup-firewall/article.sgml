    <abstract>
      <para>This article documents how to setup a firewall using a PPP
	dialup with FreeBSD and IPFW, and specifically with firewalling over
	a dialup with a dynamically assigned IP address.  This document does
	not cover setting up your PPP connection in the first place.</para>

    <para>Dialup Firewalling with FreeBSD</para>
    
    <para>This document aims to cover the process that is required in
      order to setup firewalling with FreeBSD when are dynamically 
      assigned an IP address by your ISP.  While every effort has been
      made to make this document as informative and correct as possible,
      you are welcome to mail your comments/suggestions to the

  <sect1 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Options</title>
    
    <para>The first thing you'll need to do is recompile your kernel in
      FreeBSD. If you need more information on how to recompile the kernel,
      then the best place to start is the <ulink
	URL="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	configuration section in the Handbook</ulink>. You need to compile the
      following options into the kernel: </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPFIREWALL</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Enables the kernel's firewall code.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Sends logged packets to the system logger.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options
	    IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=<replaceable>100</replaceable></literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Limits the number of times a matching entry is logged.  This
	    stops your log files filling up with lots of repetitive entries.
	    <replaceable>100</replaceable> is a reasonable number to use, but
	    you can adjust it based on your requirements.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options IPDIVERT</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Enables <emphasis>divert</emphasis> sockets, which will be
	    shown later.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>There are also some other OPTIONAL items that you can compile
     into the kernel for some added security.  These are not required in
     order to get firewalling to work, but some more paranoid users may
     want to use them.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options TCP_RESTRICT_RST</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This option blocks all TCP RST packets.  This is
	    best used for systems that might be exposed to SYN 
	    flooding (IRC Servers are a good example) or for those who 
     	    do not want to be easily portscannable.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>options TCP_DROP_SYNFIN</literal></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This option ignores TCP packets with SYN and FIN.  This
	   prevents tools such as nmap etc from identifying the TCP/IP
 	   stack of the machine, but breaks support for RFC1644
	   extensions.  This is NOT recommended if the machine will be
	   running a web server.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>

    <para>Don't reboot once you have recompiled the kernel. Hopefully, we will
      need to reboot just once in order to complete the installing of the
      firewall.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="rcconf">
    <title>Changing <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to load the
      firewall</title>
    
    <para>We now need to make some changes to
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> in order to tell it about the
      firewall. Simply add the following lines:</para>
    
    <programlisting>firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_script="/etc/firewall/fwrules"
natd_enable="YES"
natd_interface="tun0"
natd_flags="-dynamic"</programlisting>

    <para>For more information on what the above do take a look at
      <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> and read
      &man.rc.conf.5;</para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>Disable PPP's network address translation</title>
    
    <para>You may already be using PPP's built in network address
      translation (NAT).  If that is the case you will have to disable it,
      as these examples use &man.natd.8; to do the same.</para>

    <para>If you already have a block of entries to
      automatically start PPP it probably looks like this:</para>

    <programlisting>ppp_enable="YES"
ppp_mode="auto"
ppp_nat="YES"
ppp_profile="<replaceable>profile</replaceable>"</programlisting>

    <para>If so, remove the <literal>ppp_nat="YES"</literal> line.  You will 
      also need to remove any <literal>nat enable yes</literal> or
      <literal>alias enable yes</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="rules">
    <title>The ruleset for the firewall</title>
    
    <para>We're nearly done now. All that remains now is to define the
      firewall rules and then we can reboot and the firewall should be up and
      running. I realise that everyone will want something slightly different
      when it comes to their rulebase. What I've tried to do is write a
      rulebase that suits most dialup users. You can obviously modify it to
      your needs by  simply using the following rules as the foundation for
      your own rulebase.  First, let's start with the basics of closed
      firewalling. What you want to do is deny everything by default and then
      only open up for the  things you really need. Rules should be in the
      order of allow first and  then deny. The premise is that you add the
      rules for your allows, and  then everything else is denied. :)</para>

    <para>Now, let's make the dir /etc/firewall. Change into the directory and
      edit the file fwrules as we specified in rc.conf. Please note that you
      can change this filename to be anything you wish. This guide just gives
      an  example of a filename. </para>

    <para>Now, let's look at a sample firewall file, and we'll detail
      everything in it. </para>

    <programlisting># Firewall rules
# Written by Marc Silver (marcs@draenor.org)
# http://draenor.org/ipfw
# Freely distributable 


# Define the firewall command (as in /etc/rc.firewall) for easy
# reference.  Helps to make it easier to read.
fwcmd="/sbin/ipfw"

# Force a flushing of the current rules before we reload.
$fwcmd -f flush

# Divert all packets through the tunnel interface.
$fwcmd add divert natd all from any to any via tun0

# Allow all data from my network card and localhost.  Make sure you
# change your network card (mine was fxp0) before you reboot.  :)
$fwcmd add allow ip from any to any via lo0
$fwcmd add allow ip from any to any via fxp0

# Allow all connections that I initiate.
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to any out xmit tun0 setup

# Once connections are made, allow them to stay open.
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to any via tun0 established

# Everyone on the internet is allowed to connect to the following
# services on the machine.  This example shows that people may connect
# to ssh and apache.
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to any 80 setup
$fwcmd add allow tcp from any to any 22 setup

# This sends a RESET to all ident packets.
$fwcmd add reset log tcp from any to any 113 in recv tun0

# Allow outgoing DNS queries ONLY to the specified servers.
$fwcmd add allow udp from any to <replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable> 53 out xmit tun0

# Allow them back in with the answers...  :)
$fwcmd add allow udp from <replaceable>x.x.x.x</replaceable> 53 to any in recv tun0

# Allow ICMP (for ping and traceroute to work).  You may wish to
# disallow this, but I feel it suits my needs to keep them in.
$fwcmd add 65435 allow icmp from any to any

# Deny all the rest.
$fwcmd add 65435 deny log ip from any to any</programlisting>

    <para>You now have a fully functional firewall that will allow on
      connections to ports 80 and 22 and will log any other connection
      attempts. Now, you should be able to safely reboot and your firewall 
      should come up fine. If you find this incorrect in anyway or experience 
      any problems, or have any suggestions to improve this page, please 
      email me.</para>

    <title>Questions</title>
    
    <qandaset>
      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>Why are you using natd and ipfw when you could be using
	    the built in ppp-filters?</para>
	</question>
	
	<answer>
	  <para>I'll have to be honest and say there's no definitive reason
	    why I use ipfw and natd instead of the built in ppp  filters. From
	    the discussions I've had with people the consensus  seems to be
	    that while ipfw is certainly more powerful and more configurable
	    than the ppp filters, what it makes up for in functionality it
	    loses in being easy to customise.  One of the reasons I use it is
	    because I prefer firewalling to be done at a kernel level rather
	    than by a userland program.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>If I'm using private addresses internally, such as in the
	    192.168.0.0 range, Could I add a command like <literal>$fwcmd add
	      deny all from any to 192.168.0.0:255.255.0.0 via tun0</literal>
	    to the firewall rules to prevent outside attempts to connect to
	    internal machines?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The simple answer is no. The reason for this is that natd is
	    doing address translation for <emphasis>anything</emphasis> being
	    diverted through the tun0 device. As far as it's concerned
	    incoming packets will speak only to the dynamically assigned IP
	    address and NOT to the internal network. Note though that you can
	    add a rule like <literal>$fwcmd add deny all from
	      192.168.0.4:255.255.0.0 to any via tun0</literal> which would
	    limit a host on your internal network from going out via the
	    firewall.</para>

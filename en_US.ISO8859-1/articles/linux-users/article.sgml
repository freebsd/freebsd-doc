    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document will highlight the differences between &os; and
      &linux; so that intermediate to advanced &linux; users can quickly
      familiarize themselves with the basics of &os;.  This is just a
      technical quickstart, it does not attempt to design
      <quote>philosophical</quote> differences between the two
      operating systems.</para>

    <para>This document assumes that you have already installed &os;.
      If you have not installed &os; or need help with the installation
      process please refer to the
      <ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html">
      Installing FreeBSD</ulink> chapter of the &os;&nbsp;Handbook.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="shells">
    <title>Shells: No Bash?</title>

    <para>Those coming from &linux; are often surprised to find that
      <application>Bash</application> is not the default shell in &os;.
      In fact, <application>Bash</application> is not even in the default
      installation.  Instead, &os; uses &man.tcsh.1; as the default shell.
      Although, <application>Bash</application> and your other favorite
      shells are available in &os;'s <ulink
	url="article.html#SOFTWARE">Packages and Ports&nbsp;Collection</ulink>.</para>

    <para>If you do install other shells you can use &man.chsh.1; to set
      a user's default shell.  It is, however, recommended that the
      <username>root</username>'s default shell remain unchanged.  The
      reason for this is that shells not included in the base distribution
      are normally installed in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> or
      <filename>/usr/bin</filename>.  In the event of a problem the file
      systems where <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> and
      <filename>/usr/bin</filename> are located may not be mounted.  In this
      case <username>root</username> would not have access to its default
      shell, preventing <username>root</username> from logging in.  For this
      reason a second <username>root</username> account, the
      <username>toor</username> account, was created for use with non-default
      shells.  See the security FAQ for information regarding the <ulink
	url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/security.html#TOOR-ACCOUNT">toor account</ulink>.</para>

  <sect1 id="software">
    <title>Packages and Ports: Adding software in &os;</title>

    <para>In addition to the traditional &unix; method of installing software
      (download source, extract, edit source code, and compile), &os; offers
      two other methods for installing applications: packages and ports.  A
      complete list of of all available ports and packages can be found <ulink
	url="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/master-index.html">here</ulink>.</para>

    <sect2 id="packages">
      <title>Packages</title>

      <para>Packages are pre-compiled applications, the &os; equivalents
	of <filename>.deb</filename> files on Debian/Ubuntu based systems
	and <filename>.rpm</filename> files on Red&nbsp;Hat/Fedora based
	systems.  Packages are installed using &man.pkg.add.1;.  For example,
	the following command installs
	<application>Apache 2.2</application>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add <replaceable>/tmp/apache-2.2.6_2.tbz</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Using the <option>-r</option> switch will tell &man.pkg.add.1;
	to automatically fetch a package and install it, as well as any
	dependencies:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r <replaceable>apache22</replaceable></userinput>
Fetching ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-6.2-release/Latest/apache22.tbz... Done.
Fetching ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-6.2-release/All/expat-2.0.0_1.tbz... Done.
Fetching ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-6.2-release/All/perl-5.8.8_1.tbz... Done.
[snip]

To run apache www server from startup, add apache22_enable="YES"
in your /etc/rc.conf. Extra options can be found in startup script.</screen>

      <note>
	<para>If you are running a release version of &os; (6.2, 6.3, 7.0,
	  etc., generally installed from CD-ROM) <command>pkg_add -r</command>
	  will download packages built for that specific release.  These
	  packages <emphasis>may not</emphasis> be the most up-to-date
	  version of the application.  You can use the
	  <envar>PACKAGESITE</envar> variable to override this default
	  behavior.  For example, set <envar>PACKAGESITE</envar> to
          <ulink url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-6-stable/Latest/"></ulink>
          to download the most recent packages built for the
	  6.X series.</para>

        <para>You can read more about the &os; versions in the article
	  <ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/version-guide/">
	    Choosing the &os; Version That Is Right For You</ulink>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>For more information on packages please refer to section 4.4 of
	the &os; Handbook: <ulink
	  url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">Using the Packages System</ulink>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="ports">
      <title>Ports</title>

      <para>&os;'s second method for installing applications is the
	Ports&nbsp;Collection.  The Ports&nbsp;Collection is a framework of
	<filename>Makefiles</filename> and patches specifically customized
	for installing various software applications from source on &os;.
	When installing a port the system will fetch the source code, apply
	any required patches, compile the code, and install the application
	(and do the same for any dependencies).</para>

      <para>The Ports&nbsp;Collection, sometimes referred to as the ports tree,
	can be found in <filename>/usr/ports</filename>.  That is assuming
	the Ports&nbsp;Collection was installed during the &os; installation
	process.  If the Ports&nbsp;Collection has not been installed it can be
	added from the installation discs using &man.sysinstall.8;, or pulled
	from the &os; servers using &man.csup.1; or &man.portsnap.8;.
	Detailed instructions for installing the Ports&nbsp;Collection can be
	found in <ulink
	  url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">section 4.5.1</ulink>
	of the handbook.</para>

      <para>Installing a port is as simple (generally) as changing in to the
	port's directory and starting the build process.  The following example
	installs <application>Apache 2.2</application> from the
	Ports&nbsp;Collection:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/www/apache22</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>A major benefit of using ports to install software is the
	ability to customize the installation options.  For example, when
	installing <application>Apache 2.2</application> from ports you can
	enable <application>mod_ldap</application> by setting the
	<makevar>WITH_LDAP</makevar> &man.make.1; variable:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/www/apache22</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make WITH_LDAP="YES" install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>Please see section 4.5 of the &os; Handbook, <ulink
	 url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">Using
	 the Ports&nbsp;Collection</ulink>, for more information about the
	Ports&nbsp;Collection.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="which">
      <title>Ports or packages, which one should I use?</title>

      <para>Packages are just pre-compiled ports, so it is really a matter
	of installing from source (ports) versus installing from binary
	packages.  Each method has its own benefits:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<title>Packages (binary)</title>

	<listitem><simpara>Faster installation (compiling large applications
	  can take quite a while).</simpara></listitem>

	<listitem><simpara>You do not need to understand how to compile
	  software.</simpara></listitem>

	<listitem><simpara>No need to install compilers on your
	  system.</simpara></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	<title>Ports (source)</title>

	<listitem><simpara>Ability to customize installation options.
	  (Packages are normally built with standard options.  With ports
	  you can customize various options, such as building additional
	  modules or changing the default path.)</simpara></listitem>

	<listitem><simpara>You can apply your own patches if you are so
	  inclined.</simpara></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you do not have any special requirements, packages will
	probably suit your situation just fine.  If you may ever need to
	customize, ports are the way to go.  (And remember, if you
	need to customize but prefer packages, you can build a custom
	package from ports using <command>make</command>
	<maketarget>package</maketarget> and then copy the package to
	other servers.)</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="startup">
    <title>System Startup: Where are the run-levels?</title>

    <para>&linux; uses the SysV init system, whereas &os; uses the
      traditional BSD-style &man.init.8;.  Under the BSD-style &man.init.8;
      there are no run-levels and no <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>,
      instead startup is controlled by the &man.rc.8; utility.  The
      <filename>/etc/rc</filename> script reads
      <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> to determine which services are to be
      started.  The specified services are then started by running the
      corresponding service initialization scripts located in
      <filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename> and
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/</filename>.  These scripts are similar to
      the scripts located in <filename>/etc/init.d/</filename> on &linux;
      systems.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <para><emphasis>Why are there two locations for service initialization
	scripts?</emphasis>  The scripts found in
	<filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename> are for applications that are part of
	the <quote>base</quote> system.  (&man.cron.8;, &man.sshd.8;,
	&man.syslog.3;, and others.)  The scripts in
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/</filename> are for user-installed
	applications such as <application>Apache</application>,
	<application>Squid</application>, etc.</para>

      <para><emphasis>What is the difference between the <quote>base</quote>
	system and user-installed applications?</emphasis>  FreeBSD is
	developed as a complete operating system.  In other words, the
	kernel, system libraries, and userland utilities (such as &man.ls.1;,
	&man.cat.1;, &man.cp.1;, etc.) are developed and released together as
	one.  This is what is referred to as the <quote>base</quote> system.
	The user-installed applications are applications that are not part of
	the <quote>base</quote> system, such as
	<application>Apache</application>, <application>X11</application>,
	<application>Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</application>, etc.  These
	user-installed applications are generally installed using &os;'s <ulink
	  url="article.html#SOFTWARE">Packages and Ports&nbsp;Collection</ulink>.
	In order to keep them separate from the <quote>base</quote> system,
	user-installed applications are normally installed under
	<filename>/usr/local/</filename>.  Therefore the user-installed
	binaries reside in <filename>/usr/local/bin/</filename>,
	configuration files are in <filename>/usr/local/etc/</filename>,
	and so on.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Services are enabled by specifying
      <literal><replaceable>ServiceName</replaceable>_enable="YES"</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> (&man.rc.conf.5;).  Take a look at
      <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> for the system defaults,
      these default settings are overridden by settings in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  Also, when installing additional
      applications be sure to review the documentation to determine how to
      enable any associated services.</para>

    <para>The following snippet from <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> enables
      &man.sshd.8; and <application>Apache 2.2</application>.  It also
      specifies that <application>Apache</application> should be started
      with SSL.</para>

    <programlisting># enable SSHD
sshd_enable="YES"
# enable Apache with SSL
apache22_enable="YES"
apache22_flags="-DSSL"</programlisting>

    <para>Once a service has been enabled in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>,
      the service can be started from the command line (without rebooting the
      system):</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><replaceable>/etc/rc.d/sshd</replaceable> start</userinput></screen>

    <para>If a service has not been enabled it can be started from the
      command line using <option>forcestart</option>:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput><replaceable>/etc/rc.d/sshd</replaceable> forcestart</userinput></screen>

  <sect1 id="network">
    <title>Network configuration</title>

    <sect2 id="interfaces">
      <title>Network Interfaces</title>

      <para>Instead of a generic <emphasis>ethX</emphasis> identifier that
	&linux; uses to identify a network interface, &os; uses the driver
	name followed by a number as the identifier.  The following output
	from &man.ifconfig.8; shows two &intel&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;1000 network
	interfaces (em0 and em1):</para>

    <sect2 id="ipaddress">
      <title>IP Configuration</title>

      <para>An IP address can be assigned to an interface using
	&man.ifconfig.8;.  However, to remain persistent across reboots the
	IP configuration must be included in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  The following example
	specifies the hostname, IP address, and default gateway:</para>

      <programlisting>hostname="server1.example.com"
ifconfig_em0="inet 10.10.10.100  netmask 255.255.255.0"

    <title>Firewall</title>

    <para>Like <application>IPTABLES</application> in &linux;, &os; also offers
      a kernel level firewall; actually &os; offers three firewalls:</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para><application>IPFIREWALL</application> or
      <application>IPFW</application> (the command to manage an
      <application>IPFW</application> ruleset is &man.ipfw.8;) is the
      firewall developed and maintained by the &os; developers.
      <application>IPFW</application> can be paired with &man.dummynet.4; to
      provide traffic shaping capabilities and simulate different types of
      network connections.</para>

    <para>Sample <application>IPFW</application> rule to allow
      <application>SSH</application> in:</para>

    <programlisting>ipfw add allow tcp from any to me 22 in via $ext_if</programlisting>

    <para><application>IPFILTER</application> is the firewall application
      developed by Darren&nbsp;Reed.  It is not specific to &os;, and has been
      ported to several operating systems including NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS,
      HP/UX, and Solaris.</para>

    <para>Sample <application>IPFILTER</application> command to allow
      <application>SSH</application> in:</para>

    <programlisting>pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port = 22</programlisting>

    <para>The last firewall application, <application>PF</application>, is
      developed by the OpenBSD project.  <application>PF</application> was
      created as a replacement for <application>IPFILTER</application>.  As
      such, the <application>PF</application> syntax is very similar to that of
      <application>IPFILTER</application>.  <application>PF</application> can
      be paired with &man.altq.4; to provide QoS features.</para>

     <para>Sample <application>PF</application> command to allow

  <sect1 id="updates">
    <title>Updating &os;</title>

    <para>There are three methods for updating a &os; system: from source,
      binary updates, and the installation discs.</para>

    <para>Updating from source is the most involved update method, but offers
      the greatest amount of flexibility.  The process involves synchronizing a
      local copy of the FreeBSD source code with the &os;
      <application>CVS</application> (Concurrent Versioning System) servers.
      Once the local source code is up to date you can build new versions of
      the kernel and userland.  For more information on source updates see
      <ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/updating-upgrading.html">the chapter on updating</ulink>
      in the &os;&nbsp;Handbook.</para>

    <para>Binary updates are similar to using <command>yum</command> or
     <command>apt-get</command> to update a &linux; system.  The command
     &man.freebsd-update.8; will fetch new updates and install them.  The
     updates can be scheduled using &man.cron.8;.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you do use &man.cron.8; to schedule the updates, please be sure
	to use <command>freebsd-update cron</command> in your &man.crontab.1;
	to reduce the possibility of a large number of machines all pulling
	updates at the same time.</para>

      <programlisting>0 3 * * * root /usr/sbin/freebsd-update cron</programlisting>
    </note>

    <para>The last update method, updating from the installation discs, is a
      straight-forward process.  Boot from the installation discs and select
      the option to upgrade.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="procfs">
    <title>procfs: Gone But Not Forgotten</title>

    <para>In &linux;, you may have looked at
      <filename>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</filename> to determine if
      IP forwarding was enabled.  Under &os; you should use &man.sysctl.8; to
      view this and other system settings, as &man.procfs.5; has been
      deprecated in current versions of &os;.  (Although
      <command>sysctl</command> is available in &linux; as well.)</para>

    <para>In the IP forwarding example, you would use the following to
      determine if IP forwarding is enabled on your FreeBSD system:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding</userinput>
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0</screen>

      <ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html">&linux; Binary Compatibility</ulink>.
      (Although, &linux; Binary Compatibility uses its own procfs, &man.linprocfs.5;.)
      If you need to mount procfs you can add the following to

      <para>So you have chosen to install &os;.  Welcome!  This
	document is designed to help you to decide which version to
	install.</para>
    </abstract>
  </articleinfo>

  <sect1 id="background">
    <title>Background</title>

    <para>To decide which version of &os; is the best for your needs,
      it's important to understand a few concepts about our development
      and Release Engineering (<literal>RE</literal>) processes.</para>

    <para>&os; is developed by a large group of individuals who are
      almost entirely volunteers.  The source code to the kernel and
      the most common libraries and utilities is maintained in a
      <firstterm>source control system</firstterm> and available for
      the general public to download at any time.  Separately, compiled
      versions (<literal>binaries</literal>) are made available on a
      recurring basis.  Some of these binary versions undergo an
      extensive testing process and are then termed a
      <firstterm>release</firstterm>.</para>

    <sect2 id="releases">
      <title>Releases</title>

      <para><literal>Releases</literal> are named with a <firstterm>major
	version number</firstterm> and <firstterm>minor version
	number</firstterm>.<para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The goal of a major release is to introduce a set of new
	    features.  Where necessary, it may be necessary to break
	    compatibility with previous major releases in order to advance
	    the state of &os;, or, occasionally, to drop features that
	    it is no longer feasible to support.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The goal of a minor release is primarily to fix bugs and
	    improve performance and stability.  Keeping compatibility
	    from one minor release to another is a priority.  On occasion,
	    new features may be added to a minor release when it is
	    believed that these other goals will not be compromised.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>However, keep in mind that a <literal>release version</literal>
	is merely a snapshot of the source tree at a particular point in
	time which is given a particular name (or <literal>tag</literal>).
	(For instance, the tag that Release Engineering assigned for the
	5.4 release was <literal>RELENG_5_4_RELEASE</literal>.) Development
	always continues on what is known as the <literal>HEAD</literal>
	tag.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="branches">
      <title>Branches</title>

      <para>At the time of each release, a <firstterm>branch</firstterm>
	is created, such as <literal>RELENG_5_4</literal>.  Although
	the source files named by <literal>RELENG_5_4_RELEASE</literal>
	will never change, those on <literal>RELENG_5_4</literal> can,
	by the adoption of changes from <literal>HEAD</literal> such
	as fixes for security and other bugs.</para>

      <para>During the life of each major release, another tag is
	created such as <literal>RELENG_5</literal>.  In addition
	to security and other bug fixes, other new changes can be
	brought in from <literal>HEAD</literal> so as to constitute
	the changes for the next minor release in the sequence.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="stable-vs-current">
      <title><firstterm>STABLE</firstterm> versus
	<firstterm>CURRENT</firstterm></title>

      <para>During the lifetime of each major release, an individual
	branch may also be termed <literal>STABLE</literal>.  This
	indicates that the &os; Project believes that the branch is
	of sufficiently proven quality to be used by a wide range of
	users.  Branches that need further testing before being widely
	adopted are named <literal>CURRENT</literal>.</para>

      <note><para>The &os; Project cannot in and of itself guarantee
	that the software that it ships is <emphasis>stable</emphasis>
	enough for any given installation.  Only each individual user
	can make that decision.  Please keep in mind that the Project
	is primarily composed of volunteers and is not able to offer
	any kind of warranty of fitness.</para></note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="ports-vs-packages">
      <title><firstterm>Ports</firstterm> versus
	<firstterm>Packages</firstterm></title>

      <para>Separately from the files distributed above, &os;
	supports thousands of applications that are developed by third
	parties outside of the project itself.  (Examples include
	windowing systems, Internet browsers, email programs, office
	suites, and so forth.)  In general, the project itself does
	not develop this software, only the framework to allow these
	programs to be installed (termed the <firstterm>Ports
	Collection</firstterm>).  Applications may be installed
	either from source, if its licensing terms allow such
	redistribution (these are termed <literal>ports</literal>),
	or as compiled binaries if allowed (these are termed
	<literal>packages</literal>).</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="past-schedules">
    <title>Release Scheduling In The Past</title>

    <para>During the development and release of &os; 5.X, many lessons
      were learned which only became clear in retrospect.  The goals
      of the 5.X series were very aggressive, and included:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>To provide support for Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP)
	  machines;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To increase performance by adopting a new strategy
	  for dealing with resource contention in the kernel;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To add several new processor architectures;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To introduce a new threading model;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To introduce a new scheduler;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To add support for new technologies such as power
	  management (especially important for laptops); and,
	  most critically,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Not to declare the release series as <literal>STABLE</literal>
	  until all these tasks were finished.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This led to a situation where it was several years between
      the time that a release in the 4.X series was declared
      <literal>STABLE</literal> and that a release in the 5.X series
      was declared <literal>STABLE</literal>.  This had several
      undesirable effects:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The number of simultaneous feature-set changes made it
	  very difficult to isolate one set of changes for merging
	  back into the <literal>STABLE</literal> branch;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>which meant that users who absolutely had to have certain
	  new features (for instance, to be able to run on modern hardware)
	  wound up adopting (for instance) &os; 5.2.1 even though it was
	  advertised as a developer-only release, and regardless of the
	  fact that a <literal>CURRENT</literal> release was not really
	  suitable for their needs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>In the cases where backmerges were made, this put the
	  developers in a position of trying to support features on a
	  version that they themselves were not using as their primary
	  development platform.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The time lag also meant that when 5.3 was finally declared
	  as the latest <literal>STABLE</literal> release, the accumulated
	  weight of changes made the upgrading process very painful.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To put it bluntly, no one was satisfied with this result.</para>

    <para>The lessons that were learned are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>New major releases must have a smaller number of
	  feature-set changes and be released more often.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To the maximum extent possible, feature-set changes
	  should be isolated from each other.  (This implies that
	  some development must take place outside of the main
	  tree and only be merged in when it will not destabilize
	  other simultaneous development.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Major releases should be targeted at a time
	  deadline rather than a feature-set deadline.  If some
	  feature is not ready in time, then it should be disabled
	  by default and left for the next major release.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By releasing smaller sets of changes more often, it is
      also hoped that less time will be spent trying to merge features
      from <literal>HEAD</literal> back into the latest
      <literal>STABLE</literal> version (and thus trying to support
      those features in more than one major version); and further, that
      as the changes are more isolated, that the risk of introducing
      more bugs by doing so is much less.</para>

    <para>Also, by focusing on a time deadline rather than a
      feature set, it should be finally be possible for users, developers
      of external applications, and the &os; developers themselves to
      be able to better plan for the future.</para>

    <para>These considerations, rather than any kind of keeping up with
      the major release number of any other OS, comprise the main motivation for
      the scheduling changes going forward.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="future-goals">
    <title>Release Scheduling Goals Going Forward</title>

    <para>Here are the current scheduling goals for the Project:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>To release a new major release every 18 months;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To release a new minor release every 4 months;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To provide prebuilt packages for the most recent minor
	  version of each major version;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To provide prebuilt packages for the most recent minor
	  release of each major version;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>To provide security updates and other critical bug fixes
	  for the last several minor versions of each major version
	  (termed <firstterm>security branches</firstterm>).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Due to the large number of possible combinations of installable
      versions, it is not possible to support every version
      indefinitely; this is due somewhat to the availability of machine
      resources but primarily due to the amount of volunteer effort
      that is available.</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you have a short-term need, need the highest degree of

      <listitem>
	<para>If you have a short-term need, and feature completeness or
	  the best levels of security are most important to you, and you

	  latest <literal>STABLE</literal> branch.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you are not immediately planning on going into
	  production, you are willing to work through a certain number
	  of problems, and a new major release is upcoming within the
	  next few months, you may wish to investigate installing that
	  branch to help the project to test it and stabilize it
	  to make it the best release possible in the medium to long
	  term.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Only if you are willing to install from source, and spend
	  time debugging problems with the base system and follow up
	  with problem reports, and track the mailing list that deals
	  with such issues, should you consider tracking
	  <literal>HEAD</literal>.</para>

      <para>These guidelines describe recommended handling practices
	for FreeBSD Problem Reports (PRs).  Whilst developed for the
	FreeBSD PR Database Maintenance Team
	<email>freebsd-bugbusters@FreeBSD.org</email>, these
	guidelines should be followed by anyone working with FreeBSD

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Bugzilla is an issue management system used by
      the &os; Project.  As accurate tracking of outstanding
      software defects is important to FreeBSD's quality, the
      correct use of the software is essential to the forward
      progress of the Project.</para>

    <para>Access to Bugzilla is available to the entire &os;
      community.  In order to maintain consistency within
      the database and provide a consistent user experience, guidelines
      have been established covering common aspects of bug management
      such as presenting followup, handling close requests, and so
      forth.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pr-lifecycle">
    <title>Problem Report Life-cycle</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The Reporter submits a bug report on the website.  The
	bug is in the <literal>Needs Triage</literal> state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Jane Random BugBuster confirms that the bug report has
	  sufficient information to be reproducible.  If not, she goes
	  back and forth with the reporter to obtain the needed
	  information.  At this point the bug is set to the
	  <literal>Open</literal> state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe Random Committer takes interest in the PR and
	  assigns it to himself, or Jane Random BugBuster decides that
	  Joe is best suited to handle it and assigns it to
	  him.  The bug should be set to the <literal>In
	  Discussion</literal> state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe has a brief exchange with the originator (making
	  sure it all goes into the audit trail) and determines the
	  cause of the problem.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe pulls an all-nighter and whips up a patch that he
	  thinks fixes the problem, and submits it in a follow-up,
	  asking the originator to test it.  He then sets the PRs
	  state to <literal>Patch Ready</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A couple of iterations later, both Joe and the
	  originator are satisfied with the patch, and Joe commits it
	  to <literal>-CURRENT</literal> (or directly to
	  <literal>-STABLE</literal> if the problem does not exist in
	  <literal>-CURRENT</literal>), making sure to reference the
	  Problem Report in his commit log (and credit the originator
	  if they submitted all or part of the patch) and, if
	  appropriate, start an MFC countdown.  The bug is set to the
	  <literal>Needs MFC</literal> state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If the patch does not need MFCing, Joe then closes the
	  PR as <literal>Issue Resolved</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>Many PRs are submitted with very little information about
	the problem, and some are either very complex to solve, or
	just scratch the surface of a larger problem; in these cases, it
	is very important to obtain all the necessary information
	needed to solve the problem.  If the problem contained within
	cannot be solved, or has occurred again, it is necessary to
	re-open the PR.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pr-states">
    <title>Problem Report State</title>

    <para>It is important to update the state of a PR when certain
      actions are taken.  The state should accurately reflect the
      current state of work on the PR.</para>

    <example>
      <title>A small example on when to change PR state</title>

      <para>When a PR has been worked on and the developer(s)
	responsible feel comfortable about the fix, they will submit a
	followup to the PR and change its state to
	<quote>feedback</quote>.  At this point, the originator should
	evaluate the fix in their context and respond indicating
	whether the defect has indeed been remedied.</para>
    </example>

    <para>A Problem Report may be in one of the following
      states:</para>

    <glosslist>
      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>open</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>Initial state; the problem has been pointed out and it
	    needs reviewing.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>analyzed</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>The problem has been reviewed and a
	solution is being sought.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>feedback</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>Further work requires additional information from the
	    originator or the community; possibly information
	    regarding the proposed solution.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>patched</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>A patch has been committed, but something (MFC, or
	    maybe confirmation from originator) is still pending.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>suspended</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>The problem is not being worked on, due to lack of
	    information or resources.  This is a prime candidate for
	    somebody who is looking for a project to take on.  If the
	    problem cannot be solved at all, it will be closed, rather
	    than suspended.  The documentation project uses
	    <quote>suspended</quote> for <quote>wish-list</quote>
	    items that entail a significant amount of work which no one
	    currently has time for.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>closed</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>A problem report is closed when any changes have been
	    integrated, documented, and tested, or when fixing the
	    problem is abandoned.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>
    </glosslist>

    <note>
      <para>The <quote>patched</quote> state is directly related to
	feedback, so you may go directly to <quote>closed</quote> state if
	the originator cannot test the patch, and it works in your own testing.</para>
    </note>

  <section xml:id="pr-types">
    <title>Types of Problem Reports</title>

    <para>While handling problem reports, either as a developer who has
      direct access to the Problem Reports database or as a contributor who
      browses the database and submits followups with patches, comments,
      suggestions or change requests, you will come across several
      different types of PRs.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-unassigned">PRs not yet assigned to anyone.</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-assigned">PRs already assigned to someone.</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-dups">Duplicates of existing PRs.</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-stale">Stale PRs</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-misfiled-notpr">Non-Bug PRs</link></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following sections describe what each different type of
      PRs is used for, when a PR belongs to one of these types, and what
      treatment each different type receives.</para>

    <section xml:id="pr-unassigned">
      <title>Unassigned PRs</title>

      <para>When PRs arrive, they are initially assigned to a generic
	(placeholder) assignee.  These are always prepended with
	<literal>freebsd-</literal>.  The exact value for this default
	depends on the category; in most cases, it corresponds to a
	specific &os; mailing list.  Here is the current list, with
	the most common ones listed first:</para>

      <para>Do not be surprised to find that the submitter of the
	PR has assigned it to the wrong category.  If you fix the
	category, do not forget to fix the assignment as well.
	(In particular, our submitters seem to have a hard time
	understanding that just because their problem manifested
	on an i386 system, that it might be generic to all of &os;,
	and thus be more appropriate for <literal>kern</literal>.
	The converse is also true, of course.)</para>

      <para>Certain PRs may be reassigned away from these generic
	assignees by anyone.  There are several types of assignees:
	specialized mailing lists; mail aliases (used for certain
	limited-interest items); and individuals.</para>

      <para>For assignees which are mailing lists,
	please use the long form when making the assignment (e.g.,
	<literal>freebsd-foo</literal> instead of <literal>foo</literal>);
	this will avoid duplicate emails sent to the mailing list.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Since the list of individuals who have volunteered to
	  be the default assignee for certain types of PRs changes
	  so often, it is much more suitable for <link xlink:href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/AssigningPRs">the FreeBSD wiki</link>.
	  </para>

      <para>Ports PRs which have a maintainer who is a ports committer

      <para>For other PRs, please do not reassign them to individuals

      <para>If a PR has the <literal>responsible</literal> field set
	to the username of a FreeBSD developer, it means that the PR
	has been handed over to that particular person for further
	work.</para>

      <para>Assigned PRs should not be touched by anyone but the
	assignee or bugmeister.  If you have comments, submit a followup.  If for
	some reason you think the PR should change state or be
	reassigned, send a message to the assignee.  If the assignee
	does not respond within two weeks, unassign the PR and do as
	you please.</para>

      <para>If you find more than one PR that describe the same issue,
	choose the one that contains the largest amount of useful
	information and close the others, stating clearly the number
	of the superseding PR.  If several PRs contain non-overlapping
	useful information, submit all the missing information to one
	in a followup, including references to the others; then close

      <title>Stale PRs</title>

      <para>A PR is considered stale if it has not been modified in more
	than six months.  Apply the following procedure to deal with
	stale PRs:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR contains sufficient detail, try to reproduce
	    the problem in <literal>-CURRENT</literal> and
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>.  If you succeed, submit a
	    followup detailing your findings and try to find someone
	    to assign it to.  Set the state to <quote>analyzed</quote>
	    if appropriate.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an issue which you know is the
	    result of a usage error (incorrect configuration or
	    otherwise), submit a followup explaining what the
	    originator did wrong, then close the PR with the reason
	    <quote>User error</quote> or <quote>Configuration
	    error</quote>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an error which you know has been
	    corrected in both <literal>-CURRENT</literal> and
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>, close it with a message
	    stating when it was fixed in each branch.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an error which you know has been
	    corrected in <literal>-CURRENT</literal>, but not in
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>, try to find out when the person
	    who corrected it is planning to MFC it, or try to find
	    someone else (maybe yourself?) to do it.  Set the state to
	    <quote>patched</quote> and assign it to whomever will do
	    the MFC.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In other cases, ask the originator to confirm if
	    the problem still exists in newer versions.  If the
	    originator does not reply within a month, close the PR
	    with the notation <quote>Feedback timeout</quote>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

      <section xml:id="pr-misfiled-notpr">
	<title>Non-Bug PRs</title>

	<para>Developers that come across PRs that look like they should have
	  been posted to &a.bugs.name; or some other list should close the
	  PR, informing the submitter in a comment why this
	  is not really a PR and where the message should be posted.</para>

	<para>The email addresses that Bugzilla listens to for incoming PRs
	  have been published as part of the FreeBSD documentation, have
	  been announced and listed on the web-site.  This means that
	  spammers found them.</para>

	<para>Whenever you close one of these PRs, please do the
	  following:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Set the component to <literal>junk</literal> (under
		<literal>Supporting Services</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Set Responsible to <literal>nobody@FreeBSD.org</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Set State to <literal>Issue Resolved</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Setting the category to <literal>junk</literal> makes it
	  obvious that there is no useful content within the PR, and
	  helps to reduce the clutter within the main categories.</para>

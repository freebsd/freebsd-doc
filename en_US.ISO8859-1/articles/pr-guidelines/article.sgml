    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>GNATS is a defect management (bug reporting) system used by
      the FreeBSD Project.  As accurate tracking of outstanding
      software defects is important to FreeBSD's quality, the
      correct use of GNATS is essential to the forward progress of the
      Project.</para>

    <para>Access to GNATS is available to FreeBSD developers, as well as
      to the wider community.  In order to maintain consistency within
      the database and provide a consistent user experience, guidelines
      have been established covering common aspects of bug management
      such as presenting followup, handling close requests, and so
      forth.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The Reporter submits a PR with &man.send-pr.1; and
	  receives a confirmation message.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe Random Committer takes interest in the PR and
	  assigns it to himself, or Jane Random BugBuster decides that
	  Joe is best suited to handle it and assigns it to
	  him.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe has a brief exchange with the originator (making
	  sure it all goes into the audit trail) and determines the
	  cause of the problem.  He then makes sure the cause is
	  documented in the audit trail, and sets the PRs state to
	  <quote>analyzed</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Joe pulls an all-nighter and whips up a patch that he
	  thinks fixes the problem, and submits it in a follow-up,
	  asking the originator to test it.  He then sets the PRs
	  state to <quote>feedback</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A couple of iterations later, both Joe and the
	  originator are satisfied with the patch, and Joe commits it
	  to <literal>-CURRENT</literal> (or directly to
	  <literal>-STABLE</literal> if the problem does not exist in
	  <literal>-CURRENT</literal>), making sure to reference the
	  Problem Report in his commit log (and credit the originator
	  if he submitted all or part of the patch) and, if
	  appropriate, start an MFC countdown.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If the patch does not need MFCing, Joe then closes the
	  PR.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If the patch needs MFCing, Joe leaves the Problem Report
	  in <quote>patched</quote> state until the patch has been
	  MFCed, then closes it.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>Many PRs are submitted with very little information about
	the problem, and some are either very complex to solve, or
	just scratch the surface of a larger problem; in these cases, it
	is very important to obtain all the necessary information
	needed to solve the problem.  If the problem contained within
	cannot be solved, or has occurred again, it is necessary to
	re-open the PR.</para>
    </note>
    <note>
      <para>The <quote>email address</quote> used on the PR might not
	be able to receive mail.  In this case, followup to the PR as
	usual and ask the originator (in the followup) to provide a
	working email address.  This is normally the case when
	&man.send-pr.1; is used from a system with the mail system
	disabled or not installed.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-states">
    <title>Problem Report State</title>

    <para>It is important to update the state of a PR when certain
      actions are taken.  The state should accurately reflect the
      current state of work on the PR.</para>

    <example>
      <title>A small example on when to change PR state</title>

      <para>When a PR has been worked on and the developer(s)
	responsible feel comfortable about the fix, they will submit a
	followup to the PR and change its state to
	<quote>feedback</quote>.  At this point, the originator should
	evaluate the fix in their context and respond indicating
	whether the defect has indeed been remedied.</para>
    </example>

    <para>A Problem Report may be in one of the following
      states:</para>

    <glosslist>
      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>open</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>Initial state; the problem has been pointed out and it
	    needs reviewing.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>analyzed</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>The problem has been reviewed and a
	solution is being sought.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>feedback</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>Further work requires additional information from the
	    originator or the community; possibly information
	    regarding the proposed solution.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>patched</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>A patch has been committed, but something (MFC, or
	    maybe confirmation from originator) is still pending.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>suspended</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>The problem is not being worked on, due to lack of
	    information or resources.  This is a prime candidate for
	    somebody who is looking for a project to take on.  If the
	    problem cannot be solved at all, it will be closed, rather
	    than suspended.  The documentation project uses
	    <quote>suspended</quote> for <quote>wish-list</quote>
	    items that entail a significant amount of work which no one
	    currently has time for.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>closed</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>A problem report is closed when any changes have been
	    integrated, documented, and tested, or when fixing the
	    problem is abandoned.</para>
	</glossdef>
      </glossentry>
    </glosslist>

    <note>
      <para>The <quote>patched</quote> state is directly related to
	feedback, so you may go directly to <quote>closed</quote> state if
	the originator cannot test the patch, and it works in your own testing.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-types">
    <title>Types of Problem Reports</title>

    <para>While handling problem reports, either as a developer who has
      direct access to the GNATS database or as a contributor who
      browses the database and submits followups with patches, comments,
      suggestions or change requests, you will come across several
      different types of PRs.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-assigned">PRs already assigned to someone.</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-dups">Duplicates of existing PRs.</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-stale">Stale PRs</link></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><link linkend="pr-misfiled">Misfiled PRs</link></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following sections describe what each different type of
      PRs is used for, when a PR belongs to one of these types, and what
      treatment each different type receives.</para>

    <section id="pr-assigned">
      <title>Assigned PRs</title>

      <para>If a PR has the <literal>responsible</literal> field set
	to the username of a FreeBSD developer, it means that the PR
	has been handed over to that particular person for further
	work.</para>

      <para>Assigned PRs should not be touched by anyone but the
	assignee.  If you have comments, submit a followup.  If for
	some reason you think the PR should change state or be
	reassigned, send a message to the assignee.  If the assignee
	does not respond within two weeks, unassign the PR and do as
	you please.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="pr-dups">
      <title>Duplicate PRs</title>

      <para>If you find more than one PR that describe the same issue,
	choose the one that contains the largest amount of useful
	information and close the others, stating clearly the number
	of the superseding PR.  If several PRs contain non-overlapping
	useful information, submit all the missing information to one
	in a followup, including references to the others; then close
	the other PRs (which are now completely superseded).</para>
    </section>

    <section id="pr-stale">
      <title>Stale PRs</title>

      <para>A PR is considered stale if it has not been modified in more
	than six months.  Apply the following procedure to deal with
	stale PRs:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR contains sufficient detail, try to reproduce
	    the problem in <literal>-CURRENT</literal> and
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>.  If you succeed, submit a
	    followup detailing your findings and try to find someone
	    to assign it to.  Set the state to <quote>analyzed</quote>
	    if appropriate.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an issue which you know is the
	    result of a usage error (incorrect configuration or
	    otherwise), submit a followup explaining what the
	    originator did wrong, then close the PR with the reason
	    <quote>User error</quote> or <quote>Configuration
	    error</quote>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an error which you know has been
	    corrected in both <literal>-CURRENT</literal> and
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>, close it with a message
	    stating when it was fixed in each branch.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the PR describes an error which you know has been
	    corrected in <literal>-CURRENT</literal>, but not in
	    <literal>-STABLE</literal>, try to find out when the person
	    who corrected it is planning to MFC it, or try to find
	    someone else (maybe yourself?) to do it.  Set the state to
	    <quote>feedback</quote> and assign it to whomever will do
	    the MFC.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In other cases, ask the originator to confirm if
	    the problem still exists in newer versions.  If the
	    originator does not reply within a month, close the PR
	    with the notation <quote>Feedback timeout</quote>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section id="pr-misfiled">
      <title>Misfiled PRs</title>

      <para>GNATS is picky about the format of a submitted bug report.
	This is why a lot of PRs end up being <quote>misfiled</quote> if
	the submitter forgets to fill in a field or puts the wrong sort of
	data in some of the PR fields.  This section aims to provide most
	of the necessary details for FreeBSD developers that can help them to
	close or refile these PRs.</para>

      <para>When GNATS cannot deduce what to do with a problem report
	that reaches the database, it sets the responsible of the PR to
	<literal>gnats-admin</literal> and files it under the
	<literal>pending</literal> category.  This is now a
	<quote>misfiled</quote> PR and will not appear in bug report
	listings, unless someone explicitly asks for a list of all the
	misfiled PRs.  If you have access to the FreeBSD cluster
	machines, you can use <command>query-pr</command> to view a
	listing of PRs that have been misfiled:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>query-pr -x -q -r gnats-admin</userinput>
   52458 gnats-ad   open      serious   medium    Re: declaration clash f
   52510 gnats-ad   open      serious   medium    Re: lots of sockets in
   52557 gnats-ad   open      serious   medium
   52570 gnats-ad   open      serious   medium    Jigdo maintainer update</screen>

      <para>Commonly PRs like the ones shown above are misfiled for one
	of the following reasons:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>A followup to an existing PR, sent through email, has
	    the wrong format on its <literal>Subject:</literal>
	    header.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>When completing the &man.send-pr.1; template, the submitter
	    forgot to set the category or class of the PR to a proper
	    value.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It is not a real PR, but some random message sent to
	    <email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.org</email> or
	    <email>freebsd-gnats-submit@FreeBSD.org</email>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <section id="pr-misfiled-followups">
	<title>Followups misfiled as new PRs</title>

	<para>The first category of misfiled PRs, the one with the wrong
	  subject header, is actually the one that requires the greatest
	  amount of work from developers.  These are not real PRs,
	  describing separate problem reports.  When a reply is received
	  for an existing PR at one of the addresses that GNATS
	  <quote>listens</quote> to for incoming messages, the subject
	  of the reply should always be of the form:</para>

	<programlisting>Subject: Re: category/number: old synopsis text</programlisting>

	<para>Most mailers will add the
	  <quote><literal>Re:&nbsp;</literal></quote> part when you
	  reply to the original mail message of a PR.  The
	  <quote><literal>category/number:&nbsp;</literal></quote> part
	  is a GNATS-specific convention that you have to manually
	  insert to the subject of your followup reports.</para>

	<para>Any FreeBSD developer, who has direct access to the GNATS
	  database, can periodically check for PRs of this sort and move
	  interesting bits of the misfiled PR into the audit trail of
	  the original PR (by posting a proper followup to a bug report
	  to the address <email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.org</email>).  Then
	  the misfiled PR can be closed with a message similar
	  to:</para>

	<programlisting>Your problem report was misfiled.  Please use the format
"Subject: category/number: original text" when following
up to older, existing PRs.  I've added the relevant bits
from the body of this PR to kern/12345</programlisting>

	<para>Searching with <command>query-pr</command> for the
	  original PR, of which a misfiled followup is a reply, is as
	  easy as running:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; query-pr -q -y "some text"</screen>

	<para>After you locate the original PR and the misfiled
	  followups, use the <option>-F</option> option of
	  <command>query-pr</command> to save the full text of all the
	  relevant PRs in a &unix; mailbox file, i.e.:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>query-pr -F 52458 52474 &gt; mbox</userinput></screen>

	<para>Now you can use any mail user agent to view all the PRs
	  you saved in <filename>mbox</filename>.  Copy the text of all
	  the misfiled PRs in a followup to the original PR and make
	  sure you include the proper <literal>Subject:</literal>
	  header.  Then close the misfiled PRs.  When you close the misfiled
	  PRs remember that the submitter receives a mail notification that
	  his PR changed state to <quote>closed</quote>.  Make sure you
	  provide enough details in the log about the reason of this state
	  change.  Typically something like the following is ok:</para>

	<programlisting>Followup to ports/45364 misfiled as a new PR.
This was misfiled because the subject didn't have the format:

	Re: ports/45364: ...</programlisting>

	<para>This way the submitter of the misfiled PR will know what to
	  avoid the next time a followup to an existing PR is sent.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="pr-misfiled-format">
	<title>PRs misfiled because of missing fields</title>

	<para>The second type of misfiled PRs is usually the result of a
	  submitter forgetting to fill all the necessary fields when
	  writing the original PR.</para>

	<para>Missing or bogus <quote>category</quote> or
	  <quote>class</quote> fields can result in a misfiled report.
	  Developers can use &man.edit-pr.1; to change the category or
	  class of these misfiled PRs to a more appropriate value and
	  save the PR.</para>

	<para>Another common cause of misfiled PRs because of formatting
	  issues is quoting, changes or removal of the
	  <command>send-pr</command> template, either by the user who
	  edits the template or by mailers which do strange things to
	  plain text messages.  This doesn't happen a lot of the time,
	  but it can be fixed with <command>edit-pr</command> too; it
	  does require a bit of work from the developer who refiles the
	  PR, but it is relatively easy to do most of the time.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="pr-misfiled-notpr">
	<title>Misfiled PRs that are not really problem reports</title>

	<para>Sometimes a user wants to submit a report for a problem
	  and sends a simple email message to GNATS.  The GNATS scripts
	  will recognize bug reports that are formatted using the
	  &man.send-pr.1; template.  They cannot parse any sort of email
	  though.  This is why submissions of bug reports that are sent
	  to <email>freebsd-gnats-submit@FreeBSD.org</email> have to
	  follow the template of <command>send-pr</command>, but email
	  reports can be sent to &a.bugs;.</para>

	<para>Developers that come across PRs that look like they should have
	  been posted to &a.bugs.name; or some other list should close the
	  PR, informing the submitter in their state-change log why this
	  is not really a PR and where the message should be posted.</para>

	<para>The email addresses that GNATS listens to for incoming PRs
	  have been published as part of the FreeBSD documentation, have
	  been announced and listed on the web-site.  This means that
	  spammers found them.  Every day several messages with
	  advertisements would reach GNATS which promptly files them all
	  under the <quote>pending</quote> category until someone looks
	  at them.  Closing one of these with &man.edit-pr.1; is very
	  annoying though, because GNATS replies to the submitter and
	  the sender's address of spam mail is never valid these days.
	  Bounces will come back for each PR that is closed.</para>

	<para>Currently, with the installation of some antispam filters
	  that check all submissions to the GNATS database, the amount
	  of spam that reaches the <quote>pending</quote> state is very
	  small.</para>

	<para>All developers who have access to the FreeBSD.org cluster
	  machines are encouraged to check for misfiled PRs and immediately
	  close those that are spam mail.  Whenever you close one of
	  these PRs it is also a good idea to set its category to
	  <quote><literal>junk</literal></quote>.  Junk PRs are not
	  backed up, so filing spam mail under this category makes it
	  obvious that we do not care to keep it around or waste disk
	  space for it.</para>

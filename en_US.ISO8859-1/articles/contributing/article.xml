  <para>So you want to contribute to &os;? That is great!  &os;
    <emphasis>relies</emphasis> on the contributions of its user base
    to survive.  Your contributions are not only appreciated, they are
    vital to &os;'s continued growth.</para>

  <para>A large and growing number of international contributors, of
    greatly varying ages and areas of technical expertise, develop
    &os;.  There is always more work to be done than there are people
    available to do it, and more help is always appreciated.</para>

  <para>As a volunteer, what you do is limited only by what you want
    to do.  However, we do ask that you are aware of what other
    members of the &os; community will expect of you.  You may want
    to take this into account before deciding to volunteer.</para>

  <para>The &os; project is responsible for an entire operating
    system environment, rather than just a kernel or a few scattered
    utilities.  As such, our <filename>TODO</filename> lists span a
    very wide range of tasks: from documentation, beta testing and
    presentation, to the system installer and highly specialized types
    of kernel development.  People of any skill level, in almost any
    area, can almost certainly help the project.</para>

  <para>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are
    also encouraged to contact us.  Do you need a special extension to
    make your product work? You will find us receptive to your
    requests, given that they are not too outlandish.  Are you working
    on a value-added product? Please let us know! We may be able to
    work cooperatively on some aspect of it.  The free software world
    is challenging many existing assumptions about how software is
    developed, sold, and maintained, and we urge you to at least give
    it a second look.</para>

    <title>What Is Needed</title>

    <para>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents
      something of an amalgam of various <filename>TODO</filename>
      lists and user requests.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="non-programmer-tasks">
      <title>Ongoing Non-Programmer Tasks</title>

      <para>Many people who are involved in FreeBSD are not
	programmers.  The Project includes documentation writers, Web
	designers, and support people.  All that these people need to
	contribute is an investment of time and a willingness to
	learn.</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Read through the FAQ and Handbook periodically.  If
	    anything is poorly explained, ambiguous, out of date or
            incorrect, let us know.  Even better, send us a fix
	    (Docbook is not difficult to learn, but there is no
	    objection to ASCII submissions).</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Help translate FreeBSD documentation into your native
	    language.  If documentation already exists for your
	    language, you can help translate additional documents or
	    verify that the translations are up-to-date and correct.
	    First take a look at the <link
	      xlink:href="&url.books.fdp-primer;/translations.html">Translations
	      FAQ</link> in the FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer.
	    You are not committing yourself to translating every
	    single FreeBSD document by doing this &mdash; as a
	    volunteer, you can do as much or as little translation as
	    you desire.  Once someone begins translating, others
	    almost always join the effort.  If you only have the time
	    or energy to translate one part of the documentation,
	    please translate the installation instructions.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Read the &a.questions; occasionally (or
	    even regularly).  It can be very satisfying to share your
	    expertise and help people solve their problems; sometimes
	    you may even learn something new yourself!  These forums
	    can also be a source of ideas for things to improve upon.

      <para>The <link xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/">FreeBSD
	  PR list</link> shows all the current active problem reports
	and requests for enhancement that have been submitted by
	FreeBSD users.  The PR database includes both programmer and
	non-programmer tasks.  Look through the open PRs, and see if
	anything there takes your interest.  Some of these might be
	very simple tasks that just need an extra pair of eyes to look
	over them and confirm that the fix in the PR is a good one.
	Others might be much more complex, or might not even have a
	fix included at all.</para>

      <para>Start with the PRs that have not been assigned to anyone

	quality repository of third party software.  We need people to
	donate some of their time and effort to help us achieve this

      <para>Anyone can get involved, and there are lots of different

	Whether you are looking for an ongoing role, or a fun challenge

    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="contrib-how">
    <title>How to Contribute</title>

    <para>Contributions to the system generally fall into one or more
      of the following 5 categories:</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="contrib-general">
      <title>Bug Reports and General Commentary</title>

      <para>An idea or suggestion of <emphasis>general</emphasis>
	technical interest should be mailed to the &a.hackers;.
	Likewise, people with an interest in such things (and a
	tolerance for a <emphasis>high</emphasis> volume of mail!) may
	subscribe to the &a.hackers;.  See <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">The
	  FreeBSD Handbook</link> for more information about this and
	other mailing lists.</para>

      <para>If you find a bug or are submitting a specific change,
	please report it using the <link
	xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/submit/">bug submission form</link>.
	Try to fill-in each field of the bug
	report.  Unless they exceed 65KB, include any patches directly
	in the report.  If the patch is suitable to be applied to the
	source tree put <literal>[PATCH]</literal> in the synopsis of
	the report.  When including patches,
	<emphasis>do not</emphasis> use cut-and-paste because
	cut-and-paste turns tabs into spaces and makes them unusable.
	When patches are a lot larger than 20KB, consider compressing
	them (eg. with &man.gzip.1; or &man.bzip2.1;) prior to
	uploading them.</para>

      <para>After filing a report, you should receive confirmation
	along with a tracking number.  Keep this tracking number so
	that you can update us with details about the problem.</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para>Changes to the documentation are overseen by the &a.doc;.
	Please look at the
	<link xlink:href="&url.books.fdp-primer;/index.html">FreeBSD
	  Documentation Project Primer</link> for complete
	instructions.  Send submissions and changes (even small ones
	are welcome!) using the same method any other bug
	report.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Changes to Existing Source Code</title>

      <indexterm><primary>FreeBSD-CURRENT</primary></indexterm>

      <para>An addition or change to the existing source code is a
	somewhat trickier affair and depends a lot on how far out of
	date you are with the current state of FreeBSD development.
	There is a special on-going release of FreeBSD known as
	<quote>FreeBSD-CURRENT</quote> which is made available in a
	variety of ways for the convenience of developers working
	actively on the system.  See <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html">The FreeBSD
	  Handbook</link> for more information about getting and
	using FreeBSD-CURRENT.</para>

      <para>Working from older sources unfortunately means that your
	changes may sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for
	easy re-integration into FreeBSD.  Chances of this can be
	minimized somewhat by subscribing to the &a.announce; and the
	&a.current; lists, where discussions on the current state of
	the system take place.</para>

      <para>Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date
	sources to base your changes on, the next step is to produce a
	set of diffs to send to the FreeBSD maintainers.  This is done
	with the &man.diff.1; command.</para>

      <para>The preferred &man.diff.1; format for submitting patches
	is the unified output format generated by
	<command>diff -u</command>.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><command>diff</command></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -u oldfile newfile</userinput></screen>

      <para>or</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>diff -u -r -N olddir newdir</userinput></screen>

      <para>would generate a set of unified diffs for the given source
	file or directory hierarchy.</para>

      <para>See &man.diff.1; for more information.</para>

      <para>Once you have a set of diffs (which you may test with the
	&man.patch.1; command), you should submit them for inclusion
	with &os; as a bug report.
	<emphasis>Do not</emphasis> just send the
	diffs to the &a.hackers; or they will get lost! We greatly
	appreciate your submission (this is a volunteer project!);
	because we are busy, we may not be able to address it
	immediately, but it will remain in the PR database until we
	do.  Indicate your submission by including
	<literal>[PATCH]</literal> in the synopsis of the
	report.</para>

      <para>If you feel it appropriate (e.g. you have added, deleted,
	or renamed files), bundle your changes into a
	<command>tar</command> file.
	Archives created with &man.shar.1; are also
	welcome.</para>

      <para>If your change is of a potentially sensitive nature, such
	as if you are unsure of copyright issues governing its further
	distribution then you should send it to &a.core; directly
	rather than submitting as a bug report.  The &a.core;
	reaches a much smaller group of people who do much of the
	day-to-day work on FreeBSD.  Note that this group is also
	<emphasis>very busy</emphasis> and so you should only send
	mail to them where it is truly necessary.</para>

      <para>Please refer to &man.intro.9; and &man.style.9; for
	some information on coding style.  We would appreciate it if
	you were at least aware of this information before submitting
	code.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>New Code or Major Value-Added Packages</title>

      <para>In the case of a significant contribution of a large body
	work, or the addition of an important new feature to FreeBSD,
	it becomes almost always necessary to either send changes as
	tar files or upload them to a web or FTP site for
	other people to access.  If you do not have access to a web or
	FTP site, ask on an appropriate FreeBSD mailing list for
	someone to host the changes for you.</para>

      <para>When working with large amounts of code, the touchy
	subject of copyrights also invariably comes up.  &os;
	prefers free software licenses such as BSD or ISC.
	Copyleft licenses such as GPLv2 are sometimes permitted.  The
	complete listing can be found on the <link

      <title>Adopting an unmaintained port</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Choosing an unmaintained port</title>

	<para>Taking over maintainership of ports that are
	  unmaintained is a great way to get involved.  Unmaintained
	  ports are only updated and fixed when somebody volunteers to
	  work on them.  There are a large number of unmaintained
	  ports.  It is a good idea to start with adopting a port that
	  you use regularly.</para>

	<para>Unmaintained ports have their
	  <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> set to
	  <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>.  A list of unmaintained
	  ports and their current errors and problem reports can be seen
	  at the <link xlink:href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/portsconcordanceformaintainer.py?maintainer=ports%40FreeBSD.org">&os;
	    Ports Monitoring System</link>.</para>

	<para>Some ports affect a large number of others due to
	  dependencies and slave port relationships.  Generally, we
	  want people to have some experience before they maintain such
	  ports.</para>

	<para>You can find out whether or not a port has dependencies
	  or slave ports by looking at a master index of ports called
	  <filename>INDEX</filename>.  (The name of the file varies
	  by release of &os;; for instance,
	  <filename>INDEX-8</filename>.) Some ports have conditional
	  dependencies that are not included in a default
	  <filename>INDEX</filename> build.  We expect you to be able to
	  recognize such ports by looking through other ports'
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>s.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>How to adopt the port</title>

	<para>First make sure you understand your
	  <link linkend="maintain-port">responsibilities as a
	    maintainer</link>.  Also read the
	  <link xlink:href="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's
	    Handbook</link>.  <emphasis>Please do not commit yourself
	    to more than you feel you can comfortably
	    handle.</emphasis></para>

	<para>You may request maintainership of any unmaintained port
	  as soon as you wish.  Simply set <varname>MAINTAINER</varname>
	  to your own email address and send a PR (Problem Report) with
	  the change.  If the port has build errors or needs updating,
	  you may wish to include any other changes in the same PR.
	  This will help because many committers are less willing to
	  assign maintainership to someone who does not have a known
	  track record with &os;.  Submitting PRs that fix build errors
	  or update ports are the best ways to establish one.</para>

	<para>File your PR with category <literal>ports</literal> and
	  class <literal>change-request</literal>.  A committer will
	  examine your PR, commit the changes, and finally close the
	  PR.  Sometimes this process can take a little while
	  (committers are volunteers, too :).</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="maintain-port">
      <title>The challenge for port maintainers</title>

      <para>This section will give you an idea of why ports need to be

	maintainer.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="why-maintenance">
	<title>Why ports require maintenance</title>

	<para>Creating a port is a once-off task.  Ensuring that a
	  port is up to date and continues to build and run requires
	  an ongoing maintenance effort.  Maintainers are the people
	  who dedicate some of their time to meeting these goals.</para>

	<para>The foremost reason ports need maintenance is to bring
	  the latest and greatest in third party software to the &os;
	  community.  An additional challenge is to keep individual
	  ports working within the Ports Collection framework as it
	  evolves.</para>

	<para>As a maintainer, you will need to manage the following

	  <title>Keep your ports up to date</title>

	  <para>This section outlines the process to follow to keep your
	    ports up to date.</para>

	  <para>This is an overview.  More information about upgrading a
	    port is available in the
	    <link xlink:href="&url.books.porters-handbook;">
	      Porter's Handbook</link>.</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <title>Watch for updates</title>

	      <para>Monitor the upstream vendor for new versions,
		updates and security fixes for the software.
		Announcement mailing lists or news web pages are useful
		for doing this.  Sometimes users will contact you and
		ask when your port will be updated.  If you are busy
		with other things or for any reason just cannot update
		it at the moment, ask if they will help you by
		submitting an update.</para>

	      <para>You may also receive automated email from the
		<literal>&os; Ports Version Check</literal> informing
		you that a newer version of your port's distfile is
		available.  More information about that system
		(including how to stop future emails) will be provided
		in the message.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Incorporate changes</title>

	      <para>When they become available, incorporate the changes
		into the port.  You need to be able to generate a patch
		between the original port and your updated port.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Review and test</title>

	      <para>Thoroughly review and test your changes:</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>Build, install and test your port on as many
		    platforms and architectures as you can.  It is

		<listitem>
		  <para>Make sure your port's dependencies are complete.

		<listitem>
		  <para>Consider whether changes to your port might
		    cause any other ports to break.  If this is the
		    case, coordinate the changes with the maintainers of
		    those ports.  This is especially important if your
		    update changes the shared library version; in this
		    case, at the very least, the dependent ports will
		    need to get a <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> bump
		    so that they will automatically be upgraded by
		    automated tools such as
		    <application>portmaster</application> or
		    &man.portupgrade.1;.</para>
		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Submit changes</title>

	      <para>Send your update by submitting a PR with an
		explanation of the changes and a patch containing the
		differences between the original port and the updated
		one.  Please refer to <link xlink:href="&url.articles.problem-reports;">Writing FreeBSD
		  Problem Reports</link> for information on how to
		write a really good PR.</para>

	      <note>
		<para>Please do not submit a &man.shar.1; archive of the
		  entire port; instead, use &man.diff.1;
		  <literal>-ruN</literal>.  In this way, committers can
		  much more easily see exactly what changes are being
		  made.  The Porter's Handbook section on <link xlink:href="&url.books.porters-handbook;/port-upgrading.html">Upgrading</link>
		  has more information.</para>

	    <step>
	      <title>Wait</title>

	      <para>At some stage a committer will deal with your PR.
		It may take minutes, or it may take weeks &mdash; so
		please be patient.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Give feedback</title>

	      <para>If a committer finds a problem with your changes,
		they will most likely refer it back to you.  A prompt
		response will help get your PR committed faster, and
		is better for maintaining a thread of conversation
		when trying to resolve any problems.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>And Finally</title>

	      <para>Your changes will be committed and your port will
		have been updated.  The PR will then be closed by the

	  <title>Ensure your ports continue to build correctly</title>

	  <para>This section is about discovering and fixing problems
	    that stop your ports from building correctly.</para>

	  <para>&os; only guarantees that the Ports Collection works on
	    the <literal>-STABLE</literal> branches.
	    In
	    theory, you should be able to get by with running the latest
	    release of each stable branch (since the ABIs are not
	    supposed to change) but if you can run the branch, that is
	    even better.</para>

	  <para>Since the majority of &os; installations run on
	    PC-compatible machines (what is termed the
	    <literal>i386</literal> architecture), we expect you to keep
	    the port working on that architecture.  We prefer that ports
	    also work on the <literal>amd64</literal> architecture
	    running native.  It is completely fair to ask for help if
	    you do not have one of these machines.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>The usual failure modes for
	      non-<literal>x86</literal> machines are that the original
	      programmers assumed that, for instance, pointers are
	      <literal>int</literal>s, or that a relatively lax older
	      <application>gcc</application> compiler was being used.
	      More and more, application authors are reworking their
	      code to remove these assumptions &mdash; but if the author
	      is not actively maintaining their code, you may need to do
	      this yourself.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>These are the tasks you need to perform to ensure your
	    port is able to be built:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <title>Watch for build failures</title>

	      <para>Check your mail for mail from
		<literal>pkg-fallout@FreeBSD.org</literal> 
		and the <link xlink:href="http://portscout.FreeBSD.org">distfiles scanner</link>
		to see if any of the port which are failing to build
		are out of date.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Collect information</title>

	      <para>Once you are aware of a problem, collect information
		to help you fix it.  Build errors reported by
		<literal>pkg-fallout</literal> are accompanied by logs
		which will show you where the build failed.  If the
		failure was reported to you by a user, ask them to send
		you information which may help in diagnosing the
		problem, such as:</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>Build logs</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>The commands and options used to build the

		  <para>A list of packages installed on their system
		    as shown by &man.pkg-info.8;</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>The version of &os; they are running as
		    shown by &man.uname.1;<command> -a</command></para>

		<listitem>
		  <para>When their ports collection was last

		  <para>When their ports tree and
		  <filename>INDEX</filename> was last updated</para>
		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Investigate and find a solution</title>

	      <para>Unfortunately there is no straightforward process to
		follow to do this.  Remember, though: if you are stuck,
		ask for help!  The &a.ports; is a good place to start,
		and the upstream developers are often very
		helpful.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Submit changes</title>

	      <para>Just as with updating a port, you should now
		incorporate changes, review and test, submit your
		changes in a PR, and provide feedback if
		required.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Send patches to upstream authors</title>

	      <para>In some cases, you will have to make patches to the
		port to make it run on FreeBSD.  Some (but not all)
		upstream authors will accept such patches back into
		their code for the next release.  If so, this may even
		help their users on other BSD-based systems as well and
		perhaps save duplicated effort.  Please consider sending
		any applicable patches to the authors as a
		courtesy.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>

	  <title>Investigate bug reports and PRs related to your
	    port</title>

	  <para>This section is about discovering and fixing
	    bugs.</para>

	  <para>&os;-specific bugs are generally caused by assumptions
	    about the build and runtime environments that do not apply
	    to &os;.  You are less likely to encounter a problem of this
	    type, but it can be more subtle and difficult to
	    diagnose.</para>

	  <para>These are the tasks you need to perform to ensure your
	    port continues to work as intended:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <title>Respond to bug reports</title>

	      <para>Bugs may be reported to you through email via the
		<link xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/">
		Problem Report database</link>.  Bugs may also be
		reported directly to you by users.</para>

	      <para>You should respond to PRs and other reports within
		14 days, but please try not to take that long.  Try to
		respond as soon as possible, even if it is just to say
		you need some more time before you can work on the
		PR.</para>

	      <para>If you have not responded after 14 days, any
		committer may commit from a PR that you have not
		responded to via a
		<literal>maintainer-timeout</literal>.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Collect information</title>

	      <para>If the person reporting the bug has not also
		provided a fix, you need to collect the information that
		will allow you to generate one.</para>

	      <para>If the bug is reproducible, you can collect most of
		the required information yourself.  If not, ask the
		person who reported the bug to collect the information
		for you, such as:</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A detailed description of their actions,
		    expected program behavior and actual behavior</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>Copies of input data used to trigger the
		    bug</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>Information about their build and execution
		    environment &mdash; for example, a list of installed
		    packages and the output of &man.env.1;</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>Core dumps</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
		  <para>Stack traces</para>
		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Eliminate incorrect reports</title>

	      <para>Some bug reports may be incorrect.  For example,
		the user may have simply misused the program; or their
		installed packages may be out of date and require
		updating.  Sometimes a reported bug is not specific to
		&os;.  In this case report the bug to the upstream
		developers.  If the bug is within your capabilities to
		fix, you can also patch the port so that the fix is
		applied before the next upstream release.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Find a solution</title>

	      <para>As with build errors, you will need to sort out a
		fix to the problem.  Again, remember to ask if you are
		stuck!</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <title>Submit or approve changes</title>

	      <para>Just as with updating a port, you should now
		incorporate changes, review and test, and submit your
		changes in a PR (or send a follow-up if a PR already
		exists for the problem).  If another user has submitted
		changes in the PR, you can also send a follow-up saying
		whether or not you approve the changes.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Providing support</title>

	  <para>Part of being a maintainer is providing support &mdash;
	    not for the software in general &mdash; but for the port and
	    any &os;-specific quirks and problems.  Users may contact
	    you with questions, suggestions, problems and patches.  Most
	    of the time their correspondence will be specific to
	    &os;.</para>

	  <para>Occasionally you may have to invoke your skills in
	    diplomacy, and kindly point users seeking general support to
	    the appropriate resources.  Less frequently you will
	    encounter a person asking why the <literal>RPM</literal>s
	    are not up to date or how can they get the software to run
	    under Foo Linux.  Take the opportunity to tell them that
	    your port is up to date (if it is, of course!), and suggest
	    that they try &os;.</para>

	  <para>Sometimes users and developers will decide that you are
	    a busy person whose time is valuable and do some of the work
	    for you.  For example, they might:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>submit a PR or send you patches to update your
		port,</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>investigate and perhaps provide a fix to a PR,
		or</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>otherwise submit changes to your port.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>In these cases your main obligation is to respond in a
	    timely manner.  Again, the timeout for non-responsive
	    maintainers is 14 days.  After this period changes may be
	    committed unapproved.  They have taken the trouble to do
	    this for you; so please try to at least respond promptly.
	    Then review, approve, modify or discuss their changes with
	    them as soon as possible.</para>

	  <para>If you can make them feel that their contribution is
	    appreciated (and it should be) you will have a better chance
	    persuading them to do more things for you in the future

      <para>You can use the <link xlink:href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/search">web
	  interface</link> to the Problem Report database to search
	through and view unresolved PRs.  The majority of ports PRs are
	updates, but with a little searching and skimming over synopses
	you should be able to find something interesting to work on (the

	start).</para>

      <para>The other place is the <link xlink:href="http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/">&os; Ports Monitoring
	  System</link>.  In particular look for unmaintained ports
	with build errors and ports that are marked
	<varname>BROKEN</varname>.  It is OK to send changes for a
	maintained port as well, but remember to ask the maintainer in
	case they are already working on the problem.</para>

      <para>Once you have found a bug or problem, collect information,
	investigate and fix!  If there is an existing PR, follow up to
	that.  Otherwise create a new PR.  Your changes will be reviewed
	and, if everything checks out, committed.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="mortal-coil">
      <title>When to call it quits</title>

      <para>As your interests and commitments change, you may find that
	you no longer have time to continue some (or all) of your ports
	contributions.  That is fine!  Please let us know if you are no
	longer using a port or have otherwise lost time or interest in
	being a maintainer.  In this way we can go ahead and allow other
	people to try to work on existing problems with the port without
	waiting for your response.  Remember, &os; is a volunteer

      <para>In any case, the Ports Management Team

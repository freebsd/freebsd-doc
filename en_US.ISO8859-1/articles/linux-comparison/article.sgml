    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>&os; is a &unix; like operating system based on the
      Berkeley Software Distribution. While &os; and &linux; are
      commonly perceived as being very similar, there are differences:</para>

    <orderedlist>

      <listitem>

	<para>&linux; itself is a kernel. Distributions (e.g. Red Hat,
          Debian, Suse and others) provide the installer and the
          utilities available to the user.  http://www.linux.org/dist
          lists well over 300 distinct distributions.  While giving
          the user maximum flexibility, the existence of so many
          distributions also increases the difficulty of transferring
          one's skills from one distribution to another. Distributions
          don't just differ in ease-of install and available programs;
          they also differ in directory layout, available shells and
          window managers, and software installation and patching
          routines.</para>

        <para>&os; is a complete operating system (kernel and
	  userland) with a well-respected heritage grounded in the
	  roots of Unix development.

	  <footnote>
	    <para>See also <ulink
	      url="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html"></ulink>
	      for a brief history.</para>
	  </footnote>

	  Since both the kernel and the
	  provided utilities are under the control of the same release
	  engineering team, there is less likelihood of library
	  incompatibilities. Security vulnerabilities can also be
	  addressed quickly by the security team. When new utilities
	  or kernel features are added, the user simply needs to read
	  one file, the Release Notes, which is publicly available on
	  the main page of the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org">&os; website</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>&os; has a large and well organized programming base
          which ensures changes are implemented quickly and in a
          controlled manner. There are several thousand programmers
          who contribute code on a regular basis but only about 300 of
          these have what is known as a commit bit and can actually
          commit changes to the kernel, utilities and official
          documentation. A release engineering team provides quality
          control and a security officer team is responsible for
          responding to security incidents. In addition, there is an
          elected core group of 8 senior committers who set the
          overall direction of the Project.</para>

        <para>In contrast, changes to the Linux kernel ultimately have
          to wait until they pass through the maintainer of kernel
          source, Linus Torvalds. How changes to distributions occur
          can vary widely, depending upon the size of each particular
          distribution's programming base and organizational method.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <para>While both &os; and &linux; use an Open Source
          licensing model, the actual licenses used differ. The Linux
          kernel is under the <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GPL license</ulink> while
          &os; uses the <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD license</ulink>. These,
          and other Open Source licenses, are described in more detail
          at the website of the <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">Open Source
          Initiative</ulink>.</para>

        <para>The driving philosophy behind the GPL is to ensure that
          code remains Open Source; it does this by placing
          restrictions on the distribution of GPLd code. In contrast,
          the BSD license places no such restrictions, which gives you
          the flexibility of keeping the code Open Source or closing
          the code for a proprietary commercial product.

	  <footnote>
	    <para>For a fairly unbiased view of the merits of each
	      license, see <ulink
	      url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_and_GPL_licensing"></ulink>.</para>
	  </footnote>

          Having
          stable and reliable code under the attractive BSD license
          means that many operating systems, such as <ulink url="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/darwin/faq.html">Apple OS X</ulink>
          are based on FreeBSD code. It also means that if you choose
          to use BSD licensed code in your own projects, you can do so
          without threat of future legal liability.</para>

      <title>Supported Platforms</title>

      <para>&os; has gained a reputation as a secure, stable,
        operating system for the &intel; (&i386;) platform.  However,
        &os; also supports the following architectures:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

      <para>Up-to-date hardware lists are maintained for each
        architecture so you can tell at a glance if your hardware is
        supported. For servers, there is excellent hardware RAID and
        network interface support.</para>

      <para>&os; also makes a great workstation and laptop
        operating system! It supports the X Window System, the same
        one used in &linux; distributions to provide a desktop user
        interface. It also supports over 13,000 easy to install
        third-party applications,

	<footnote>

        including KDE, Gnome, and
        OpenOffice.</para>

      <para>Several projects are available to ease the installation of

    <sect2 id="freebsd-features-frameworks">
      <title>Extensible Frameworks</title>

      <para>&os; provides many extensible frameworks to easily
        allow you to customize the FreeBSD environment to your
        particular needs. Some of the major frameworks are:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Netgraph</term>

      <listitem><para>Netgraph is a modular networking subsystem that
        can be used to supplement the existing kernel networking
        infrastructure. Hooks are provided to allow developers to
        derive their own modules. As a result, rapid prototyping and
        production deployment of enhanced network services can be
        performed far more easily and with fewer bugs. Many existing
        operational modules ship with FreeBSD and include support for:</para>

	<itemizedlist>

	</itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>GEOM</term>

      <listitem><para>GEOM is a modular disk I/O request
	transformation framework. Since it is a pluggable storage
	layer, it permits new storage services to be quickly developed
	and cleanly integrated into the FreeBSD storage
	subsystem. Some examples where this can be useful are:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Creating RAID solutions.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Providing full-blown cryptographic protection of stored data.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Newer versions of FreeBSD provide many administrative
	  utilities to use the existing GEOM modules. For example, one
	  can create a disk mirror using &man.gmirror.8;, a stripe
	  using &man.gstripe.8;, and a shared secret device using
	  &man.gshsec.8;.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>GBDE</term>

      <listitem><para>GBDE, or GEOM Based Disk Encryption, provides
        strong cryptographic protection and can protect file systems,
        swap devices, and other uses of storage media. In addition,
        GBDE transparently encrypts entire file systems, not just
        individual files. No cleartext ever touches the hard drive's
        platter.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>MAC</term>

      <listitem><para><ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mac.html">MAC</ulink>,	
	or Mandatory Access Control, provides fine-tuned access to
	files and is meant to augment traditional operating system
	authorization provided by file permissions. Since MAC is
	implemented as a modular framework, a FreeBSD system can be
	configured for any required policy varying from HIPAA
	compliance to the needs of a military-grade system.</para>

      <para>&os; ships with modules to implement the following
	policies; however the framework allows you to develop any
	required policy:</para>

      <term>PAM</term>

      <listitem><para>Like &linux;, &os; provides support for <ulink url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/pam/">PAM</ulink>,
	Pluggable Authentication Modules. This allows an administrator
	to augment the traditional &unix; username/password
	authentication model. &os; provides modules to integrate

  <sect1 id="freebsd-security">
    <title>Security</title>

    <para>Security is very important to the <ulink
url="&url.base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/releng/">FreeBSD
Release
      Engineering Team</ulink>. This
      manifests itself in several concrete areas:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>All security incidents and fixes pass through the

	security information is available at
	<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>One of the problems associated with Open Source
        software is the sheer volume of available applications. There
        are literally tens of thousands of Open Source application projects
        each with varying levels of responsiveness to security
        incidents. &os; has met this challenge head-on with <ulink
        url="http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/">VuXML</ulink>. All software
        shipped with the FreeBSD operating system as well any software
        available in the <ulink
        url="&url.base;/ports/">Ports Collection</ulink>
        is compared to a database of known, unresolved
        vulnerabilities. An administrator can use the &man.portaudit.1;
        utility to quickly determine if any software on a &os;
        system is vulnerable, and if so, receive a description of the
        problem and an URL containing a more detailed vulnerability
        description.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>&os; also provides many mechanisms which allow an

      needs:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>The &man.jail.8; utility allows an administrator

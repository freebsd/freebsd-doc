    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a
      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <quote>not a bug</quote> or <quote>bogus PR</quote>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</para>

    <para>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, you ask, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</para>

    <para>Although the primary focus of this article is on FreeBSD
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</para>

    <para>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically, so you should read through the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treat it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-when">
    <title>When to submit a problem report</title>

    <para>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug
      in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for
      a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly <emphasis>not</emphasis> the right
      course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the
      developers.  Conversely, there are cases where it might be
      appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than
      a bug&mdash;an enhancement or a feature request, for
      instance.</para>

    <para>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not?  As a
      simple rule of thumb your problem is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
      bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <quote>How do I do X?</quote> or <quote>Where can I find
      Y?</quote>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  If you are looking
      for an answer, consider posing your question to the
      &a.questions;.</para>

    <para>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem
      report about something that is not a bug are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Requests for feature enhancements.  It is generally a
	  good idea to air these on the mailing lists before
	  submitting a problem report.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Notification of updates to externally maintained
	  software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base
	  system components such as BIND or various GNU
	  utilities).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Another thing is that if the system on which you experienced
      the bug is not fairly up-to-date, you should seriously consider
      upgrading and trying to reproduce the problem on an up-to-date
      system before submitting a problem report.  There are few things
      that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report
      about a bug she has already fixed.</para>

    <para>Finally, a bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be
      fixed.  If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce
      it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are
      none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure
      out what is wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it
      does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading
      to a bug fix are very slim, and you should consider letting the
      matter drop.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-prep">
    <title>Preparations</title>

    <para>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe your problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For FreeBSD, this means:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The FreeBSD
	  <ulink URL="../../books/faq/index.html">Frequently Asked
	    Questions</ulink> (FAQ) list.
	  The FAQ attempts to provide answers for a wide range of questions,
	  such as those concerning
	  <ulink URL="../../books/faq/hardware.html">hardware
	    compatibility</ulink>,
	  <ulink URL="../../books/faq/applications.html">user
	    applications</ulink>,
	  and <ulink URL="../../books/faq/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	    configuration</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The
	  <ulink
	    URL="../../books/handbook/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">mailing
	    lists</ulink>&mdash;if you are not subscribed, use
	  <ulink
	    URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists">the
	    searchable archives</ulink> on the FreeBSD web site.  If your
	  problem has not been discussed on the lists, you might try
	  posting a message about it and waiting a few days to see if
	  someone can spot something you have overlooked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Optionally, the entire web&mdash;use your favorite
	  search engine to locate any references to your problem.  You
	  may even get hits from archived mailing lists or newsgroups
	  you did not know of or had not thought to search
	  through.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Next, the searchable
	  <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	  FreeBSD PR database</ulink> (GNATS).  Unless your problem
	  is recent or obscure, there is a fair chance it has already
	  been reported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Finally, if you are upgrading from one version to
	  another&mdash;especially if you are upgrading to the
	  <literal>-current</literal> branch&mdash;you should
	  carefully study the contents of the
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> file on your system
	  or its latest version at
	  <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/UPDATING"></ulink>.
	  This file contains many pieces of vital information.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Next, you need to make sure your problem report goes to the
      right people.</para>

    <para>The first catch here is that if the problem is a bug in
      third-party software (a port or a package you have installed), you
      should report the bug to the original author, not to the FreeBSD
      Project.  There are two exceptions to this rule: the first is if
      the bug does not occur on other platforms, in which case the
      problem may lie in how the software was ported to FreeBSD; the
      second is if the original author has already fixed the bug and
      released a patch or a new version of his software, and the
      FreeBSD port has not been updated yet.</para>

    <para>The second catch is that FreeBSD's bug tracking system sorts
      problem reports according to the category the originator
      selected.  Therefore, if you select the wrong category when you
      submit your problem report, there is a good chance that it will
      go unnoticed for a while, until someone re-categorizes
      it.</para>

  <section id="pr-writing">
    <title>Writing the problem report</title>

    <para>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem
      report, and that it is a FreeBSD problem, it is time to write
      the actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics
      of the program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some
      tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Tips and tricks for writing a good problem report</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Do not leave the <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line empty.</emphasis>  The PRs go both onto a mailing list
	    that goes all over the world (where the <quote>Synopsis</quote> is used
	    for the <literal>Subject:</literal> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid using a weak <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line.</emphasis>  You should not assume that anyone reading
	    your PR has any context for your submission, so the more
	    you provide, the better.  For instance, what part of the
	    system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see the
	    problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of <literal>Synopsis: portupgrade is
	    broken</literal>, see how much more informative this
	    seems: <literal>Synopsis: port sysutils/portupgrade
	    coredumps on -current</literal>.  (In the case of ports,
	    it is especially helpful to have both the category and
	    portname in the <quote>Synopsis</quote> line.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you have a patch, say so.</emphasis>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  If you are including one,
	    put the string <literal>[patch]</literal> at the
	    beginning of the <quote>Synopsis</quote>.  (Although it is
	    not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention,
	    that is the one that is used.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you are a maintainer, say so.</emphasis>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, a port), you might consider adding the string
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> at the beginning of
	    your synopsis line and/or set the <quote>Class</quote> of
	    your PR to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  This way
	    any committer that handles your PR will not have to check
	    with the <filename>Makefile</filename> of the PR every
	    time the PR is viewed to make sure this is an update sent
	    by the maintainer of the port.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be specific.</emphasis>
	    The more information you supply about what problem you
	    are having, the better your chance of getting a response.
	    You should include such things as what version you are
	    running (there is a place to put that, see below);
	    which architecture you are running on;
	    whether you are running from a release CDROM, or from
	    a system maintained by &man.cvsup.1; (and, if so, how
	    recently you updated); and, if a kernel problem,
	    if you have read <literal>src/UPDATING</literal>
	    (someone is guaranteed to ask).  You do not necessarily
	    have to provide your kernel configuration, which ports
	    you have available, and a core dump (including these
	    by default only tends to fill up the database), but you
	    should be prepared to make them available, either
	    privately or publicly, if so asked.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid vague requests for features.</emphasis>
	    PRs of the form <quote>someone should really implement something
	    that does so-and-so</quote> are less likely to get results than
	    very specific requests.  Remember, the source is available
	    to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to
	    ensure it being included is to get to work!  Also consider
	    the fact that many things like this would make a better
	    topic for discussion on <literal>freebsd-questions</literal>
	    than an entry in the PR database, as discussed above.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Make sure no one else has already submitted
	    a similar PR.</emphasis> Although this has already been
	    mentioned above, it bears repeating here.  It only take a
	    minute or two to use the web-based search engine at
	    <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query"></ulink>.
	    (Of course, everyone is guilty of forgetting to do this
	    now and then.)</para> </listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid controversial requests.</emphasis>
	    If your PR addresses an area that has been controversial
	    in the past, you should probably be prepared to not only
	    offer patches, but also justification for why the patches
	    are <quote>The Right Thing To Do</quote>.  As noted above,
	    a careful search of the mailing lists using the archives
	    at <ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists"></ulink>
	    is always good preparation.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be polite.</emphasis>
	    Almost anyone who would potentially work on your PR is a
	    volunteer.  No one likes to be told that they have to do
	    something when they are already doing it for some
	    motivation other than monetary gain.  This is a good thing
	    to keep in mind at all times on Open Source
	    projects.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Before you begin</title>

      <para>Before running the &man.send-pr.1; program, make sure your
        <envar>VISUAL</envar> (or <envar>EDITOR</envar> if
        <envar>VISUAL</envar> is not set) environment variable is set
        to something sensible.</para>

      <para>You should also make sure that mail delivery works fine.
	&man.send-pr.1; uses mail messages for the submission and
	tracking of problem reports.  If you cannot post mail messages
	from the machine you're running &man.send-pr.1; on, your
	problem report will not reach the GNATS database.  For details
	on the setup of mail on FreeBSD, see the <quote>Electronic
	Mail</quote> chapter of the FreeBSD Handbook at
	<ulink URL="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html"></ulink>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Attaching patches or files</title>

      <para>The &man.send-pr.1; program has provisions for attaching
	files to a problem report.  You can attach as many files as
	you want provided that each has a unique base name (i.e. the
	name of the file proper, without the path).  Just use the
	<option>-a</option> command-line option to specify the names
	of the files you wish to attach:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -a /var/run/dmesg -a /tmp/errors</userinput></screen>

      <para>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically
	encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the
	<option>-c</option> or <option>-u</option> option to
	&man.diff.1; to create a context or unified diff (unified is
	preferred), and make
	sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files
	you modified so the developers who read your report will be
	able to apply them easily.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some
	email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely
	ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</para>

      <para>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&mdash;particularly when they fix the problem
	described in the PR&mdash;large patches and especially new code
        which may require substantial review before committing should
        be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be
        included in the PR instead of the patch.  Patches in email
        tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and
        the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested
        parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on the web
        allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire
        patch in a followup to the original PR.</para>

      <para>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Filling out the template</title>

      <para>When you run &man.send-pr.1;, you are presented with a
	template.  The template consists of a list of fields, some of
	which are pre-filled, and some of which have comments explaining
	their purpose or listing acceptable values.  Do not worry
	about the comments; they will be removed automatically if you
	do not modify them or remove them yourself.</para>

      <para>At the top of the template, below the
	<literal>SEND-PR:</literal> lines, are the email headers.  You
	do not normally need to modify these, unless you are sending
	the problem report from a machine or account that can send but
	not receive mail, in which case you will want to set the
	<literal>From:</literal> and <literal>Reply-To:</literal> to
	your real email address.  You may also want to send yourself
	(or someone else) a carbon copy of the problem report by
	adding one or more email addresses to the
	<literal>Cc:</literal> header.</para>

      <para>Next comes a series of single-line fields:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Submitter-Id:</emphasis> Do not change this.
	    The default value of <literal>current-users</literal> is
	    correct, even if you run FreeBSD-STABLE.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Originator:</emphasis> This is normally
	    prefilled with the <literal>gecos</literal> field of the
	    currently logged-in
	    user.  Please specify your real name, optionally followed
	    by your email address in angle brackets.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Organization:</emphasis> Whatever you feel
	    like.  This field is not used for anything
	    significant.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Confidential:</emphasis> This is prefilled
	    to <literal>no</literal>.   Changing it makes no sense as
	    there is no such thing as a confidential FreeBSD problem
	    report&mdash;the PR database is distributed worldwide by
	    <application>CVSup</application>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Synopsis:</emphasis> Fill this out with a
	    short and accurate description of the problem.  The
	    synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report
	    email, and is used in problem report listings and
	    summaries; problem reports with obscure synopses tend to
	    get ignored.</para>

	  <para>As noted above, if your problem report includes a patch,
	    please have the synopsis start with <literal>[patch]</literal>;
	    if you are a maintainer, you may consider adding
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> and/or set the
	    <quote>Class</quote> of your PR to
	    <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Severity:</emphasis> One of
	    <literal>non-critical</literal>,
	    <literal>serious</literal> or
	    <literal>critical</literal>.  Do not overreact; refrain
	    from labeling your problem <literal>critical</literal>
	    unless it really is (e.g. <username>root</username> exploit, easily
	    reproducible panic).  Developers tend to ignore this and
	    the next field, precisely because problem report
	    submitters tend to overrate their problems.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Priority:</emphasis> One of
	    <literal>low</literal>, <literal>medium</literal> or
	    <literal>high</literal>.  See above.</para>
	</listitem>

	  <para><emphasis>Category:</emphasis> Choose one of the

	    which the problem has been observed.  This includes the
	    operating system version, the version of the specific
	    program or file that contains the problem, and any other
	    relevant items such as system configuration, other
	    installed software that influences the problem,

	    Try to avoid speculating about the causes of the problem

	    it may mislead a developer into making incorrect

	    least a workaround (which not only helps other people with
	    the same problem work around it, but may also help a
	    developer understand the cause for the problem), but if
	    you do not have any firm ideas for either, it is better to
	    leave this field blank than to speculate.</para>

      <title>Sending off the problem report</title>

      <para>Once you are done filling out the template, have saved it,
	and exit your editor, &man.send-pr.1; will prompt you with
	<prompt>s)end, e)dit or a)bort?</prompt>.  You can then hit
	<userinput>s</userinput> to go ahead and submit the problem report,
	<userinput>e</userinput> to restart the editor and make
	further modifications, or <userinput>a</userinput> to abort.
	If you choose the latter, your problem report will remain on
	disk (&man.send-pr.1; will tell you the filename before it
	terminates), so you can edit it at your leisure, or maybe
	transfer it to a system with better net connectivity, before
	sending it with the <option>-f</option> to
	&man.send-pr.1;:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -f ~/my-problem-report</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will read the specified file, validate the contents,
	strip comments and send it off.</para>
    </section>

  <section id="pr-followup">
    <title>Follow-up</title>

    <para>Once your problem report has been filed, you will receive a
      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</para>

    <para>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, just mail it to
      <email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.org</email>, making sure that the
      tracking number is included in the subject so the bug tracking
      system will know what problem report to attach it to.</para>

    <para>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just send a follow-up (in the manner prescribed
      above) saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</para>

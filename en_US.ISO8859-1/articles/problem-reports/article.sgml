    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a
      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <quote>not a bug</quote> or <quote>bogus PR</quote>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</para>

    <para>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, you ask, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</para>

    <para>Although the primary focus of this article is on &os;
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</para>

    <para>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically, so you should read through the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treat it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-when">
    <title>When to submit a problem report</title>

    <para>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug
      in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for
      a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file
      (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> the right
      course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the
      developers.  Conversely, there are cases where it might be
      appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than
      a bug&mdash;an enhancement or a feature request, for
      instance.</para>

    <para>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not?  As a
      simple rule of thumb your problem is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
      bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <quote>How do I do X?</quote> or <quote>Where can I find
      Y?</quote>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  If you are looking
      for an answer, consider posing your question to the
      &a.questions;.</para>

    <para>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem
      report about something that is not a bug are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Requests for feature enhancements.  It is generally a
	  good idea to air these on the mailing lists before
	  submitting a problem report.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Notification of updates to externally maintained
	  software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base
	  system components such as BIND or various GNU
	  utilities).</para>

	<para>For unmaintained ports (<makevar>MAINTAINER</makevar> contains
	  <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>), such update notifications
	  might get picked up by an interested
	  committer, or you might be asked to provide a patch to update
	  the port; providing it upfront will greatly improve your chances
	  that the port will get updated in a timely manner.</para>
    
	<para>If the port is maintained, PRs announcing new upstream releases
	  are usually not very useful since they generate supplementary work
	  for the committers, and the maintainer likely knows already there is
	  a new version, they have probably worked with the developers on it,
	  they are probably testing to see there is no regression, etc.</para>
    
	<para>In either case, following the process described in <ulink
	  url="&url.books.porters-handbook;/port-upgrading.html">Porter's
	  Handbook</ulink> will yield the best results.  (You might
	  also wish to read <ulink
	  url="&url.articles.contributing-ports;/article.html">
	  Contributing to the FreeBSD Ports Collection</ulink>.)
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>A bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be
      fixed.  If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce
      it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are
      none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure
      out what is wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it
      does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading
      to a bug fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often
      these kinds of bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives
      or overheating processors &mdash; you should always try to rule
      out these causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</para>

    <para>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem
      report, you need to understand that the software that makes
      up &os; is composed of several different elements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by &os; contributors, such as the kernel, the C library,
	  and the device drivers (categorized as <literal>kern</literal>);
	  the binary utilities (<literal>bin</literal>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<literal>docs</literal>); and
	  the web pages (<literal>www</literal>).  All bugs in
	  these areas should be reported to the &os; developers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into &os; and adapted.  Examples
	  include <application>bind</application>, &man.gcc.1;, and
	  &man.sendmail.8;.  Most bugs in these areas should be reported
	  to the &os; developers; but in some cases they may need to be
	  reported to the original authors instead if the problems are
	  not &os;-specific.  Usually these bugs will fall under either
	  the <literal>bin</literal> or <literal>gnu</literal>
	  categories.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the &os; Ports Collection (category
	  <literal>ports</literal>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by &os; developers; what &os; provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, you
	  should only report a problem to the &os; developers when you
	  believe the problem is &os;-specific; otherwise, you should
	  report it to the authors of the software.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Then you should ascertain whether or not the problem is
      timely.  There are few things
      that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report
      about a bug she has already fixed.</para>

    <para>If the problem is in the base system, you should first read
      the FAQ section on
      <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION">
      &os; versions</ulink>, if you are not already familiar with
      the topic.  It is not possible for &os; to fix problems in
      anything other than certain recent branches of the base system,
      so filing a bug report about an older version will probably
      only result in a developer advising you to upgrade to a
      supported version to see if the problem still recurs.  The
      Security Officer team maintains the
      <ulink url="&url.base;/security/">list of supported
      versions</ulink>.</para>

    <para>If the problem is in a port, note that you must first
      upgrade to the latest version of the Ports Collection and see
      if the problem still applies.  Due to the rapid pace of changes
      in these applications, it is infeasible for &os; to support
      anything other than the absolute latest versions, and problems
      with older version of applications simply cannot be fixed.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-prep">
    <title>Preparations</title>

    <para>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe your problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For &os;, this means:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The &os;
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/index.html">Frequently Asked
	    Questions</ulink> (FAQ) list.
	  The FAQ attempts to provide answers for a wide range of questions,
	  such as those concerning
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/hardware.html">hardware
	    compatibility</ulink>,
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/applications.html">user
	    applications</ulink>,
	  and <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	    configuration</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The
	  <ulink
	    url="&url.books.handbook;/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">mailing
	    lists</ulink>&mdash;if you are not subscribed, use
	  <ulink
	    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists">the
	    searchable archives</ulink> on the &os; web site.  If your
	  problem has not been discussed on the lists, you might try
	  posting a message about it and waiting a few days to see if
	  someone can spot something you have overlooked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Optionally, the entire web&mdash;use your favorite
	  search engine to locate any references to your problem.  You
	  may even get hits from archived mailing lists or newsgroups
	  you did not know of or had not thought to search
	  through.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Next, the searchable
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	  &os; PR database</ulink> (GNATS).  Unless your problem
	  is recent or obscure, there is a fair chance it has already
	  been reported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Most importantly, you should attempt to see if existing
	  documentation in the source base addresses your problem.</para>

	<para>For the base &os; code, you should
	  carefully study the contents of the
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> file on your system
	  or its latest version at
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/UPDATING"></ulink>.
	  (This is vital information
	  if you are upgrading from one version to
	  another&mdash;especially if you are upgrading to the
	  &os.current; branch).</para>

	<para>However, if the problem is in something that was installed
	  as a part of the &os; Ports Collection, you should refer to
	  <filename>/usr/ports/UPDATING</filename> (for individual ports)
	  or <filename>/usr/ports/CHANGES</filename> (for changes
	  that affect the entire Ports Collection).
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/UPDATING"></ulink>
	  and
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/CHANGES"></ulink>
	  are also available via CVSweb.</para>

  <section id="pr-writing">
    <title>Writing the problem report</title>

    <para>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem
      report, and that it is a &os; problem, it is time to write
      the actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics
      of the program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some
      tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Tips and tricks for writing a good problem report</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Do not leave the <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line empty.</emphasis>  The PRs go both onto a mailing list
	    that goes all over the world (where the <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    is used
	    for the <literal>Subject:</literal> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid using a weak <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line.</emphasis>  You should not assume that anyone reading
	    your PR has any context for your submission, so the more
	    you provide, the better.  For instance, what part of the
	    system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see the
	    problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of <literal>Synopsis: portupgrade is
	    broken</literal>, see how much more informative this
	    seems: <literal>Synopsis: port ports-mgmt/portupgrade
	    coredumps on -current</literal>.  (In the case of ports,
	    it is especially helpful to have both the category and
	    portname in the <quote>Synopsis</quote> line.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you have a patch, say so.</emphasis>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  If you are including one,
	    put the string <literal>[patch]</literal> (including the brackets) at the
	    beginning of the <quote>Synopsis</quote>.  (Although it is
	    not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention,
	    that is the one that is used.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you are a maintainer, say so.</emphasis>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, a port), you might consider adding the string
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> (including the brackets) at the beginning of
	    your synopsis line, and you definitely should set the
	    <quote>Class</quote> of
	    your PR to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  This way
	    any committer that handles your PR will not have to check.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be specific.</emphasis>
	    The more information you supply about what problem you
	    are having, the better your chance of getting a response.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include the version of &os; you are running (there
		is a place to put that, see below) and on which architecture.
		You should include whether you are running from a release
		(e.g. from a CDROM or download), or from
		a system maintained by &man.cvsup.1; (and, if so, how
		recently you updated).  If you are tracking the
		&os.current; branch, that is the very first thing someone
		will ask, because fixes (especially for high-profile
		problems) tend to get committed very quickly, and
		&os.current; users are expected to keep up.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include which global options you have specified in
		your <filename>make.conf</filename>.  Note: specifying
		<literal>-O2</literal> and above to &man.gcc.1; is
		known to be buggy in many situations.  While the
		&os; developers will accept patches, they are
		generally unwilling to investigate such issues due
		to simple lack of time and volunteers, and may
		instead respond that this just is not supported.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem can be reproduced easily, include
		information that will help a developer to reproduce it
		themselves.  If a problem can be demonstrated with
		specific input then include an example of that input if
		possible, and include both the actual and the expected
		output.  If this data is large or cannot be made public,
		then do try to create a minimal file that exhibits the
		same issue and that can be included within the PR.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If this is a kernel problem, then be prepared to
		supply the following information.  (You do not
		have to include these by default, which only tends to
		fill up the database, but you should include excerpts
		that you think might be relevant):</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>your kernel configuration (including which
		    hardware devices you have installed)</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>whether or not you have debugging options enabled
		    (such as <literal>WITNESS</literal>), and if so,
		    whether the problem persists when you change the
		    sense of that option</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the full text of any backtrace, panic or other console
		    output, or entries in <filename>/var/log/messages</filename>,
		    if any were generated</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the output of <command>pciconf -l</command> and
		    relevant parts of your <command>dmesg</command> output if
		    your problem relates to a specific piece of hardware</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the fact that you have read
		    <filename>src/UPDATING</filename> and that your problem
		    is not listed there (someone is guaranteed to ask)</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>whether or not you can run any other kernel as
		    a fallback (this is to rule out hardware-related
		    issues such as failing disks and overheating CPUs,
		    which can masquerade as kernel problems)</para>
		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If this is a ports problem, then be prepared to
		supply the following information.  (You do not
		have to include these by default, which only tends to
		fill up the database, but you should include excerpts
		that you think might be relevant):</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>which ports you have installed</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>any environment variables that override the
		    defaults in <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>, such
		    as <makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar></para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the fact that you have read
		    <filename>ports/UPDATING</filename> and that your problem
		    is not listed there (someone is guaranteed to ask)</para>

	      </itemizedlist>
	    </listitem>

	  </itemizedlist>

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid vague requests for features.</emphasis>
	    PRs of the form <quote>someone should really implement something
	    that does so-and-so</quote> are less likely to get results than
	    very specific requests.  Remember, the source is available
	    to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to
	    ensure it being included is to get to work!  Also consider
	    the fact that many things like this would make a better
	    topic for discussion on <literal>freebsd-questions</literal>
	    than an entry in the PR database, as discussed above.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Make sure no one else has already submitted
	    a similar PR.</emphasis> Although this has already been
	    mentioned above, it bears repeating here.  It only take a
	    minute or two to use the web-based search engine at
	    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query"></ulink>.
	    (Of course, everyone is guilty of forgetting to do this
	    now and then.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Report only one issue per Problem
	    Report.</emphasis> Avoid including two or more problems
	    within the same report unless they are related.  When
	    submitting patches, avoid adding multiple features or
	    fixing multiple bugs in the same PR unless they are closely
	    related&mdash;such PRs often take longer to resolve.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid controversial requests.</emphasis>
	    If your PR addresses an area that has been controversial
	    in the past, you should probably be prepared to not only
	    offer patches, but also justification for why the patches
	    are <quote>The Right Thing To Do</quote>.  As noted above,
	    a careful search of the mailing lists using the archives
	    at <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists"></ulink>
	    is always good preparation.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be polite.</emphasis>
	    Almost anyone who would potentially work on your PR is a
	    volunteer.  No one likes to be told that they have to do
	    something when they are already doing it for some
	    motivation other than monetary gain.  This is a good thing
	    to keep in mind at all times on Open Source
	    projects.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Before you begin</title>

      <para>If you are using the &man.send-pr.1; program, make sure your
	<envar>VISUAL</envar> (or <envar>EDITOR</envar> if
	<envar>VISUAL</envar> is not set) environment variable is set
	to something sensible.</para>

      <para>You should also make sure that mail delivery works fine.
	&man.send-pr.1; uses mail messages for the submission and
	tracking of problem reports.  If you cannot post mail messages
	from the machine you are running &man.send-pr.1; on, your
	problem report will not reach the GNATS database.  For details
	on the setup of mail on &os;, see the <quote>Electronic
	Mail</quote> chapter of the &os; Handbook at
	<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html"></ulink>.</para>

      <para>Make sure that your mailer will not mangle the message on
	its way to GNATS.  In particular, if your mailer automatically
	breaks lines, changes tabs to spaces, or escapes newline
	characters, any patch that you submit will be rendered
	unusable.  For the text sections, however, we request that
	you insert manual linebreaks somewhere around 70 characters,
	so that the web display of the PR will be readable.</para>

      <para>Similar considerations apply if you are using the
	<ulink url="&url.base;/send-pr.html"> web-based
	PR submission form</ulink> instead of &man.send-pr.1;.  Note that
	cut-and-paste operations can have their own side-effects on
	text formatting.  In certain cases it may be necessary to use
	&man.uuencode.1; to ensure that patches arrive unmodified.</para>

      <para>Finally, if your submission will be lengthy, you should
	to prepare your work offline so that nothing will be lost in
	case there is a problem submitting it.  This can especially be a
	problem with the <ulink url="&url.base;/send-pr.html">web form</ulink>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Attaching patches or files</title>

      <para>The following applies to submitting PRs via email:</para>

      <para>The &man.send-pr.1; program has provisions for attaching
	files to a problem report.  You can attach as many files as
	you want provided that each has a unique base name (i.e. the
	name of the file proper, without the path).  Just use the
	<option>-a</option> command-line option to specify the names
	of the files you wish to attach:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -a /var/run/dmesg -a /tmp/errors</userinput></screen>

      <para>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically
	encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the
	<option>-c</option> or <option>-u</option> option to
	&man.diff.1; to create a context or unified diff (unified is
	preferred), and make
	sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files
	you modified so the developers who read your report will be
	able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or the
	base utilities, a patch against &os.current; (the HEAD
	CVS branch) is preferred since all new code should be applied
	and tested there first.  After appropriate or substantial testing
	has been done, the code will be merged/migrated to the &os.stable;
	branch.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some
	email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely
	ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</para>

      <para>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<command>Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</command>.
	These will perform character escaping and the entire patch
	will be useless.</para>

      <para>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&mdash;particularly when they fix the problem
	described in the PR&mdash;large patches and especially new code
	which may require substantial review before committing should
	be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be
	included in the PR instead of the patch.  Patches in email
	tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and
	the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested
	parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on the web
	allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire
	patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since
	closed PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and
	simply marked as <literal>closed</literal>.</para>

      <para>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</para>

      <title>Filling out the template</title>

      <para>The next section applies to the email method only:</para>

      <para>When you run &man.send-pr.1;, you are presented with a
	template.  The template consists of a list of fields, some of
	which are pre-filled, and some of which have comments explaining
	their purpose or listing acceptable values.  Do not worry
	about the comments; they will be removed automatically if you
	do not modify them or remove them yourself.</para>

      <para>At the top of the template, below the
	<literal>SEND-PR:</literal> lines, are the email headers.  You
	do not normally need to modify these, unless you are sending
	the problem report from a machine or account that can send but
	not receive mail, in which case you will want to set the
	<literal>From:</literal> and <literal>Reply-To:</literal> to
	your real email address.  You may also want to send yourself
	(or someone else) a carbon copy of the problem report by
	adding one or more email addresses to the
	<literal>Cc:</literal> header.</para>

      <para>In the email template only, you will find the following
	single-line fields:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Submitter-Id:</emphasis> Do not change this.
	    The default value of <literal>current-users</literal> is

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Confidential:</emphasis> This is prefilled
	    to <literal>no</literal>.   Changing it makes no sense as

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Severity:</emphasis> One of
	    <literal>non-critical</literal>,
	    <literal>serious</literal> or
	    <literal>critical</literal>.  Do not overreact; refrain
	    from labeling your problem <literal>critical</literal>
	    unless it really is (e.g., data corruption issues, serious
	    regression from previous functionality in -CURRENT)
	    or <literal>serious</literal> unless
	    it is something that will affect many users (kernel
	    panics or freezes; problems with
	    particular device drivers or system utilities).  &os;
	    developers will not necessarily work on your problem faster
	    if you inflate its importance since there are so many other
	    people who have done exactly that &mdash; in fact, some
	    developers pay little attention to this field
	    because of this.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Security problems should <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	      be filed in GNATS, because all GNATS information is public

      <para>The next section describes fields that are common to both
	the email interface and the <ulink url="&url.base;/send-pr.html">web interface</ulink>:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Originator:</emphasis>
	    Please specify your real name, optionally followed
	    by your email address in angle brackets.
	    In the email interface, this is normally

	    currently logged-in
	    user.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>The email address you use will become public information
	      and may become available to spammers.  You should either
	      have spam handling procedures in place, or use a temporary

	      use a valid email account at all, we will not be able to
	      ask you questions about your PR.</para>
	  </note>

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Organization:</emphasis> Whatever you feel
	    like.  This field is not used for anything
	    significant.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Synopsis:</emphasis> Fill this out with a
	    short and accurate description of the problem.  The
	    synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report
	    email, and is used in problem report listings and
	    summaries; problem reports with obscure synopses tend to
	    get ignored.</para>

	  <para>As noted above, if your problem report includes a patch,
	    please have the synopsis start with <literal>[patch]</literal> (including the brackets);
	    if this is a ports PR and you are the
	    maintainer, you may consider adding
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> (including the brackets) and set the
	    <quote>Class</quote> of your PR to
	    <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Category:</emphasis> Choose an appropriate
	    category.</para>

	  <para>The first thing you need to do is to decide what part of
	    the system your problem lies in.   Remember, &os; is a
	    complete operating system, which installs both a kernel, the
	    standard libraries, many peripheral drivers, and a large number
	    of utilities (the <quote>base system</quote>).
	    However, there are thousands of additional applications in the
	    Ports Collection.  You'll first need to decide if the problem
	    is in the base system or something installed via the Ports
	    Collection.</para>

	  <para>Here is a description of the major categories:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If a problem is with the kernel, the libraries (such
		as standard C library <literal>libc</literal>), or a
		peripheral driver in the base system, in general you will
		use the <literal>kern</literal> category.  (There are a few
		exceptions; see below).  In general these are things that are
		described in section 2, 3, or 4 of the manual pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If a problem is with a binary program such as
		&man.sh.1; or &man.mount.8;, you will first need to determine
		whether these programs are in the base system or were added
		via the Ports Collection.  If you are unsure, you can do
		<command>whereis <replaceable>programname</replaceable></command>.
		&os;'s convention for the Ports Collection is to install
		everything underneath
		<filename class="directory">/usr/local</filename>,
		although this can be overridden by a system administrator.
		For these, you will use the <literal>ports</literal>
		category (yes, even if the port's category is
		<literal>www</literal>; see below).  If the location is
		<filename class="directory">/bin</filename>,
		<filename class="directory">/usr/bin</filename>,
		<filename class="directory">/sbin</filename>, or
		<filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename>,
		it is part of the base system, and you should use the
		<literal>bin</literal> category.  (A few programs, such as
		&man.gcc.1;, actually use the <literal>gnu</literal> category,
		but do not worry about that for now.)  These are all things
		that are described in section 1 or 8 of the manual pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you believe that the error is in the startup
		<literal>(rc)</literal> scripts, or in some kind of other
		non-executable configuration file, then the right category is
		<literal>conf</literal> (configuration).  These are things
		that are described in section 5 of the manual pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you have found a problem in the documentation set
		(articles, books, man pages), the correct choice is
		<literal>docs</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you are having a problem with the
		<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD web pages</ulink>,
		the proper choice is <literal>www</literal>.</para>

	      <note>
		<para>if you are having a problem with something from a
		  port named
		  <literal>www/<replaceable>someportname</replaceable></literal>,
		  this nevertheless goes in the <literal>ports</literal>
		  category.</para>
	      </note>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>There are a few more specialized categories.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be filed in
		<literal>kern</literal> but has to do with the USB subsystem,
		the correct choice is <literal>usb</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be filed in
		<literal>kern</literal> but has to do with the threading
		libraries, the correct choice is
		<literal>threads</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be in the base system,
		but has to do with our adherence to standards such as
		&posix;, the correct choice is
		<literal>standards</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem has to do with errors internal to a
		&java.virtual.machine; (&jvm;), even though &java; was
		installed from the Ports Collection, you should select the
		<literal>java</literal> category.  More general problems with
		&java; ports still go under <literal>ports</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>This leaves everything else.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you are convinced that the problem will only occur
		under the processor architecture you are using, select
		one of the architecture-specific categories: commonly
		<literal>i386</literal> for Intel-compatible machines in
		32-bit mode; <literal>amd64</literal> for AMD machines
		running in 64-bit mode (this also includes Intel-compatible
		machines running in EMT64 mode); and less commonly
		<literal>arm</literal>, <literal>ia64</literal>,
		<literal>powerpc</literal>, and <literal>sparc64</literal>.
		</para>

	      <note>
		<para>These categories are quite often misused for
		<quote>I do not know</quote> problems.  Rather than
		guessing, please just use <literal>misc</literal>.</para>
	      </note>

	      <example>
		<title>Correct use of arch-specific category</title>

		<para>You have a common PC-based machine, and think
		  you have encountered a problem specific to a particular
		  chipset or a particular motherboard: <literal>i386</literal>
		  is the right category.</para>
	      </example>

	      <example>
		<title>Incorrect use of arch-specific category</title>

		<para>You are having a problem with an add-in
		  peripheral card on a commonly seen bus, or a problem with
		  a particular type of hard disk drive: in this case, it
		  probably applies to more than one architecture, and
		  <literal>kern</literal> is the right category.</para>
	      </example>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you really do not know where the problem lies (or
		the explanation does not seem to fit into the ones above),
		use the <literal>misc</literal> category.  Before you do so,
		you may wish to ask for help on the &a.questions; first.
		You may be advised that one of the existing categories
		really is a better choice.</para>

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Description:</emphasis> A complete and

	    Try to avoid speculating about the causes of the problem

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Fix:</emphasis> Preferably a patch, or at
	    least a workaround (which not only helps other people with
	    the same problem work around it, but may also help a
	    developer understand the cause for the problem), but if
	    you do not have any firm ideas for either, it is better to

    <section>
      <title>Sending off the problem report</title>

      <para>If you are using &man.send-pr.1;:</para>

      <para>Once you are done filling out the template, have saved it,
	and exit your editor, &man.send-pr.1; will prompt you with
	<prompt>s)end, e)dit or a)bort?</prompt>.  You can then hit
	<userinput>s</userinput> to go ahead and submit the problem report,
	<userinput>e</userinput> to restart the editor and make
	further modifications, or <userinput>a</userinput> to abort.
	If you choose the latter, your problem report will remain on
	disk (&man.send-pr.1; will tell you the filename before it
	terminates), so you can edit it at your leisure, or maybe
	transfer it to a system with better net connectivity, before
	sending it with the <option>-f</option> to
	&man.send-pr.1;:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -f ~/my-problem-report</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will read the specified file, validate the contents,
	strip comments and send it off.</para>

      <para>If you are using the <ulink url="&url.base;/send-pr.html">web form</ulink>:</para>

      <para>Before you hit <literal>submit</literal>, you will need to
	fill in a field containing text that is represented in image
	form on the page.  This unfortunate measure has had to be
	adopted due to misuse by automated systems and a few misguided
	individuals.  It is a necessary evil that no one likes; please
	do not ask us to remove it.</para>

      <para>Note that you are <literal>strongly advised</literal> to
	save your work somewhere before hitting <literal>submit</literal>.
	A common problem for users is to have their web browser displaying
	a stale image from its cache.  If this happens to you, your
	submission will be rejected and you may lose your work.</para>

      <para>If you are unable to view images for any reason, and are also
	unable to use &man.send-pr.1;, please accept our apologies for

  <section id="pr-followup">
    <title>Follow-up</title>

    <para>Once your problem report has been filed, you will receive a
      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</para>

    <para>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, please use one of two methods to submit your
      followup:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The easiest way is to use the followup link on
	  the individual PR's web page, which you can reach from the
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	  PR search page</ulink>.  Clicking on this link will bring up an
	  an email window with the correct To: and Subject: lines filled in
	  (if your browser is configured to do this).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Alternatively, you can just mail it to
	  &a.bugfollowup;, making sure that the
	  tracking number is included in the subject so the bug tracking
	  system will know what problem report to attach it to.</para>

	  <para>If you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include the tracking
	    number, GNATS will become confused and create an entirely
	    new PR which it then assigns to the GNATS administrator,
	    and then your followup will become lost until someone
	    comes in to clean up the mess, which could be days or
	    weeks afterwards.</para>

    <para>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just send a follow-up (in the manner prescribed
      above) saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</para>

    <para>Most PRs go through the system and are accepted quickly;
      however, at times GNATS runs behind and you may not get your
      email confirmation for 10 minutes or even longer.  Please try to
      be patient.</para>

    <para>In addition, because GNATS receives all its input via email,
      it is absolutely vital that &os; runs all its submissions through
      spam filters.  If you do not get a response within an hour or
      two, you may have fallen afoul of them; if so, please contact
      the GNATS administrators at <email>bugmeister@FreeBSD.org</email>
      and ask for help.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Among the anti-spam measures is one that weighs against
	many common abuses seen in HTML-based email (although not necessarily
	the mere inclusion of HTML in a PR).  We strongly recommend
	against the use of HTML-based email when sending PRs: not
	only is it more likely to fall afoul of the filters, it also
	tends to merely clutter up the database.  Plain old email is
	strongly preferred.</para>
    </note>

    <para>On rare occasions you will encounter a GNATS bug where a
      PR is accepted and assigned a tracking number but it does not
      show up on the list of PRs on any of the web query pages.  What
      may have happened is that the database index has gotten out of
      synchronization with the database itself.  The way that you
      can test whether this has happened is to pull up the
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi">
      view a single PR</ulink> page and see whether the PR shows up.
      If it does, please notify the GNATS administrators at
      <email>bugmeister@FreeBSD.org</email>.  Note that there is a
      <literal>cron</literal> job that periodically rebuilds the database,
      so unless you are in a hurry, no action needs to be taken.</para>

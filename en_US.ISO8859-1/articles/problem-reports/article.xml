    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a
      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <quote>not a bug</quote> or <quote>bogus PR</quote>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</para>

    <para>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, one asks, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</para>

    <para>Although the primary focus of this article is on &os;
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</para>

    <para>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically.  Read the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treating it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pr-when">
    <title>When to Submit a Problem Report</title>

    <para>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when what seems to be a bug in a program is,
      in fact, a misunderstanding of the syntax for a command or a
      typographical error in a configuration file (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> the right course of action, and will
      only serve to frustrate both the submitter and the developers.
      Conversely, there are cases where it might be appropriate to
      submit a problem report about something else than a bug&mdash;an
      enhancement or a new feature, for instance.</para>

    <para>So how does one determine what is a bug and what is not?  As
      a simple rule of thumb, the problem is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      a bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <quote>How do I do X?</quote> or <quote>Where can I find
      Y?</quote>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  When looking
      for an answer, consider posing the question to the
      &a.questions;.</para>

    <para>Consider these factors when submitting PRs about ports or
      other software that is not part of &os; itself:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Please do not submit problem reports that simply state
	  that a newer version of an application is available.  Ports
	  maintainers are automatically notified by
	  <application>portscout</application> when a new version of
	  an application becomes available.  Actual patches to update
	  a port to the latest version are welcome.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>For unmaintained ports (<varname>MAINTAINER</varname>
	  is <literal>ports@FreeBSD.org</literal>),
	  a PR without an included patch is unlikely to get picked up
	  by a committer.  To become the maintainer of an
	  unmaintained port, submit a PR with the request (patch
	  preferred but not required).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>In either case, following the process described in <link
	    xlink:href="&url.books.porters-handbook;/port-upgrading.html">Porter's
	    Handbook</link> will yield the best results.  (You might
	  also wish to read <link
	    xlink:href="&url.articles.contributing;/ports-contributing.html">Contributing
	    to the FreeBSD Ports Collection</link>.)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>A bug that cannot be reproduced can rarely be fixed.  If the
      bug only occurred once and you cannot reproduce it, and it does
      not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are none of the
      developers will be able to reproduce it or figure out what is
      wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it does mean
      that the chances of your problem report ever leading to a bug
      fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often these kinds of
      bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives or overheating
      processors &mdash; you should always try to rule out these
      causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</para>

    <para>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem report,
      you need to understand that the software that makes up &os; is
      composed of several different elements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by &os; contributors, such as the kernel, the C library, and
	  the device drivers (categorized as <literal>kern</literal>);
	  the binary utilities (<literal>bin</literal>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<literal>docs</literal>); and the
	  web pages (<literal>www</literal>).  All bugs in these areas
	  should be reported to the &os; developers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into &os; and adapted.  Examples
	  include &man.clang.1;, and
	  &man.sendmail.8;.  Most bugs in these areas should be
	  reported to the &os; developers; but in some cases they may
	  need to be reported to the original authors instead if the
	  problems are not &os;-specific.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the &os; Ports Collection (category
	  <literal>ports</literal>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by &os; developers; what &os; provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, only
	  report a problem to the &os; developers when the problem is
	  believed to be &os;-specific; otherwise, report it to the
	  authors of the software.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Then, ascertain whether the problem is timely.  There are
      few things that will annoy a developer more than receiving a
      problem report about a bug she has already fixed.</para>

    <para>If the problem is in the base system, first read the FAQ
      section on <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION">&os;
	versions</link>, if you are not already familiar with the
      topic.  It is not possible for &os; to fix problems in anything
      other than certain recent branches of the base system, so filing
      a bug report about an older version will probably only result in
      a developer advising you to upgrade to a supported version to
      see if the problem still recurs.  The Security Officer team
      maintains the
      <link xlink:href="&url.base;/security/">list of supported
	versions</link>.</para>

    <para>If the problem is in a port, consider filing a bug with the
      upstream.  The &os; Project can not fix all bugs in all
      software.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pr-prep">
    <title>Preparations</title>

    <para>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe the problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For &os;, this means:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The &os; <link
	    xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/index.html">Frequently Asked
	    Questions</link> (FAQ) list.
	  The FAQ attempts to provide answers for a wide range of
	  questions, such as those concerning
	  <link xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/hardware.html">hardware
	    compatibility</link>,
	  <link xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/applications.html">user
	    applications</link>, and
	  <link xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	    configuration</link>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The <link
	    xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">mailing
	    lists</link>&mdash;if you are not subscribed, use <link
	    xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists">the
	    searchable archives</link> on the &os; web site.  If the
	  problem has not been discussed on the lists, you might try
	  posting a message about it and waiting a few days to see if
	  someone can spot something that has been overlooked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Optionally, the entire web&mdash;use your favorite
	  search engine to locate any references to the problem.  You
	  may even get hits from archived mailing lists or newsgroups
	  you did not know of or had not thought to search
	  through.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Next, the searchable <link
	    xlink:href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi">&os;
	    PR database</link> (Bugzilla).  Unless the problem is
	  recent or obscure, there is a fair chance it has already
	  been reported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Most importantly, attempt to see if existing
	  documentation in the source base addresses your
	  problem.</para>

	<para>For the base &os; code, you should carefully study the
	  contents of <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> on your
	  system or the latest version at <uri
	    xlink:href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/UPDATING?view=log">https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/UPDATING?view=log</uri>.
	  (This is vital information if you are upgrading from one
	  version to another&mdash;especially if you are upgrading to
	  the &os.current; branch).</para>

	<para>However, if the problem is in something that was
	  installed as a part of the &os; Ports Collection, you should
	  refer to <filename>/usr/ports/UPDATING</filename> (for
	  individual ports) or <filename>/usr/ports/CHANGES</filename>
	  (for changes that affect the entire Ports Collection).  <uri
	    xlink:href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/UPDATING?view=log">https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/UPDATING?view=log</uri>
	  and <uri
	    xlink:href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/CHANGES?view=log">https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/CHANGES?view=log</uri>
	  are also available via svnweb.</para>

  <section xml:id="pr-writing">
    <title>Writing the Problem Report</title>

    <para>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem
      report, and that it is a &os; problem, it is time to write the
      actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics of the
      program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some tips and
      tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</para>

    <section xml:id="pr-writing-tips">
      <title>Tips and Tricks for Writing a Good Problem Report</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Do not leave the <quote>Summary</quote>
	      line empty.</emphasis> The PRs go both onto a mailing
	    list that goes all over the world (where the
	    <quote>Summary</quote> is used for the
	    <literal>Subject:</literal> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid using a weak <quote>Summary</quote>
	      line.</emphasis>  You should not assume that anyone
	    reading your PR has any context for your submission, so
	    the more you provide, the better.  For instance, what part
	    of the system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see
	    the problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of
	    <literal>Summary: portupgrade is broken</literal>, see
	    how much more informative this seems:
	    <literal>Summary: port ports-mgmt/portupgrade coredumps
	      on -current</literal>.  (In the case of ports, it is
	    especially helpful to have both the category and portname
	    in the <quote>Summary</quote> line.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you have a patch, say so.</emphasis>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  Please set the
	    <literal>patch</literal> Keyword in Bugzilla.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you are a maintainer, say so.</emphasis>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, an existing port), you
	    definitely should set the <quote>Class</quote> of your PR
	    to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  This way any
	    committer that handles your PR will not have to
	    check.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be specific.</emphasis> The more information
	    you supply about what problem you are having, the better
	    your chance of getting a response.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include the version of &os; you are running (there
		is a place to put that, see below) and on which

		running from a release (e.g., from a
		<acronym>CD-ROM</acronym> or download), or from a
		system maintained by Subversion (and, if so, what
		revision number you are at).  If you are tracking the
		&os.current; branch, that is the very first thing
		someone will ask, because fixes (especially for
		high-profile problems) tend to get committed very
		quickly, and &os.current; users are expected to keep
		up.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include which global options you have specified in
		your <filename>make.conf</filename>,
		<filename>src.conf</filename>,
		and <filename>src-env.conf</filename>.
		Given the infinite number of options, not every
		combination may be fully supported.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem can be reproduced easily, include
		information that will help a developer to reproduce it
		themselves.  If a problem can be demonstrated with
		specific input then include an example of that input
		if possible, and include both the actual and the
		expected output.  If this data is large or cannot be
		made public, then do try to create a minimal file that
		exhibits the same issue and that can be included
		within the PR.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If this is a kernel problem, then be prepared to
		supply the following information.  (You do not have to
		include these by default, which only tends to fill up
		the database, but you should include excerpts that you

	      <itemizedlist>

	    <quote>someone should really implement something that does
	      so-and-so</quote> are less likely to get results than
	    very specific requests.  Remember, the source is available
	    to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to
	    ensure it being included is to get to work!  Also consider
	    the fact that many things like this would make a better
	    topic for discussion on
	    <literal>freebsd-questions</literal> than an entry in the
	    PR database, as discussed above.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Make sure no one else has already submitted

	<listitem>

	    If your PR addresses an area that has been controversial

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be polite.</emphasis> Almost anyone who

	    likes to be told that they have to do something when they
	    are already doing it for some motivation other than
	    monetary gain.  This is a good thing to keep in mind at

      <para>Similar considerations apply to use of the
	<link
	  xlink:href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi">web-based
	PR submission form</link>.  Be careful of cut-and-paste
	operations that might change whitespace or other text
	formatting.</para>

      <para>Finally, if the submission is lengthy, prepare the work
	offline so that nothing will be lost if there is a problem
	submitting it.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="pr-writing-attaching-patches">
      <title>Attaching Patches or Files</title>

      <para>When attaching a patch, be sure to use
	either <command>svn diff</command> or
	&man.diff.1; with the <option>-u</option> option
	to create a unified diff
	and make sure to specify the SVN revision number of the
	repository against which you modified files,
	so the developers who read your report will
	be able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or
	the base utilities, a patch against &os.current; (the HEAD
	Subversion branch) is preferred since all new code should be
	applied and tested there first.  After appropriate or
	substantial testing has been done, the code will be
	merged/migrated to the &os.stable; branch.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of
	some email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will
	completely ruin anything intended to be part of a
	Makefile.</para>

      <para>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<command>Content-Transfer-Encoding:
	  quoted-printable</command>.  These will perform character
	escaping and the entire patch will be useless.</para>

      <para>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&mdash;particularly when they fix the
	problem described in the PR&mdash;large patches and especially
	new code which may require substantial review before
	committing should be placed on a web or ftp server, and the
	URL should be included in the PR instead of the patch.
	Patches in email tend to get mangled,
	and the larger the patch, the harder it will be for
	interested parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on
	the web allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the
	entire patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since closed
	PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and simply
	marked as complete.</para>

      <para>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</para>

      <para>When you file a bug, you will find the following
	fields:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Summary:</emphasis> Fill this out with a
	    short and accurate description of the problem.  The
	    synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report
	    email, and is used in problem report listings and
	    summaries; problem reports with obscure synopses tend to
	    get ignored.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Severity:</emphasis> One of
	    <literal>Affects only me</literal>,
	    <literal>Affects some people</literal> or <literal>Affects
	      many people</literal>.
	    Do not overreact; refrain from labeling your problem
	    <literal>Affects many people</literal> unless it really
	    does.  &os; developers will not
	    necessarily work on your problem faster if you inflate its
	    importance since there are so many other people who have
	    done exactly that.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Category:</emphasis> Choose an appropriate
	    category.</para>

	  <para>The first thing you need to do is to decide what part
	    of the system your problem lies in.  Remember, &os; is a
	    complete operating system, which installs both a kernel,
	    the standard libraries, many peripheral drivers, and a
	    large number of utilities (the
	    <quote>base system</quote>).  However, there are thousands
	    of additional applications in the Ports Collection.
	    You'll first need to decide if the problem is in the base
	    system or something installed via the Ports
	    Collection.</para>

	  <para>Here is a description of the major categories:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If a problem is with the kernel, the libraries
		(such as standard C library <literal>libc</literal>),
		or a peripheral driver in the base system, in general
		you will use the <literal>kern</literal> category.
		(There are a few exceptions; see below).  In general
		these are things that are described in section 2, 3,
		or 4 of the manual pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If a problem is with a binary program such as
		&man.sh.1; or &man.mount.8;, you will first need to
		determine whether these programs are in the base
		system or were added via the Ports Collection.  If you
		are unsure, you can do <command>whereis
		  <replaceable>programname</replaceable></command>.
		&os;'s convention for the Ports Collection is to
		install everything underneath
		<filename class="directory">/usr/local</filename>,
		although this can be overridden by a system
		administrator.  For these, you will use the
		<literal>ports</literal> category (yes, even if the
		port's category is <literal>www</literal>; see below).
		If the location is
		<filename class="directory">/bin</filename>,
		<filename class="directory">/usr/bin</filename>,
		<filename class="directory">/sbin</filename>, or
		<filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename>, it
		is part of the base system, and you should use the
		<literal>bin</literal> category.  These are all things
		that are described in section 1 or 8 of the manual
		pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you believe that the error is in the startup
		<literal>(rc)</literal> scripts, or in some kind of
		other non-executable configuration file, then the
		right category is <literal>conf</literal>
		(configuration).  These are things that are described
		in section 5 of the manual pages.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you have found a problem in the documentation
		set (articles, books, man pages) or website the
		correct choice is <literal>docs</literal>.</para>

	      <note>
		<para>if you are having a problem with something from
		  a port named
		  <literal>www/<replaceable>someportname</replaceable></literal>,
		  this nevertheless goes in the
		  <literal>ports</literal> category.</para>
	      </note>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>There are a few more specialized categories.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be filed in
		<literal>kern</literal> but has to do with the USB
		subsystem, the correct choice is
		<literal>usb</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be filed in
		<literal>kern</literal> but has to do with the
		threading libraries, the correct choice is
		<literal>threads</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem would otherwise be in the base
		system, but has to do with our adherence to standards
		such as &posix;, the correct choice is
		<literal>standards</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you are convinced that the problem will only
		occur under the processor architecture you are using,
		select one of the architecture-specific categories:
		commonly <literal>i386</literal> for Intel-compatible
		machines in 32-bit mode; <literal>amd64</literal> for
		AMD machines running in 64-bit mode (this also
		includes Intel-compatible machines running in EMT64
		mode); and less commonly <literal>arm</literal> or
		<literal>powerpc</literal>.</para>

	      <note>
		<para>These categories are quite often misused for
		  <quote>I do not know</quote> problems.  Rather than
		  guessing, please just use
		  <literal>misc</literal>.</para>
	      </note>

	      <example>
		<title>Correct Use of Arch-Specific Category</title>

		<para>You have a common PC-based machine, and think
		  you have encountered a problem specific to a
		  particular chipset or a particular motherboard:
		  <literal>i386</literal> is the right
		  category.</para>
	      </example>

	      <example>
		<title>Incorrect Use of Arch-Specific Category</title>

		<para>You are having a problem with an add-in
		  peripheral card on a commonly seen bus, or a problem
		  with a particular type of hard disk drive: in this
		  case, it probably applies to more than one
		  architecture, and <literal>kern</literal> is the
		  right category.</para>
	      </example>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If you really do not know where the problem lies
		(or the explanation does not seem to fit into the ones
		above), use the <literal>misc</literal> category.
		Before you do so, you may wish to ask for help on the
		&a.questions; first.  You may be advised that one of
		the existing categories really is a better
		choice.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Environment:</emphasis>  This should
	    describe, as accurately as possible, the environment in
	    which the problem has been observed.  This includes the
	    operating system version, the version of the specific
	    program or file that contains the problem, and any other
	    relevant items such as system configuration, other
	    installed software that influences the problem,
	    etc.&mdash;quite simply everything a developer needs to
	    know to reconstruct the environment in which the problem
	    occurs.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Description:</emphasis>A complete and
	    accurate description of the problem you are experiencing.
	    Try to avoid speculating about the causes of the problem
	    unless you are certain that you are on the right track, as
	    it may mislead a developer into making incorrect
	    assumptions about the problem.  It should include the
	    actions you need to take to reproduce the problem.  If you
	    know any workaround, include it.  It not only helps other
	    people with
	    the same problem work around it, but may also help a
	    developer understand the cause for the problem.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pr-followup">
    <title>Follow-up</title>

    <para>Once the problem report has been filed, you will receive a
      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</para>

    <para>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, please submit a follow up.  The number one
      reason for a bug not getting fixed is lack of communication with
      the originator.  The easiest way is to use the comment
      option on the individual PR's web page, which you can reach
      from the <link
	xlink:href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi">PR
	search page</link>.</para>

    <para>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just add a comment
      saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</para>

    <para>Sometimes there is a delay of a week or two where the
      problem report remains untouched, not assigned or commented on
      by anyone.  This can happen when there is an increased problem
      report backlog or during a holiday season.  When a problem
      report has not received attention after several weeks, it is
      worth finding a committer particularly interested in working on
      it.</para>

    <para>There are a few ways to do so, ideally in the following
      order, with a few days between attempting each communication
      channel:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Find the relevant &os; mailing list for the problem
	  report from the <link
	    xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">list
	    in the Handbook</link> and send a message to that list
	  asking about assistance or comments on the problem
	  report.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Join the relevant <acronym>IRC</acronym> channels.
	  A partial listing is here: <link
	    xlink:href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/IrcChannels"></link>.
	  Inform the people in that channel about the problem report
	  and ask for assistance.  Be patient and stay in the channel
	  after posting, so that the people from different time zones
	  around the world have a chance to catch up.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Find committers interested in the problem that was
	  reported.  If the problem was in a particular tool, binary,
	  port, document, or source file, check the <link
	    xlink:href="http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org">SVN
	    Repository</link>.  Locate the last few committers who
	  made substantive changes to the file, and try to reach them
	  via <acronym>IRC</acronym> or email.  A list of committers
	  and their emails can be found in the <link
	    xlink:href="&url.articles.contributors.en;">Contributors
	    to &os;</link> article.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Remember that these people are volunteers, just like
      maintainers and users, so they might not be immediately
      available to assist with the problem report.  Patience and
      consistency in the follow-ups is highly advised and appreciated.
      With enough care and effort dedicated to that follow-up process,
      finding a committer to take care of the problem report is just a
      matter of time.</para>

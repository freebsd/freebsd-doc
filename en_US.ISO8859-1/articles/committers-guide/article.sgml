    <para>It is required that you use &man.ssh.1; or &man.telnet.1;
      with Kerberos 5 to connect to the project hosts.  For
      &man.ssh.1; only protocol 2 is allowed.
      These are generally more secure than plain &man.telnet.1; or
      &man.rlogin.1; since credential negotiation will always be
      encrypted.  All traffic is encrypted by default with &man.ssh.1;.
      With utilities like &man.ssh-agent.1; and &man.scp.1; also
      available, &man.ssh.1; is also far more convenient.  If you do
      not know anything about &man.ssh.1;, please see

    <title>Commit Bit Types</title>

    <para>The FreeBSD repository has a number of components which,
      when combined, support the basic operating system source,
      documentation, third party application ports infrastructure, and
      various maintained utilities.  When FreeBSD commit bits are
      allocated, the areas of the tree where the bit may be used are
      specified.  Generally, the areas associated with a bit reflect who
      authorized the allocation of the commit bit.  Additional areas of
      authority may be added at a later date: when this occurs, the
      committer should follow normal commit bit allocation procedures for
      that area of the tree, seeking approval from the appropriate entity
      and possibly getting a mentor for that area for some period of time.

    <para>Commit bits allocated prior to the development of the notion of
      areas of authority may be appropriate for use in many parts of the
      tree.  However, common sense dictates that a committer who has not
      previously worked in an area of the tree seek review prior to
      committing, seek approval from the appropriate responsible party,
      and/or work with a mentor.  Since the rules regarding code
      maintenance differ by area of the tree, this is as much for the
      benefit of the committer working in an area of less familiarity as
      it is for others working on the tree.</para>

    <para>Committers are encouraged to seek review for their work as part
      of the normal development process, regardless of the area of the
      tree where the work is occurring.</para>

    <title>Version Control System Operations</title>

    <para>It is assumed that you are already familiar with the basic operation
      of the version control systems in use.  Traditionally this was
      CVS, but as of June 2008, Subversion is used for the src tree.</para>

    <para>The &a.cvsadm; are the <quote>owners</quote> of the repository and
      are responsible for direct modification of it for the purposes of
      cleanup or fixing some unfortunate abuse of the version control system by a committer.
      Should you cause some repository accident, say a bad
      import or a bad tag creation, mail the
      responsible part of &a.cvsadm;, as stated in the table below,
      (or call one of them) and report the problem.
      For very important issues affecting the entire tree&mdash;not
      just a specific area&mdash;you can contact the &a.cvsadm;.
      Please do <emphasis>not</emphasis> contact the &a.cvsadm; for repocopies
      or other things that the more specific teams can handle.</para>

    <para><anchor id="repomeisters">The only ones able to directly fiddle the repository bits on the
      repository hosts are the repomeisters.  To enforce this, there are
      no login shells available on the repository machines, except to

    <note><para>Depending on the affected area of the repository,
      you should send your request for a repocopy to one of the following email
      addresses.  Email sent to these addresses will be forwarded
      to the appropriate repomeisters.</para>

    <para>The &os; repositories are currently split into four distinct parts,
      namely <literal>doc</literal>, <literal>ports</literal>,
      <literal>projects</literal> and <literal>src</literal>.  These are
      combined under a single <literal>CVSROOT</literal> when distributed
      via <application>CVSup</application> for the convenience of our users.
      The <literal>src</literal> tree is automatically exported to
      CVS for compatibility reasons only (e.g.
      <application>CVSup</application>).  The <quote>official</quote>
      <literal>src</literal> repository is not stored in
      <application>CVS</application> but in Subversion.  The official
      and exported trees are not necessarily equal.</para>

    <note><para>Note that the <literal>www</literal> module containing sources
      for the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD website</ulink> is
      contained within the <literal>doc</literal> repository.</para></note>

    <para>The CVS repositories are hosted on the repository machines.
      Currently, each of the repositories above reside on the same physical
      machine, <hostid role="hostname">ncvs.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, but to allow for
      the possibility of placing each on a separate machine in the future,
      there is a separate hostname for each that committers should use.
      Additionally, each repository is stored in a separate directory.  The
      following table summarizes the situation.</para>

    <para>CVS operations are done remotely by setting the
      <envar>CVSROOT</envar> environment variable to the appropriate host
      and top-level directory (for example,
      <hostid role="fqdn">dcvs.FreeBSD.org</hostid><literal>:</literal><filename>/home/dcvs</filename>),
      and
      doing the appropriate check-out/check-in operations.  Many committers
      define aliases which expand to the correct <application>cvs</application>
      invocation for the appropriate repository.  For example, a &man.tcsh.1;
      user may add the following to their <filename>.cshrc</filename> for this
      purpose:</para>

    <programlisting>alias dcvs cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@dcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/dcvs
alias pcvs cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@pcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/pcvs
alias projcvs cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@projcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/projcvs</programlisting>

    <para>This way they can do all CVS operations
      locally and use <command><replaceable>X</replaceable>cvs commit</command> for committing
      to the official CVS repository.
      Refer to the &man.cvs.1; manual page for usage.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Please do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use
	<command>cvs checkout</command> or
	<command>update</command> with the official repository machine set
	as the CVS Root for keeping your source tree up to date.
	Remote CVS is not optimized for network distribution
	and requires a big work/administrative overhead on the server side.
	Please use our advanced <command>cvsup</command> distribution
	method for obtaining the repository bits, and only do the actual
	<command>commit</command> operation on the repository host.
	We provide an extensive cvsup replication network for this purpose,
	as well as give access to <hostid>cvsup-master</hostid> if you
	really need to stay current to the latest changes.
	<hostid>cvsup-master</hostid> has got the horsepower to deal with
	this, the repository master server does not.  &a.kuriyama; is in
	charge of <hostid>cvsup-master</hostid>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>If you need to use CVS <command>add</command> and
      <command>delete</command> operations in a manner that is
      effectively a &man.mv.1; operation, then a repository
      copy is in order rather than using CVS <command>add</command> and
      <command>delete</command>.  In a repository copy, a <link
      linkend="repomeisters">repomeister</link> will copy the file(s)
      to their new name and/or location and let you know when it is
      done.  The purpose of a repository copy is to preserve file
      change history, or logs.  We in the FreeBSD Project greatly
      value the change history that a version control system gives to the project.</para>

	<para>Merging is what happens if you check out a copy of

	<para>You always want to use <option>-u</option>, since

	  diff format (in some circumstances, context diffs generated with

	  better, but they are much bulkier). A unified diff consists of
	  a series of hunks. Each hunk begins with a line that starts
	  with two <literal>@</literal> signs and specifies where in the
	  file the differences are and how many lines they span. This
	  is followed by a number of lines; some (preceded by a blank)
	  are context; some (preceded by a <literal>-</literal> sign)
	  are outtakes and some (preceded by a <literal>+</literal>) are

	<para>Good commit messages are important. They tell others
	  why you did the changes you did, not just right here and now,
	  but months or years from now when someone wonders why some
	  seemingly illogical or inefficient piece of code sneaked into
	  your source file. It is also an invaluable aid to deciding
	  which changes to MFC and which not to MFC.</para>

	<para>Commit messages should be clear, concise and provide
	  a reasonable summary to give an indication of what was
	  changed and why.</para>

	<para>Commit messages should provide enough information to
	  enable a third party to decide if the change is relevant to
	  them and if they need to read the change itself.</para>

	<para>Avoid committing several unrelated changes in one go. It
	  makes merging difficult, and also makes it harder to determine
	  which change is the culprit if a bug crops up.</para>

	<para>Avoid committing style or whitespace fixes and
	  functionality fixes in one go. It makes merging difficult,
	  and also makes it harder to understand just what functional
	  changes were made.  In the case of documentation files, it
	  can make the job of the translation teams more complicated,
	  as it becomes difficult for them to determine exactly what
	  content changes need to be translated.</para>

	<para>Avoid committing changes to multiple files in one go
	  with a generic, vague message. Instead, commit each file (or
	  small, related groups of files) with tailored commit messages.</para>

	<para>Before committing, <emphasis>always</emphasis>:</para>

	<para>Do not leave the <command>cvs commit</command> command in commit

	  <command>cvs commit</command> and insert it into the commit
	  message or save it in a file before committing and use the
	  <option>-F</option> option of CVS to read the commit message from
	  that file, i.e.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>vi logmsg</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cvs ci -F logmsg shazam</userinput></screen>

	<para>This is the fastest way of passing a commit message to CVS but

    <para>The &os; project strongly discourages the so-called
      "advertising clause" in new code.  Due to the large number of
      contributors to the &os; project, complying with this clause for
      many commercial vendors has become difficult.  If you have code
      in the tree with the advertising clause, please consider
      removing it.  In fact, please consider using the above license
      for your code.</para>

    <para>The &os; project discourages completely new licenses and
      variations on the standard licenses.  New licenses require the
      approval of <email>core@FreeBSD.org</email> to reside in the
      main repository.  The more different licenses that are used in
      the tree, the more problems that this causes to those wishing to
      utilize this code, typically from unintended consequences from a
      poorly worded license.</para>

    <para>Project policy dictates that code under some non-BSD licenses
      must be placed only in specific sections of the repository, and
      in some cases, compilation must be conditional or even disabled
      by default.  For example, the GENERIC kernel must be compiled
      under only licenses identical to or substantially similar to the
      BSD license.  GPL, APSL, CDDL, etc, licensed software must not be
      compiled into GENERIC.</para>

    <para>Developers are reminded that in open source, getting "open"
      right is just as important as getting "source" right, as improper
      handling of intellectual property has serious consequences.  Any
      questions or concerns should immediately be brought to the
      attention of the core team.</para>

    <title>Developer Relations</title>

    <para>If you are working directly on your own code or on code
      which is already well established as your responsibility, then
      there is probably little need to check with other committers
      before jumping in with a commit.  If you see a bug in an area of
      the system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  If, however, you are
      about to modify something which is clearly being actively
      maintained by someone else (and it is only by watching the
      <literal><replaceable>repository</replaceable>-committers</literal> mailing list that you can
      really get a feel for just what is and is not) then consider
      sending the change to them instead, just as you would have
      before becoming a committer.  For ports, you should contact the
      listed <makevar>MAINTAINER</makevar> in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For other parts of the
      repository, if you are unsure who the active maintainer might
      be, it may help to scan the revision history
      to see who has committed changes in the past.  &a.fenner; has
      written a nice shell script that can help determine who the
      active maintainer might be.  It lists each person who has
      committed to a given file along with the number of commits each
      person has made.  It can be found on <hostid>freefall</hostid>
      at <filename>~fenner/bin/whodid</filename>.  If your queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit
      it.</para>

    <para>If you are unsure about a commit for any reason at
      all, have it reviewed by <literal>-hackers</literal>
      before committing.  Better to have it flamed then and there
      rather than when it is part of the repository.  If you do
      happen to commit something which results in controversy
      erupting, you may also wish to consider backing the change out
      again until the matter is settled.  Remember &ndash; with a version control system we
      can always change it back.</para>

    <para>Do not impugn the intentions of someone you disagree with.
      If they see a different solution to a problem than you, or even
      a different problem, it is not because they are stupid, because
      they have questionable parentage, or because they are trying to
      destroy your hard work, personal image, or FreeBSD, but simply
      because they have a different outlook on the world.  Different
      is good.</para>

    <para>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</para>

    <para>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</para>

    <para>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of
      the ways open source software is supposed to excel is in the
      number of eyeballs applied to it; this does not apply if nobody
      will review code.</para>

	<para>If you are not already downloading the GNATS tree, add this line

    <para>As noted, breaking some of these rules can be grounds for
      suspension or, upon repeated offense, permanent removal of
      commit privileges.  Individual members of core
      have the power to temporarily suspend commit privileges until
      core as a whole has the chance to review the
      issue.  In case of an <quote>emergency</quote> (a committer
      doing damage to the repository), a temporary suspension may also
      be done by the repository meisters.
      Only a 2/3 majority of core
      has the authority to suspend commit privileges for longer
      than a week or to remove them permanently.
      This rule does not exist to set core up as a bunch
      of cruel dictators who can dispose of committers as casually as
      empty soda cans, but to give the project a kind of safety fuse.
      If someone is out of control, it is important to be
      able to deal with this immediately rather than be paralyzed by
      debate.  In all cases, a committer whose privileges are
      suspended or revoked is entitled to a <quote>hearing</quote> by core,
      the total duration of the suspension being determined at that
      time.  A committer whose privileges are suspended may also
      request a review of the decision after 30 days and every 30 days
      thereafter (unless the total suspension period is less than 30
      days).  A committer whose privileges have been revoked entirely
      may request a review after a period of 6 months has elapsed.
      This review policy is <emphasis>strictly informal</emphasis>
      and, in all cases, core reserves the right to either act on or
      disregard requests for review if they feel their original
      decision to be the right one.</para>

    <para>In all other aspects of project operation, core is a subset
      of committers and is bound by the <emphasis>same
      rules</emphasis>.  Just because someone is in core this does not mean
      that they have special dispensation to step outside any of
      the lines painted here; core's <quote>special powers</quote>
      only kick in when it acts as a group, not on an individual
      basis.  As individuals, the core team members are all committers
      first and core second.</para>

      <title>Details</title>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem id="respect">
	  <para>Respect other committers.</para>

	  <para>This means that you need to treat other committers as
	    the peer-group developers that they are.  Despite our
	    occasional attempts to prove the contrary, one does not get
	    to be a committer by being stupid and nothing rankles more
	    than being treated that way by one of your peers.  Whether
	    we always feel respect for one another or not (and
	    everyone has off days), we still have to
	    <emphasis>treat</emphasis> other committers with respect
	    at all times, on public forums and in private email.</para>

	  <para>Being able to work together long term is this project's
	    greatest asset, one far more important than any set of
	    changes to the code, and turning arguments about code into
	    issues that affect our long-term ability to work
	    harmoniously together is just not worth the trade-off by
	    any conceivable stretch of the imagination.</para>

	  <para>To comply with this rule, do not send email when you are
	    angry or otherwise behave in a manner which is likely to
	    strike others as needlessly confrontational.  First calm
	    down, then think about how to communicate in the most
	    effective fashion for convincing the other person(s) that
	    your side of the argument is correct, do not just blow off
	    some steam so you can feel better in the short term at the
	    cost of a long-term flame war.  Not only is this very bad
	    <quote>energy economics</quote>, but repeated displays of
	    public aggression which impair our ability to work well
	    together will be dealt with severely by the project
	    leadership and may result in suspension or termination of
	    your commit privileges.  The project leadership will
	    take into account both public and private communications
	    brought before it.  It will not seek the disclosure of
	    private communications, but it will take it into account
	    if it is volunteered by the committers involved in the
	    complaint.</para>

	    <para>All of this is never an option which the
	    project's leadership enjoys in the slightest, but unity
	    comes first.  No amount of code or good advice is worth
	    trading that away.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Respect other contributors.</para>

	  <para>You were not always a committer. At one time you were
	    a contributor. Remember that at all times. Remember what
	    it was like trying to get help and attention.  Do not forget
	    that your work as a contributor was very important to
	    you.  Remember what it was like. Do not discourage, belittle,
	    or demean contributors.  Treat them with respect.  They are
	    our committers in waiting.  They are every bit as important
	    to the project as committers. Their contributions are as
	    valid and as important as your own.  After all, you made
	    many contributions before you became a committer.  Always
	    remember that.  </para>

	  <para>Consider the points raised under <xref linkend="respect">
	    and apply them also to contributors.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Discuss any significant change
	    <emphasis>before</emphasis> committing.</para>

	  <para>The repository is not where changes should be
	    initially submitted for correctness or argued over, that
	    should happen first in the mailing lists and the commit should
	    only happen once something resembling consensus has
	    been reached.  This does not mean that you have to ask
	    permission before correcting every obvious syntax error or
	    manual page misspelling, simply that you should try to
	    develop a feel for when a proposed change is not quite such
	    a no-brainer and requires some feedback first.  People
	    really do not mind sweeping changes if the result is
	    something clearly better than what they had before, they
	    just do not like being <emphasis>surprised</emphasis> by
	    those changes.  The very best way of making sure that
	    you are on the right track is to have your code reviewed by
	    one or more other committers.</para>

	  <para>When in doubt, ask for review!</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Respect existing maintainers if listed.</para>

	  <para>Many parts of FreeBSD are not <quote>owned</quote> in
	    the sense that any specific individual will jump up and
	    yell if you commit a change to <quote>their</quote> area,
	    but it still pays to check first.  One convention we use
	    is to put a maintainer line in the
	    <filename>Makefile</filename> for any package or subtree
	    which is being actively maintained by one or more people;
	    see <ulink
	      url="&url.books.developers-handbook;/policies.html">
	      http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/policies.html</ulink>
	    for documentation on this.  Where sections of code have
	    several maintainers, commits to affected areas by one
	    maintainer need to be reviewed by at least one other
	    maintainer.  In cases where the
	    <quote>maintainer-ship</quote> of something is not clear,
	    you can also look at the repository logs for the file(s) in
	    question and see if someone has been working recently or
	    predominantly in that area.</para>

	  <para>Other areas of FreeBSD fall under the control of
	    someone who manages an overall category of FreeBSD
	    evolution, such as internationalization or networking.
	    See <ulink

	    discretion.</para>

	  <para>This may be hard to swallow in times of conflict (when
	    each side is convinced that they are in the right, of
	    course) but a version control system makes it unnecessary to have an ongoing
	    dispute raging when it is far easier to simply reverse the
	    disputed change, get everyone calmed down again and then
	    try to figure out what is the best way to proceed.  If the change
	    turns out to be the best thing after all, it can be easily
	    brought back. If it turns out not to be, then the users
	    did not have to live with the bogus change in the tree
	    while everyone was busily debating its merits.  People
	    <emphasis>very</emphasis> rarely call for back-outs in the repository
	    since discussion generally exposes bad or controversial
	    changes before the commit even happens, but on such rare
	    occasions the back-out should be done without argument so
	    that we can get immediately on to the topic of figuring
	    out whether it was bogus or not.</para>

	  <para>Changes go to &os.current; before
	    &os.stable; unless specifically permitted

	    non-urgent change which is applicable should also be
	    allowed to sit in &os.current; for at least
	    3 days before merging so that it can be given sufficient
	    testing.  The release engineer has the same authority over
	    the &os.stable; branch as outlined in rule
	    #5.</para>

	  <para>This is another <quote>do not argue about it</quote>
	    issue since it is the release engineer who is ultimately
	    responsible (and gets beaten up) if a change turns out to
	    be bad.  Please respect this and give the release engineer
	    your full cooperation when it comes to the
	    &os.stable; branch.  The management of
	    &os.stable; may frequently seem to be
	    overly conservative to the casual observer, but also bear
	    in mind the fact that conservatism is supposed to be the
	    hallmark of &os.stable; and different rules
	    apply there than in &os.current;.  There is
	    also really no point in having &os.current;
	    be a testing ground if changes are merged over to
	    &os.stable; immediately.  Changes need a
	    chance to be tested by the &os.current;
	    developers, so allow some time to elapse before merging
	    unless the &os.stable; fix is critical,
	    time sensitive or so obvious as to make further testing
	    unnecessary (spelling fixes to manual pages, obvious bug/typo
	    fixes, etc.)  In other words, apply common sense.</para>

	  <para>Changes to the security branches
	    (for example, <literal>RELENG_7_0</literal>) must be

	  <para>Do not fight in public with other committers; it looks

	  <para>This project has a public image to uphold and that
	    image is very important to all of us, especially if we are
	    to continue to attract new members.  There will be
	    occasions when, despite everyone's very best attempts at
	    self-control, tempers are lost and angry words are
	    exchanged.  The best thing that can be done in such cases is to minimize
	    the effects of this until everyone has cooled back down.  That
	    means that you should not air your angry words in public
	    and you should not forward private correspondence to
	    public mailing lists or aliases.  What people say
	    one-to-one is often much less sugar-coated than what they
	    would say in public, and such communications therefore
	    have no place there - they only serve to inflame an
	    already bad situation. If the person sending you a
	    flame-o-gram at least had the grace to send it privately,
	    then have the grace to keep it private yourself.  If you
	    feel you are being unfairly treated by another developer,
	    and it is causing you anguish, bring the matter up with
	    core rather than taking it public.  Core will do its best to
	    play peace makers and get things back to sanity.  In cases
	    where the dispute involves a change to the codebase and
	    the participants do not appear to be reaching an amicable
	    agreement, core may appoint a mutually-agreeable 3rd party
	    to resolve the dispute.  All parties involved must then
	    agree to be bound by the decision reached by this 3rd

      <title>Policy on Multiple Architectures</title>

      <para>FreeBSD has added several new architecture ports during recent
	release cycles and is truly no longer an &i386; centric operating
	system.  In an effort to make it easier to keep FreeBSD portable
	across the platforms we support, core has developed the following
	mandate:</para>

	<blockquote>
	  <para>Our 32-bit reference platform is i386, and our 64-bit
	    reference platform is Sparc64.  Major design work (including
	    major API and ABI changes) must prove itself on at least one
	    32-bit and at least one 64-bit platform, preferably the
	    primary reference platforms, before it may be committed
	    to the source tree.</para>
	</blockquote>

      <para>The i386 and Sparc64 platforms were chosen due to being more
	readily available to developers and as representatives of more
	diverse processor and system designs - big vs little endian,
	register file vs register stack, different DMA and cache
	implementations, hardware page tables vs software TLB management
	etc.</para>

      <para>The ia64 platform has many of the same complications that
	Sparc64 has, but is still limited in availability to
	developers.</para>

      <para>We will continue to re-evaluate this policy as cost and
	availability of the 64-bit platforms change.</para>

      <para>Developers should also be aware of our Tier Policy for
	the long term support of hardware architectures.  The rules
	here are intended to provide guidance during the development
	process, and are distinct from the requirements for features
	and architectures listed in that section.  The Tier rules for
	feature support on architectures at release-time are more
	strict than the rules for changes during the development
	process.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Other Suggestions</title>

      <para>When committing documentation changes, use a spell checker
	before committing.  For all SGML docs, you should also
	verify that your formatting directives are correct by running
	<command>make lint</command>.</para>

      <para>For all on-line manual pages, run <command>manck</command>
	(from ports) over the manual page to verify all of the cross
	references and file references are correct and that the man
	page has all of the appropriate <makevar>MLINK</makevar>s
	installed.</para>

      <para>Do not mix style fixes with new functionality.  A style
	fix is any change which does not modify the functionality of
	the code.  Mixing the changes obfuscates the functionality
	change when asking for differences between revisions, which can hide 
	any new bugs.  Do not include whitespace changes with content
	changes in commits to <filename>doc/</filename> or
	<filename>www/</filename>.  The extra clutter in the diffs
	makes the translators' job much more difficult.  Instead, make
	any style or whitespace changes in separate commits that are
	clearly labeled as such in the commit message.</para>

      <title>Deprecating Features</title>

    <title>Support for Multiple Architectures</title>

    <para>FreeBSD is a highly portable operating system intended to
      function on many different types of hardware architectures.
      Maintaining clean separation of Machine Dependent (MD) and Machine
      Independent (MI) code, as well as minimizing MD code, is an important
      part of our strategy to remain agile with regards to current
      hardware trends.  Each new hardware architecture supported by
      FreeBSD adds substantially to the cost of code maintenance,
      toolchain support, and release engineering.  It also dramatically
      increases the cost of effective testing of kernel changes.  As such,
      there is strong motivation to differentiate between classes of
      support for various architectures while remaining strong in a few
      key architectures that are seen as the FreeBSD "target audience".
      </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Statement of General Intent</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD Project targets "production quality commercial
	off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end embedded
	systems".  By retaining a focus on a narrow set of architectures
	of interest in these environments, the FreeBSD Project is able
	to maintain high levels of quality, stability, and performance,
	as well as minimize the load on various support teams on the
	project, such as the ports team, documentation team,
	security officer, and release engineering teams.  Diversity in
	hardware support broadens the options for FreeBSD consumers by
	offering new features and usage opportunities (such as support
	for 64-bit CPUs, use in embedded environments, etc.), but these
	benefits must always be carefully considered in terms of the real-world
	maintenance cost associated with additional platform support.
	</para>

      <para>The FreeBSD Project differentiates platform targets into
	four tiers.  Each tier includes a specification of the
	requirements for an architecture to be in that tier,
	as well as specifying the obligations of developers with
	regards to the platform.  In addition, a policy is defined
	regarding the circumstances required to change the tier
	of an architecture.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Tier 1: Fully Supported Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 1 platforms are fully supported by the security
	officer, release engineering, and toolchain maintenance staff.
	New features added to the operating system must be fully
	functional across all Tier 1 architectures for every release
	(features which are inherently architecture-specific, such as
	support for hardware device drivers, may be exempt from this
	requirement).  In general, all Tier 1 platforms must have build
	and Tinderbox support either in the FreeBSD.org cluster, or be
	easily available for all developers.  Embedded platforms may
	substitute an emulator available in the FreeBSD cluster for
	actual hardware.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be Production Quality
	with respects to all aspects of the FreeBSD operating system,
	including installation and development environments.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be completely
        integrated into the source tree and have all features
	necessary to produce an entire system relevant for that target
        architecture.  Tier 1 architectures generally have at least 6 active
        developers.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be fully supported by
        the ports system.  All the ports should build on a Tier 1
        platform, or have the appropriate filters to prevent the
        inappropriate ones from building there.  The packaging system
        must support all Tier 1 architectures.  To ensure an
        architecture's Tier 1 status, proponents of that architecture
        must show that all relevant packages can be built on that
        platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 embedded architectures must be able to cross-build
        packages on at least one other Tier 1 architecture.  The
        packages must be the most relevant for the platform, but may
        be a non-empty subset of those that build natively.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures must be fully documented.  All basic
        operations need to be covered by the handbook or other
        documents.  All relevant integration documentation must also
        be integrated into the tree, or readily available.</para>

      <para>Current Tier 1 platforms are i386, AMD64, and PC98.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Tier 2: Developmental Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 2 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  Platform maintainers are
	responsible for toolchain support in the tree.  The toolchain
	maintainer is expected to work with the platform maintainers
	to refine these changes.  Major new toolchain components are
	allowed to break support for Tier 2 architectures if the
	FreeBSD-local changes have not been incorporated upstream.  The
	toolchain maintainers are expected to provide prompt review of
	any proposed changes and cannot block, through their inaction,
	changes going into the tree.  New features added to FreeBSD
	should be feasible to implement on these platforms, but an
	implementation is not required before the feature may be added
	to the FreeBSD source tree. New features that may be difficult
	to implement on Tier 2 architectures should provide a means of
	disabling them on those architectures.  The implementation of
	a Tier 2 architecture may be committed to the main FreeBSD
	tree as long as it does not interfere with production work on
	Tier 1 platforms, or substantially with other Tier 2 platforms.
	Before a Tier 2 platform can be added to the FreeBSD base
	source tree, the platform must be able to boot multi-user on
	actual hardware.  Generally, there must be at least three active
	developers working on the platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures are usually systems targeted at Tier 1
	support, but that are still under development.  Architectures
	reaching end of life may also be moved from Tier 1 status to Tier
	2 status as the availability of resources to continue to maintain
	the system in a Production Quality state diminishes.  Well supported
        niche architectures may also be Tier 2.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures may have some support for them
        integrated into the ports infrastructure.  They may have cross
        compilation support added, at the discretion of portmgr.  Some
        ports must built natively into packages if the package system
        supports that architecture.  If not integrated into the base
        system, some external patches for the architecture for ports
        must be available.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures can be integrated into the FreeBSD
        handbook.  The basics for how to get a system running must be
        documented, although not necessarily for every single board or
        system a Tier 2 architecture supports.  The supported hardware
        list must exist and should be no more than a couple of months
        old.  It should be integrated into the FreeBSD
        documentation.</para>

      <para>Current Tier 2 platforms are ARM, PowerPC, ia64, Sparc64 and
        sun4v.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Tier 3: Experimental Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  At the discretion of the
	toolchain maintainer, they may be supported in the toolchain.
	Tier 3 platforms are architectures in the early stages of
	development, for non-mainstream hardware platforms, or which
	are considered legacy systems unlikely to see broad future
	use.  New Tier 3 systems will not be committed to the base
	source tree.  Support for Tier 3 systems may be worked on in
	the FreeBSD Perforce Repository, providing source control and
	easier change integration from the main FreeBSD tree.
	Platforms that transition to Tier 3 status may be removed from
	the tree if they are no longer actively supported by the
	FreeBSD developer community at the discretion of the release
	engineer.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms may have ports support, either integrated
        or external, but do not require it.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms must have the basics documented for how
        to build a kernel and how to boot it on at least one target
        hardware or emulation environment.  This documentation need
        not be integrated into the FreeBSD tree.</para>

	    <para>The easiest way to add a new port is to use the

	      in the <filename>ports/Tools/scripts</filename> directory).
	      It will add a port from the
	      directory you specify, determining the category automatically
	      from the port <filename>Makefile</filename>.
	      It will also add an entry to the port's
	      category <filename>Makefile</filename>.  It was

	<title>Repository Copies</title>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>When do we need a repository copy?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When you want to add a port that is related to
	      any port that is already in the tree in a separate
	      directory, you have to do a repository copy.
	      Here <wordasword>related</wordasword> means
	      it is a different version or a slightly modified
	      version.  Examples are
	      <filename>print/ghostscript*</filename> (different
	      versions) and <filename>x11-wm/windowmaker*</filename>
	      (English-only and internationalized version).</para>

	    <para>Another example is when a port is moved from one
	      subdirectory to another, or when you want to change the
	      name of a directory because the author(s) renamed their
	      software even though it is a
	      descendant of a port already in a tree.</para>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When there is no history to preserve.  If a port is
	      added into a wrong category and is moved immediately,
	      it suffices to simply <command>cvs remove</command> the

	  <question>
	    <para>What is a <quote>ports slush</quote> or
	      <quote>feature freeze</quote>?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>During a release cycle the ports tree may be in a
	      <quote>slush</quote> state instead of in a hard freeze.
	      The goal during a slush is to reach a stable ports tree
	      to avoid rebuilding large sets of packages for the
	      release and to tag the tree.  During this time
	      <quote>sweeping changes</quote> are prohibited unless
	      specifically permitted by portmgr.  Complete details
	      about what qualifies as a sweeping change can be found
	      on the <ulink
	      url="&url.base/portmgr/implementation.html">Portmgr
	      Implementation page</ulink>.</para>

	    <para>The benefit of a slush as opposed to a complete
	      freeze is that it allows maintainers to continue adding
	      new ports, making routine version updates, and bug fixes
	      to most existing ports, as long as the number of
	      affected ports is minimal.  For example, updating the
	      shared library version on a port that many other ports

	      announcing the start of the impending release, usually
	      two or three weeks in advance.  The exact starting time
	      will not be determined until a few days before the
	      actual release.  This is because the ports slush has to
	      be synchronized with the release, and it is usually not
	      known until then when exactly the release will be
	      rolled.</para>

	<title>Creating a New Category</title>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>What is the procedure for creating a new category?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Please see
	      <ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;/makefile-categories.html#PROPOSING-CATEGORIES">
	      Proposing a New Category</ulink> in the Porter's Handbook.
	      Once that procedure has been followed and the PR has been
	      assigned to &a.portmgr;, it is their decision whether or
	      not to approve it.  If they do, it is their responsibility
	      to do the following:</para>

	    <procedure>
	      <step>
		<para>Perform any needed repocopies.  (This only applies
		  to physical categories.)</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>Update the <makevar>VALID_CATEGORIES</makevar>
		  definition in <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>.
		</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>Assign the PR back to you.</para>
	      </step>
	    </procedure>
	  </answer>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>What do I need to do to implement a new physical
	      category?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The procedure is a strict superset of the one to
	      repocopy individual ports (see above).</para>

	      <procedure>
		<step>
		  <para>Upgrade each copied port's
		    <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Do not connect the
		    new category to the build yet.</para>

		  <para>To do this, you will need to:</para>
		    <procedure>
		      <step>
			<para>Change the port's <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar>
			  (this was the point of the exercise, remember?)
			  The new category should be listed
			  <emphasis>first</emphasis>.  This will help to
			  ensure that the <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>
			  is correct.</para>
		      </step>

		      <step>
			<para>Run a <command>make describe</command>.  Since
			  the top-level <command>make index</command> that
			  you will be running in a few steps is an iteration
			  of <command>make describe</command> over the entire
			  ports hierarchy, catching any errors here will
			  save you having to re-run that step later on.</para>
		      </step>

		      <step>
			<para>If you want to be really thorough, now might
			  be a good time to run &man.portlint.1;.</para>
		      </step>
		    </procedure>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Check that the <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>s are
		    correct.  The ports system uses each port's
		    <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> entry to create
		    its <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>, which is used to
		    connect installed packages to the port directory they
		    were built from. If this entry is wrong, common port
		    tools like &man.pkg.version.1; and
		    &man.portupgrade.1; fail.</para>

		  <para>To do this, use the <filename>chkorigin.sh</filename>
		    tool, as follows: <command>env
		    PORTSDIR=<replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>
		    sh -e <replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>/Tools/scripts/chkorigin.sh
		    </command>.  This will check <emphasis>every</emphasis>
		    port in the ports tree, even those not connected to the
		    build, so you can run it directly after the repocopy.
		    Hint: do not forget to look at the
		    <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>s of any slave ports of the
		    ports you just repocopied!</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>On your own local system, test the proposed
		    changes: first, comment out the
		    <makevar>SUBDIR</makevar> entries in the old
		    ports' categories' <filename>Makefile</filename>s;
		    then enable building the new category in
		    <filename>ports/Makefile</filename>.
		    Run <command>make checksubdirs</command> in the
		    affected category directories to check the
		    <makevar>SUBDIR</makevar> entries.  Next, in
		    the <filename class="directory">ports/</filename>
		    directory, run <command>make index</command>.  This
		    can take over 40 minutes on even modern systems;
		    however, it is a necessary step to prevent problems
		    for other people.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Once this is done, you can commit the
		    updated <filename>ports/Makefile</filename> to
		    connect the new category to the build and also
		    commit the <filename>Makefile</filename> changes
		    for the old category or categories.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Add appropriate entries to
		    <filename>ports/MOVED</filename>.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Update the instructions for &man.cvsup.1;:</para>

		  <itemizedlist>
		    <listitem>
		      <para>
			add the category to
			<filename>distrib/cvsup/sup/README</filename>
		      </para>

			add the category to
			<filename>src/share/examples/cvsup/ports-supfile</filename>
		      </para>
		    </listitem>
		  </itemizedlist>

		  <para>
		    (Note: these are
		    in the src, not the ports, repository).  If you
		    are not a src committer, you will need to submit
		    a PR for this.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>
		    Update the list of categories used by &man.sysinstall.8;
		    in <filename>src/usr.sbin/sysinstall</filename>.</para>
		</step>

		    in the docs, not the ports, repository).  If you
		    are not a docs committer, you will need to submit
		    a PR for this.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Only once all the above have been done, and
		    no one is any longer reporting problems with the
		    new ports, should the old ports be deleted from
		    their previous locations in the repository.</para>
		</step>

	<title>Miscellaneous Questions</title>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>How do I know if my port is building correctly or
	      not?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>First, go check
	      <ulink url="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/"></ulink>.
	      There you will find error logs from the latest package
	      building runs on all supported platforms for the most
	      recent branches.</para>

	    <para>However, just because the port does not show up there
	      does not mean it is building correctly.  (One of the
	      dependencies may have failed, for instance.)  The relevant
	      directories are available on <hostid>pointyhat</hostid> under
	      <filename class="directory">/a/portbuild/&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;major_version&gt;</filename>
	      so feel free to dig around.  Each architecture and version has
	      the following subdirectories:</para>

<programlisting>errors        error logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
logs          all logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
packages      packages from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/errors    error logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/logs      all logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/packages  packages from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;</programlisting>

	    <para>Basically, if the port shows up in
	      <filename>packages</filename>, or it is in
	      <filename>logs</filename> but not in
	      <filename>errors</filename>, it built fine.  (The
	      <filename>errors</filename> directories are what you get
	      from the web page.)</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>I added a new port.  Do I need to add it to the
	      <filename>INDEX</filename>?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>No, <filename>INDEX</filename> is no longer stored
	      in the CVS repository.  The file can either be generated
	      by running <command>make index</command>, or a pre-generated
	      version can be downloaded with <command>make
	      fetchindex</command>.</para>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Are there any other files I am not allowed to
	      touch?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Any file directly under <filename>ports/</filename>, or
	      any file under a subdirectory that starts with an
	      uppercase letter (<filename>Mk/</filename>,
	      <filename>Tools/</filename>, etc.).  In particular, the
	      ports management team is very protective of
	      <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.port*.mk</filename> so do not
	      commit changes to those files unless you want to face his
	      wra(i)th.</para>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>What is the proper procedure for updating the checksum
	      for a port's distfile when the file changes without a
	      version change?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When the checksum for a port's distfile is updated due
	      to the author updating the file without changing the port's
	      revision, the commit message should include a summary of
	      the relevant diffs between the original and new distfile to
	      ensure that the distfile has not been corrupted or
	      maliciously altered.  If the current version of the port
	      has been in the ports tree for a while, a copy of the old
	      distfile will usually be available on the ftp servers;
	      otherwise the author or maintainer should be contacted to
	      find out why the distfile has changed.</para>

    <para>It is required that you use &man.ssh.1; or &man.telnet.1;
      with Kerberos 5 to connect to the project hosts.  For
      &man.ssh.1; only protocol 2 is allowed.
      These are generally more secure than plain &man.telnet.1; or
      &man.rlogin.1; since credential negotiation will always be
      encrypted.  All traffic is encrypted by default with &man.ssh.1;.
      With utilities like &man.ssh-agent.1; and &man.scp.1; also
      available, &man.ssh.1; is also far more convenient.  If you do
      not know anything about &man.ssh.1;, please see

    <title>Commit Bit Types</title>

    <para>The FreeBSD CVS repository has a number of components which,
      when combined, support the basic operating system source,
      documentation, third party application ports infrastructure, and
      various maintained utilities.  When FreeBSD commit bits are
      allocated, the areas of the tree where the bit may be used are
      specified.  Generally, the areas associated with a bit reflect who
      authorized the allocation of the commit bit.  Additional areas of
      authority may be added at a later date: when this occurs, the
      committer should follow normal commit bit allocation procedures for
      that area of the tree, seeking approval from the appropriate entity
      and possibly getting a mentor for that area for some period of time.
      </para>

    <para>Commit bits allocated prior to the development of the notion of
      areas of authority may be appropriate for use in many parts of the
      tree.  However, common sense dictates that a committer who has not
      previously worked in an area of the tree seek review prior to
      committing, seek approval from the appropriate responsible party,
      and/or work with a mentor.  Since the rules regarding code
      maintenance differ by area of the tree, this is as much for the
      benefit of the committer working in an area of less familiarity as
      it is for others working on the tree.</para>

    <para>Committers are encouraged to seek review for their work as part
      of the normal development process, regardless of the area of the
      tree where the work is occurring.</para>

    <title>CVS Operations</title>

    <para>It is assumed that you are already familiar with the basic operation
      of CVS.</para>

    <para>The &a.cvs; are the <quote>owners</quote> of the CVS repository and
      are responsible for direct modification of it for the purposes of
      cleanup or fixing some grievous abuse of CVS by a committer.
      Should you cause some repository accident, say a bad <command>cvs
      import</command> or <command>cvs tag</command> operation, mail the &a.cvs;
      (or call one of them) and report the problem to one of them.  The only
      ones able to directly fiddle the repository bits on the repository hosts
      are the repomeisters.  To enforce this, there are no login shells
      available on the repository machines, except to the repomeisters.</para>

    <para>The CVS tree is currently split into four distinct repositories,
      namely <literal>doc</literal>, <literal>ports</literal>,
      <literal>projects</literal> and <literal>src</literal>.  These are
      combined under a single <literal>CVSROOT</literal> when distributed
      via <application>CVSup</application> for the convenience of our users.</para>

    <note><para>Note that the <literal>www</literal> module containing sources
      for the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD website</ulink> is
      contained within the <literal>doc</literal> repository.</para></note>

    <para>The CVS repositories are hosted on the repository machines.
      Currently, each of the repositories above reside on the same physical
      machine, <hostid role="hostname">ncvs.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, but to allow for
      the possibility of placing each on a separate machine in the future,
      there is a separate hostname for each that committers should use.
      Additionally, each repository is stored in a separate directory.  The
      following table summarizes the situation.</para>

    <para>CVS operations are done remotely by setting the
      <envar>CVSROOT</envar> environment variable to the appropriate host
      and top-level directory (for example,
      <hostid role="fqdn">ncvs.FreeBSD.org</hostid><literal>:</literal><filename>/home/ncvs</filename>),
      the <envar>CVS_RSH</envar> variable to <command>ssh</command>, and then
      doing the appropriate check-out/check-in operations.  Many committers
      define aliases which expand to the correct <application>cvs</application>
      invocation for the appropriate repository.  For example, a &man.tcsh.1;
      user may add the following to their <filename>.cshrc</filename> for this
      purpose:</para>

    <programlisting>alias dcvs env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@dcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/dcvs
alias pcvs env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@pcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/pcvs
alias projcvs env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@projcvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/projcvs
alias scvs env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d <replaceable>user</replaceable>@ncvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/ncvs</programlisting>

    <para>This way they can do all CVS operations
      locally and use <command><replaceable>X</replaceable>cvs commit</command> for committing
      to the official CVS tree.  If you wish to add
      something which is wholly new (like contrib-ified
      sources, etc), <command>cvs import</command> should be used.
      Refer to the &man.cvs.1; manual page for usage.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Please do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use
	<command>cvs checkout</command> or
	<command>update</command> with the official repository machine set
	as the CVS Root for keeping your source tree up to date.
	Remote CVS is not optimized for network distribution
	and requires a big work/administrative overhead on the server side.
	Please use our advanced <command>cvsup</command> distribution
	method for obtaining the repository bits, and only do the actual
	<command>commit</command> operation on the repository host.
	We provide an extensive cvsup replication network for this purpose,
	as well as give access to <hostid>cvsup-master</hostid> if you
	really need to stay current to the latest changes.
	<hostid>cvsup-master</hostid> has got the horsepower to deal with
	this, the repository master server does not.  &a.kuriyama; is in
	charge of <hostid>cvsup-master</hostid>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>If you need to use CVS <command>add</command> and
      <command>delete</command> operations in a manner that is
      effectively a &man.mv.1; operation, then a repository
      copy is in order rather than using CVS <command>add</command> and
      <command>delete</command>.  In a repository copy, a <link
      linkend="conventions">CVS Meister</link> will copy the file(s)
      to their new name and/or location and let you know when it is
      done.  The purpose of a repository copy is to preserve file
      change history, or logs.  We in the FreeBSD Project greatly
      value the change history that CVS gives to the project.</para>

	<para>Merging is what happens if you check out a copy of
	  some source code, modify it, then someone else commits a
	  change, and you run <command>cvs update</command>. CVS notices
	  that you have made local changes, and tries to merge your
	  changes with the changes between the version you originally
	  checked out and the one you updated to. If the changes are to
	  separate portions of the file, it will almost always work fine
	  (though the result might not be syntactically or semantically
	  correct).</para>

	<para>CVS will print an <literal>M</literal> in front of every locally modified
	  file even if there is no newer version in the repository, so
	  <command>cvs update</command> is handy for getting a summary
	  of what you have changed locally.</para>

	<para>If you get a <literal>C</literal>, then your changes
	  conflicted with the changes in the repository (the changes
	  were to the same lines, or neighboring lines, or you changed
	  the local file so much that <command>cvs</command> can not
	  figure out how to apply the repository's changes). You will have
	  to go through the file manually and resolve the conflicts;
	  they will be marked with rows of <literal>&lt;</literal>,
	  <literal>=</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal> signs. For
	  every conflict, there will be a marker line with seven
	  <literal>&lt;</literal> signs and the name of the file,
	  followed by a chunk of what your local file contained,
	  followed by a separator line with seven <literal>=</literal>
	  signs, followed by the corresponding chunk in the
	  repository version, followed by a marker line with seven
	  <literal>&gt;</literal> signs and the revision number you
	  updated to.</para>

	<para>The <option>-j</option> option is slightly voodoo. It
	  updates the local file to the specified revision as if you
	  used <option>-r</option>, but it does not change the recorded
	  revision number or branch of the local file. It is not really
	  useful except when used twice, in which case it will merge the
	  changes between the two specified versions into the working
	  copy.</para>

	<para>For instance, say you commit a change to
	  <filename>shazam/shazam.c</filename> in &os.current; and later
	  want to MFC it.  The change you want to MFC was revision
	  1.15:</para>

	  <literal>$<!-- stop expansion -->FreeBSD<!-- stop expansion -->$</literal>)
	  lines, so you will have to edit the file to resolve the conflict
	  (remove the marker lines and the second <literal>$Id: article.sgml,v 1.191 2004-05-11 13:29:46 den Exp $</literal> line,

	<para>You always want to use <option>-u</option>, since
	  unified diffs are much easier to read than almost any other
	  diff format (in some circumstances, context diffs generated with
	  the <option>-c</option> option may be
	  better, but they are much bulkier). A unified diff consists of
	  a series of hunks. Each hunk begins with a line that starts
	  with two <literal>@</literal> signs and specifies where in the
	  file the differences are and how many lines they span. This
	  is followed by a number of lines; some (preceded by a blank)
	  are context; some (preceded by a <literal>-</literal> sign)
	  are outtakes and some (preceded by a <literal>+</literal>) are

	<para>You can also diff against a different version

	<para>Good commit messages are important. They tell others
	  why you did the changes you did, not just right here and now,

	<para>Commit messages should be clear, concise and provide

	<para>Commit messages should provide enough information to

	<para>Avoid committing several unrelated changes in one go. It

	<para>Avoid committing style or whitespace fixes and
	  functionality fixes in one go. It makes merging difficult,
	  and also makes it harder to understand just what functional
	  changes were made.  In the case of documentation files, it
	  can make the job of the translation teams more complicated,
	  as it becomes difficult for them to determine exactly what
	  content changes need to be translated.</para>

	<para>Avoid committing changes to multiple files in one go

    <para>If you are working directly on your own code or on code
      which is already well established as your responsibility, then
      there is probably little need to check with other committers
      before jumping in with a commit.  If you see a bug in an area of
      the system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  If, however, you are
      about to modify something which is clearly being actively
      maintained by someone else (and it is only by watching the
      <literal>cvs-committers</literal> mailing list that you can
      really get a feel for just what is and is not) then consider
      sending the change to them instead, just as you would have
      before becoming a committer.  For ports, you should contact the
      listed <makevar>MAINTAINER</makevar> in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For other parts of the
      repository, if you are unsure who the active maintainer might
      be, it may help to scan the output of <command>cvs log</command>
      to see who has committed changes in the past.  &a.fenner; has
      written a nice shell script that can help determine who the
      active maintainer might be.  It lists each person who has
      committed to a given file along with the number of commits each
      person has made.  It can be found on <hostid>freefall</hostid>
      at <filename>~fenner/bin/whodid</filename>.  If your queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      proprietary interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit
      it.</para>

    <para>If you are unsure about a commit for any reason at
      all, have it reviewed by <literal>-hackers</literal>
      before committing.  Better to have it flamed then and there
      rather than when it is part of the CVS repository.  If you do
      happen to commit something which results in controversy
      erupting, you may also wish to consider backing the change out
      again until the matter is settled.  Remember &ndash; with CVS we
      can always change it back.</para>

    <para>Do not impugn the intentions of someone you disagree with.
      If they see a different solution to a problem than you, or even

      destroy your hard work, personal image, or FreeBSD, but simply
      because they have a different outlook on the world.  Different
      is good.</para>

    <para>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</para>

    <para>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</para>

    <para>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of
      the ways open source software is supposed to excel is in the
      number of eyeballs applied to it; this does not apply if nobody
      will review code.</para>

	<para>If you are not already downloading the GNATS tree, add this line

      <step>
	<para>If you do not wish to type your password in every

	  convenience.  If you want to use &man.ssh-agent.1;, make

    </orderedlist>

    <para>As noted, breaking some of these rules can be grounds for
      suspension or, upon repeated offense, permanent removal of
      commit privileges.  Individual members of core
      have the power to temporarily suspend commit privileges until
      core as a whole has the chance to review the
      issue.  In case of an <quote>emergency</quote> (a committer
      doing damage to the repository), a temporary suspension may also
      be done by the repository meisters.
      Only a 2/3 majority of core
      has the authority to suspend commit privileges for longer
      than a week or to remove them permanently.
      This rule does not exist to set core up as a bunch
      of cruel dictators who can dispose of committers as casually as
      empty soda cans, but to give the project a kind of safety fuse.
      If someone is out of control, it is important to be
      able to deal with this immediately rather than be paralyzed by
      debate.  In all cases, a committer whose privileges are
      suspended or revoked is entitled to a <quote>hearing</quote> by core,
      the total duration of the suspension being determined at that
      time.  A committer whose privileges are suspended may also
      request a review of the decision after 30 days and every 30 days
      thereafter (unless the total suspension period is less than 30
      days).  A committer whose privileges have been revoked entirely
      may request a review after a period of 6 months has elapsed.
      This review policy is <emphasis>strictly informal</emphasis>
      and, in all cases, core reserves the right to either act on or
      disregard requests for review if they feel their original
      decision to be the right one.</para>

    <para>In all other aspects of project operation, core is a subset
      of committers and is bound by the <emphasis>same
      rules</emphasis>.  Just because someone is in core this does not mean
      that they have special dispensation to step outside any of
      the lines painted here; core's <quote>special powers</quote>
      only kick in when it acts as a group, not on an individual
      basis.  As individuals, the core team members are all committers
      first and core second.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Details</title>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem id="respect">
	  <para>Respect other committers.</para>

	  <para>This means that you need to treat other committers as
	    the peer-group developers that they are.  Despite our
	    occasional attempts to prove the contrary, one does not get
	    to be a committer by being stupid and nothing rankles more
	    than being treated that way by one of your peers.  Whether
	    we always feel respect for one another or not (and
	    everyone has off days), we still have to
	    <emphasis>treat</emphasis> other committers with respect
	    at all times, on public forums and in private email.</para>

	  <para>Being able to work together long term is this project's
	    greatest asset, one far more important than any set of
	    changes to the code, and turning arguments about code into
	    issues that affect our long-term ability to work
	    harmoniously together is just not worth the trade-off by
	    any conceivable stretch of the imagination.</para>

	  <para>To comply with this rule, do not send email when you are
	    angry or otherwise behave in a manner which is likely to
	    strike others as needlessly confrontational.  First calm
	    down, then think about how to communicate in the most
	    effective fashion for convincing the other person(s) that
	    your side of the argument is correct, do not just blow off
	    some steam so you can feel better in the short term at the
	    cost of a long-term flame war.  Not only is this very bad
	    <quote>energy economics</quote>, but repeated displays of
	    public aggression which impair our ability to work well
	    together will be dealt with severely by the project
	    leadership and may result in suspension or termination of
	    your commit privileges.  The project leadership will
	    take into account both public and private communications
	    brought before it.  It will not seek the disclosure of
	    private communications, but it will take it into account
	    if it is volunteered by the committers involved in the
	    complaint.</para>

	    <para>All of this is never an option which the
	    project's leadership enjoys in the slightest, but unity
	    comes first.  No amount of code or good advice is worth
	    trading that away.</para>

      <title>Policy on Multiple Architectures</title>

      <para>FreeBSD has added several new arch ports during the 5.0
	release cycle and is truly no longer an &i386; centric operating
	system.  In an effort to make it easier to keep FreeBSD portable
	across the platforms we support, core has developed the following
	mandate:</para>

	<blockquote>
	  <para>Our 32 bit reference platform is i386, and our 64 bit
	    reference platform is Sparc64.  Major design work (including
	    major API and ABI changes) must prove itself on at least one
	    32 bit and at least one 64 bit platform, preferably the
	    primary reference platforms, before it may be committed
	    to the source tree.</para>
	</blockquote>

      <para>The i386 and Sparc64 platforms were chosen due to being more
	readily available to developers and as representatives of more
	diverse processor and system designs - big vs little endian,
	register file vs register stack, different DMA and cache
	implementations, hardware page tables vs software TLB management
	etc.</para>

      <para>While the Alpha is a 64 bit processor, it is a more
	traditional processor design and does not provide as good a testbed
	for many of the challenges that the other 64 bit platform ports
	face.  The ia64 platform has many of the same complications that
	Sparc64 has, but is still limited in availability to
	developers.</para>

      <para>We will continue to re-evaluate this policy as cost and
	availability of the 64 bit platforms change.</para>

      <para>Developers should also be aware of our Tier Policy for
	the long term support of hardware architectures.  The rules
	here are intended to provide guidance during the development
	process, and are distinct from the requirements for features
	and architectures listed in that section.  The Tier rules for
	feature support on architectures at release-time are more
	strict than the rules for changes during the development
	process.</para>

      <title>Other Suggestions</title>

      <para>When committing documentation changes, use a spell checker
	before committing.  For all SGML docs, you should also
	verify that your formatting directives are correct by running
	<command>make lint</command>.</para>

      <para>For all on-line manual pages, run <command>manck</command>
	(from ports) over the manual page to verify all of the cross
	references and file references are correct and that the man
	page has all of the appropriate <makevar>MLINK</makevar>s
	installed.</para>

      <para>Do not mix style fixes with new functionality.  A style
	fix is any change which does not modify the functionality of
	the code.  Mixing the changes obfuscates the functionality
	change when using <command>cvs diff</command>, which can hide
	any new bugs.  Do not include whitespace changes with content
	changes in commits to <filename>doc/</filename> or
	<filename>www/</filename>.  The extra clutter in the diffs
	makes the translators' job much more difficult.  Instead, make
	any style or whitespace changes in separate commits that are
	clearly labeled as such in the commit message.</para>

    <title>Support for Multiple Architectures</title>

    <para>FreeBSD is a highly portable operating system intended to
      function on many different types of hardware architectures.
      Maintaining clean separation of Machine Dependent (MD) and Machine
      Independent (MI) code, as well as minimizing MD code, is an important
      part of our strategy to remain agile with regards to current
      hardware trends.  Each new hardware architecture supported by
      FreeBSD adds substantially to the cost of code maintenance,
      toolchain support, and release engineering.  It also dramatically
      increases the cost of effective testing of kernel changes.  As such,
      there is strong motivation to differentiate between classes of
      support for various architectures while remaining strong in a few
      key architectures that are seen as the FreeBSD "target audience".
      </para>

      <title>Statement of General Intent</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD Project targets "production quality commercial
	off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end embedded
	systems".  By retaining a focus on a narrow set of architectures
	of interest in these environments, the FreeBSD Project is able
	to maintain high levels of quality, stability, and performance,
	as well as minimize the load on various support teams on the
	project, such as the ports team, documentation team,
	security officer, and release engineering teams.  Diversity in
	hardware support broadens the options for FreeBSD consumers by
	offering new features and usage opportunities (such as support
	for 64-bit CPUs, use in embedded environments, etc.), but these
	benefits must always be carefully considered in terms of the real-world
	maintenance cost associated with additional platform support.
	</para>

      <para>The FreeBSD Project differentiates platform targets into
	four tiers.  Each tier includes a specification of the
	requirements for an architecture to be in that tier,
	as well as specifying the obligations of developers with
	regards to the platform.  In addition, a policy is defined
	regarding the circumstances required to change the tier

      <para>Tier 2 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  At the discretion of the
	toolchain maintainer, they may be supported in the toolchain.  New
	features added to FreeBSD should be feasible to implement on these
	platforms, but an implementation is not required before the
	feature may be added to the FreeBSD source tree. The
	implementation of a Tier 2 architecture may be committed to the
	main FreeBSD tree as long as it does not interfere with
	production work on Tier 1 platforms, or substantially with other
	Tier 2 platforms.  Before a Tier 2 platform can be added to the
	FreeBSD base source tree, the platform must be able to boot to at
	least single-user mode on real world commodity hardware.  Some
	exceptions to these rules may be made for new hardware that is
	under development by hardware vendors, but not yet available to
	the project.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures are usually systems targeted at Tier 1
	support, but that are still under development.  Architectures

	there are two or fewer active developers, that can not boot to at
	least single-user mode on real hardware (or a simulator for new
	hardware platforms), or which are considered legacy systems
	unlikely to see broad future use.  Tier 3 systems will not be

	  <answer>
	    <para>During the ports freeze, you are not allowed to
	      commit anything to the tree without explicit approval
	      from the ports manager.  <quote>Explicit

	  <answer>
	    <para>The ports manager will send out warning messages to

	      two or three weeks in advance.  The exact starting time
	      will not be determined until a few days before the
	      actual release.  This is because the ports freeze has to
	      be synchronized with the release, and it is usually not
	      known until then when exactly the release will be
	      rolled.</para>

	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>What do I need to do?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The procedure is a strict superset of the one to
	      repocopy individual ports (see above).</para>

	    <para>File a PR in <application>GNATS</application>, listing the
	      reasons for the category request.  Preferably, this should
	      also include patches for <filename>Makefile</filename>s for
	      the old ports, the <filename>Makefile</filename>s for their
	      old categories, and the <makevar>VALID_CATEGORIES</makevar>
	      definition in <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>.
	      Assign the PR to the &a.portmgr; (as <literal>portmgr</literal>).
	      If they approve it, it will be reassigned to &a.cvs; (as
	      <literal>cvs</literal>), who will do a repository copy from
	      the old to the new locations and reassign the PR back to you.
	      Once everything is done, perform the following steps:</para>

	      <procedure>
		<step>
		  <para>Upgrade each copied port's
		    <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Do not connect the
		    new category to the build yet.</para>

		  <para>To do this, you will need to:
		    <procedure>
		      <step>
			<para>Change the port's <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar>
			  (this was the point of the exercise, remember?)
			  The new category should be listed
			  <emphasis>first</emphasis>.  This will help to
			  ensure that the the <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>
			  is correct.</para>
		      </step>

		      <step>
			<para>Run a <command>make describe</command>.  Since
			  the top-level <command>make index</command> that
			  you will be running in a few steps is an iteration
			  of <command>make describe</command> over the entire
			  ports hierarchy, catching any errors here will
			  save you having to re-run that step later on.</para>
		      </step>

		      <step>
			<para>If you want to be really thorough, now might
			  be a good time to run &man.portlint.1;.</para>
		      </step>
		    </procedure>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Check that the <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>s are
		    correct.  The ports system uses each port's
		    <makevar>CATEGORIES</makevar> entry to create
		    its <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>, which is used to
		    connect installed packages to the port directory they
		    were built from. If this entry is wrong, common port
		    tools like &man.pkg.version.1; and
		    &man.portupgrade.1; fail.</para>

		  <para>To do this, use the <filename>chkorigin.sh</filename>
		    tool, as follows: <command>env
		    PORTSDIR=<replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>
		    sh -e <replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>/Tools/scripts/chkorigin.sh
		    </command>.  This will check <emphasis>every</emphasis>
		    port in the ports tree, even those not connected to the
		    build, so you can run it directly after the repocopy.
		    Hint: do not forget to look at the
		    <makevar>PKGORIGIN</makevar>s of any slave ports of the
		    ports you just repocopied!</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>On your own local system, test the proposed
		    changes: first, comment out the
		    <makevar>SUBDIR</makevar> entries in the old
		    ports' categories' <filename>Makefile</filename>s;
		    then enable building the new category in
		    <filename>ports/Makefile</filename>.
		    Run <command>make checksubdirs</command> in the
		    affected category directories to check the
		    <makevar>SUBDIR</makevar> entries.  Next, in
		    the <filename class="directory">ports/</filename>
		    directory, run <command>make index</command>.  This
		    can take over 40 minutes on even modern systems;
		    however, it is a necessary step to prevent problems
		    for other people.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Once this is done, you can commit the
		    updated <filename>ports/Makefile</filename> to
		    connect the new category to the build and also
		    commit the <filename>Makefile</filename> changes
		    for the old category or categories.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Change all the affected module entries in
		    <filename>CVSROOT-ports/modules</filename>.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Add appropriate entries to
		    <filename>ports/MOVED</filename>.</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Update the instructions for &man.cvsup.1; by
		    modifying <filename>distrib/cvsup/sup/README</filename>
		    and adding the following files into

		    <filename>list.cvs</filename> and
		    <filename>releases</filename>.  (Note: these are
		    in the src, not the ports, repository).</para>
		</step>

		<step>
		  <para>Submit a docs PR to add the new category to both the

		  <para>The procedure to update the <ulink

	  <question>
	    <para>How do I know if my port is building correctly or
	      not?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>First, go check
	      <ulink url="http://bento.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/"></ulink>.
	      There you will find error logs from the latest package
	      building runs on all supported platforms for the most
	      recent branches.</para>

	    <para>However, just because the port does not show up there
	      does not mean it is building correctly.  (One of the
	      dependencies may have failed, for instance.)  Here are
	      the relevant directories on <hostid>bento</hostid>, so feel free to dig
	      around.</para>

	    <programlisting> /a/asami/portbuild/&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;major_version&gt;/errors        error logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
		     /logs          all logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
		     /packages      packages from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
		     /bak/errors    error logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
		     /bak/logs      all logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
		     /bak/packages  packages from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>Basically, if the port shows up in
	      <filename>packages</filename>, or it is in
	      <filename>logs</filename> but not in
	      <filename>errors</filename>, it built fine.  (The

	  <answer>
	    <para>When the checksum for a port's distfile is updated due
	      to the author updating the file without changing the port's
	      revision, the commit message should include a summary of
	      the relevant diffs between the original and new distfile to
	      ensure that the distfile has not been corrupted or
	      maliciously altered.  If the current version of the port
	      has been in the ports tree for a while, a copy of the old
	      distfile will usually be available on the ftp servers;
	      otherwise the author or maintainer should be contacted to

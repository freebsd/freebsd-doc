    <para>The &os; repository has a number of components which, when

      documentation, third party application ports infrastructure, and
      various maintained utilities.  When &os; commit bits are
      allocated, the areas of the tree where the bit may be used are
      specified.  Generally, the areas associated with a bit reflect
      who authorized the allocation of the commit bit.  Additional
      areas of authority may be added at a later date: when this
      occurs, the committer should follow normal commit bit allocation
      procedures for that area of the tree, seeking approval from the
      appropriate entity and possibly getting a mentor for that area
      for some period of time.</para>

    <para>Commit bits allocated prior to the development of the notion
      of areas of authority may be appropriate for use in many parts
      of the tree.  However, common sense dictates that a committer
      who has not previously worked in an area of the tree seek review
      prior to committing, seek approval from the appropriate
      responsible party, and/or work with a mentor.  Since the rules
      regarding code maintenance differ by area of the tree, this is
      as much for the benefit of the committer working in an area of
      less familiarity as it is for others working on the tree.</para>

    <para>Committers are encouraged to seek review for their work as
      part of the normal development process, regardless of the area
      of the tree where the work is occurring.</para>

      <para>There are a few ways to obtain a working copy of the tree
	from Subversion.  This section will explain them.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="svn-getting-started-direct-checkout">
	<title>Direct Checkout</title>

	<para>The first is to check out directly from the main
	  repository.  For the <literal>src</literal> tree,
	  use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base/head /usr/src</userinput></screen>

	<para>For the <literal>doc</literal> tree, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/doc/head /usr/doc</userinput></screen>

	<para>For the <literal>ports</literal> tree, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/ports/head /usr/ports</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Though the remaining examples in this document are
	    written with the workflow of working with the
	    <literal>src</literal> tree in mind, the underlying
	    concepts are the same for working with the
	    <literal>doc</literal> and the <literal>ports</literal>
	    tree.
	    Ports related Subversion operations are listed in
	    <xref linkend="ports"/>.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The above command will check out a
	  <literal>CURRENT</literal> source tree as
	  <filename><replaceable>/usr/src/</replaceable></filename>,
	  which can be any target directory on the local filesystem.
	  Omitting the final argument of that command causes the
	  working copy, in this case, to be named <quote>head</quote>,
	  but that can be renamed safely.</para>

	<para><literal>svn+ssh</literal> means the
	  <acronym>SVN</acronym> protocol tunnelled over
	  <acronym>SSH</acronym>.  The name of the server is
	  <literal>repo.freebsd.org</literal>, <literal>base</literal>
	  is the path to the repository, and <literal>head</literal>
	  is the subdirectory within the repository.</para>

	<para>If your &os; login name is different from your login
	  name on your local machine, you must either include it in
	  the <acronym>URL</acronym> (for example
	  <literal>svn+ssh://jarjar@repo.freebsd.org/base/head</literal>),
	  or add an entry to your <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename>
	  in the form:</para>

	<programlisting>Host repo.freebsd.org
	User jarjar</programlisting>

	<para>This is the simplest method, but it is hard to tell just
	  yet how much load it will place on the repository.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <command>svn diff</command> does not require
	    access to the server as <acronym>SVN</acronym> stores a
	    reference copy of every file in the working copy.  This,
	    however, means that Subversion working copies are very
	    large in size.</para>
	</note>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="svn-getting-started-checkout-from-a-mirror">
	<title>Checkout from a Mirror</title>

	<para>Check out a working copy from a mirror by
	  substituting the mirror's <acronym>URL</acronym> for
	  <literal>svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base</literal>.  This can
	  be an official mirror or a mirror maintained by
	  using <command>svnsync</command>.</para>

	<para>There is a serious disadvantage to this method: every
	  time something is to be committed, a
	  <command>svn relocate</command> to the master repository has
	  to be done, remembering to <command>svn relocate</command>
	  back to the mirror after the commit.  Also, since
	  <command>svn relocate</command> only works between
	  repositories that have the same UUID, some hacking of the
	  local repository's UUID has to occur before it is possible
	  to start using it.</para>

	<para>The hassle of a local
	  <command>svnsync</command> mirror probably is not worth it
	  unless the network connectivity situation or other factors
	  demand it.  If it is needed, see the end of this chapter for
	  information on how to set one up.</para>

	<para>At some point, more than just <literal>HEAD</literal>

	<para>To do this, first check out the root of the
	  repository:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout --depth=immediates svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will give <literal>base</literal> with all the

&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=immediates base/release base/releng base/stable</userinput></screen>

	  <literal>stable</literal> branch.</para>

	<para>If at a later date merging to

	  copy:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity base/stable/7</userinput></screen>

	<para>Subtrees do not have to be expanded completely.  For

	  <title>About Merge Tracking</title>

	  <para>From the user's perspective, merge tracking
	    information (or mergeinfo) is stored in a property called
	    <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>, which is a
	    comma-separated list of revisions and ranges of revisions
	    that have been merged.  When set on a file, it applies
	    only to that file.  When set on a directory, it applies to
	    that directory and its descendants (files and directories)
	    except for those that have their own
	    <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>.</para>

	  <para>It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> inherited.  For
	    instance, <filename>stable/6/contrib/openpam/</filename>
	    does not implicitly inherit mergeinfo from
	    <filename>stable/6/</filename>, or
	    <filename>stable/6/contrib/</filename>.
	    Doing so would make partial checkouts very hard to manage.
	    Instead, mergeinfo is explicitly propagated down the tree.
	    For merging something into
	    <filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>,
	    the following rules apply:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If
		<filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>
		does not already have a mergeinfo record, but a direct
		ancestor (for instance,
		<filename>branch/foo/</filename>)

	  <para>Starting with the <literal>stable/10</literal>

	    merged to and committed from the root of the
	    branch.  All merges should look like:</para>

	  <title>Selecting the Source and Target for

	  <para>For <literal>stable/9</literal> and earlier,
	    a different strategy was used, distributing mergeinfo
	    around the tree so that merges could be performed without
	    a complete checkout.  This procedure proved extremely
	    error-prone, with the convenience of partial checkouts for
	    merges significantly outweighed by the complexity of
	    picking mergeinfo targets.  The below describes this

	    <emphasis>only for merges prior to
	      <literal>stable/10</literal></emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>Because of mergeinfo propagation, it is important to

		<filename>sys/dev/ichwd/</filename>.  Likewise, a
		change to the TCP/IP stack should be merged to

		<filename>sys/netinet/</filename>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to code under <filename>etc/</filename>
		should be merged at <filename>etc/</filename>, not

	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to vendor code (code in

		<filename>crypto/</filename> and so on) should be
		merged to the directory where vendor imports happen.
		For instance, a change to
		<filename>crypto/openssl/util/</filename> should be
		merged to <filename>crypto/openssl/</filename>.  This
		is rarely an issue, however, since changes to vendor
		code are usually merged wholesale.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to userland programs should as a general
		rule be merged to the directory that contains the

		<filename>usr.bin/xlint/</filename>.</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to userland libraries should as a general
		rule be merged to the directory that contains the

	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>There may be cases where it makes sense to deviate

		library itself and all of the modules each have their
		own Makefile.</para>

	  <para>If you need to merge changes to several places at once
	    (for instance, changing a kernel interface and every
	    userland program that uses it), merge each target
	    separately, then commit them together.  For instance, if
	    you merge a revision that changed a kernel
	    <acronym>API</acronym> and updated all the userland bits
	    that used that <acronym>API</acronym>, you would merge the
	    kernel change to sys, and the userland bits to the
	    appropriate userland directories, then commit all of these
	    in one go.</para>

	  <para>The source will almost invariably be the same as the
	    target.  For instance, you will always merge
	    <filename>stable/7/lib/libc/</filename> from
	    <filename>head/lib/libc/</filename>.  The only exception
	    would be when merging changes to code that has moved in
	    the source branch but not in the parent branch.  For
	    instance, a change to &man.pkill.1; would be merged from
	    <filename>bin/pkill/</filename> in head to
	    <filename>usr.bin/pkill/</filename> in stable/7.</para>

	  <title>Preparing the Merge Target</title>

	  <para>Because of the mergeinfo propagation issues described
	    earlier, it is very important that you never merge changes
	    into a sparse working copy.  You must always have a full
	    checkout of the branch you will merge into.  For instance,
	    when merging from HEAD to 7, you must have a full checkout
	    of stable/7:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd stable/7</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity</userinput></screen>

	  <title>Identifying Revisions</title>

	      an up-to-date working copy of stable/&dollar;B, the

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R $target</userinput>
$target - /head/$source:$P,$Q</screen>

	    <para>Merging is done like so:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge -c$R $FSVN/head/$source $target</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Checking the results of this is possible with
	      <command>svn diff</command>.</para>

	    <para>The svn:mergeinfo now looks like:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R $target</userinput>
$target - head/$source:$P,$Q,$R</screen>

	    <para>If the results are not exactly as shown, assistance
	      may be required before committing as mistakes may have
	      been made, or there may be something wrong with the

	      Subversion.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Practical Example</title>

	    <para>As a practical example, consider the following
	      scenario.  The changes to <filename>netmap.4</filename>
	      in r238987 are to be merged from CURRENT to 9-STABLE.
	      The file resides in
	      <filename>head/share/man/man4</filename>.  According
	      to <xref linkend="svn-advanced-use-merging"/>, this is
	      also where to do the merge.  Note that in this example
	      all paths are relative to the top of the svn repository.
	      For more information on the directory layout, see <xref
		linkend="svn-getting-started-base-layout"/>.</para>

	    <para>The first step is to inspect the existing
	      mergeinfo.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Take a quick note of how it looks before moving on
	      to the next step; doing the actual merge:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge -c r238987 svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base/head/share/man/man4 stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput>
--- Merging r238987 into 'stable/9/share/man/man4':
U    stable/9/share/man/man4/netmap.4
--- Recording mergeinfo for merge of r238987 into
'stable/9/share/man/man4':
 U   stable/9/share/man/man4</screen>

	    <para>Check that the revision number of the merged
	      revision has been added.  Once this is verified, the
	      only thing left is the actual commit.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Merging into the Kernel
	      (<filename>sys/</filename>)</title>

	    <para>As stated above, merging into the kernel is
	      different from merging in the rest of the tree.  In many
	      ways merging to the kernel is simpler because there is
	      always the same merge target
	      (<filename>sys/</filename>).</para>

	    <para>Once <command>svn merge</command> has been executed,
	      <command>svn diff</command> has to be run on the
	      directory to check the changes.  This may show some
	      unrelated property changes, but these can be ignored.
	      Next, build and test the kernel, and, once the tests are
	      complete, commit the code as normal, making sure that
	      the commit message starts with <quote>Merge
		<replaceable>r226222</replaceable> from head</quote>,
	      or similar.</para>

	  <title>Precautions Before Committing</title>

	  <para>As always, build world (or appropriate parts of
	    it).</para>

	  <para>Check the changes with <command>svn diff</command> and
	    <command>svn stat</command>.  Make sure all the files that
	    should have been added or deleted were in fact added or
	    deleted.</para>

	  <para>Take a closer look at any property change (marked by a
	    <literal>M</literal> in the second column of <command>svn
	      stat</command>).  Normally, no svn:mergeinfo properties
	    should be anywhere except the target directory (or
	    directories).</para>

	  <para>If something looks fishy, ask for help.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Committing</title>

	  <para>Make sure to commit a top level directory to have the

	  <title>Preparing the Tree</title>

	  <para>If importing for the first time after the switch to
	    Subversion, flattening and cleaning up the vendor tree is
	    necessary, as well as bootstrapping the merge history in
	    the main tree.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Flattening</title>

	    <para>During the conversion from <acronym>CVS</acronym> to
	      Subversion, vendor branches were imported with the same
	      layout as the main tree.  This means that the
	      <literal>pf</literal> vendor sources ended up in
	      <filename>vendor/pf/dist/contrib/pf</filename>.  The
	      vendor source is best directly in
	      <filename>vendor/pf/dist</filename>.</para>

	    <para>To flatten the <literal>pf</literal> tree:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>vendor/pf/dist/contrib/pf</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn mv $(svn list) ../..</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ../..</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn rm contrib</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propdel -R svn:mergeinfo .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	    <para>The <literal>propdel</literal> bit is necessary
	      because starting with 1.5, Subversion will automatically
	      add <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> to any directory
	      that is copied or moved.  In this case, as nothing is
	      being merged from the deleted tree, they just get in the
	      way.</para>

	    <para>Tags may be flattened as well (3, 4, 3.5 etc.); the
	      procedure is exactly the same, only changing
	      <literal>dist</literal> to <literal>3.5</literal> or
	      similar, and putting the <command>svn commit</command>
	      off until the end of the process.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Cleaning Up</title>

	    <para>The <literal>dist</literal> tree can be cleaned up
	      as necessary.  Disabling keyword expansion is
	      recommended, as it makes no sense on unmodified vendor
	      code and in some cases it can even be harmful.
	      <application>OpenSSH</application>, for example,
	      includes two files that originated with &os; and still
	      contain the original version tags.  To do this:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propdel svn:keywords -R .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Bootstrapping Merge History</title>

	    <para>If importing for the first time after the switch to
	      Subversion, bootstrap <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>
	      on the target directory in the main tree to the revision
	      that corresponds to the last related change to the
	      vendor tree, prior to importing new sources:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>head/contrib/pf</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge --record-only svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base/<replaceable>vendor/pf/dist@180876</replaceable> .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Importing New Sources</title>

	  <para>With two commits&mdash;one for the import itself and
	    one for the tag&mdash;this step can optionally be repeated
	    for every upstream release between the last import and the
	    current import.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Preparing the Vendor Sources</title>

	    <para>Unlike in <acronym>CVS</acronym> where only the
	      needed parts were imported into the vendor tree to avoid
	      bloating the main tree, Subversion is able to store a
	      full distribution in the vendor tree.  So, import
	      everything, but merge only what is required.</para>

	    <para>A <command>svn add</command> is required to add any
	      files that were added since the last vendor import, and
	      <command>svn rm</command> is required to remove any that
	      were removed since.  Preparing sorted lists of the
	      contents of the vendor tree and of the sources that are
	      about to be imported is recommended, to facilitate the
	      process.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>vendor/pf/dist</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn list -R | grep -v '/$' | sort &gt;../old</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>../pf-4.3</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>find . -type f | cut -c 3- | sort &gt;../new</userinput></screen>

	    <para>With these two files,
	      <command>comm -23 ../old ../new</command> will list
	      removed files (files only in <filename>old</filename>),
	      while <command>comm -13 ../old ../new</command> will
	      list added files only in
	      <filename>new</filename>.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Importing into the Vendor Tree</title>

	    <para>Now, the sources must be copied into
	      <filename><replaceable>dist</replaceable></filename> and
	      the <command>svn add</command> and
	      <command>svn rm</command> commands should be used as
	      needed:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>vendor/pf/pf-4.3</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>tar cf - . | tar xf - -C ../dist</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>../dist</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>comm -23 ../old ../new | xargs svn rm</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>comm -13 ../old ../new | xargs svn --parents add</userinput></screen>

	    <para>If any directories were removed, they will have to
	      be <command>svn rm</command>ed manually.  Nothing will
	      break if they are not, but they will remain in the
	      tree.</para>

	    <para>Check properties on any new files.  All text files
	      should have <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to
	      <literal>native</literal>.  All binary files should have
	      <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> set to
	      <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> unless there
	      is a more appropriate media type.  Executable files
	      should have <literal>svn:executable</literal> set to
	      <literal>*</literal>.  No other properties should exist
	      on any file in the tree.</para>

	    <para>Committing is now possible, however it is good
	      practice to make sure that everything is OK by using the
	      <command>svn stat</command> and
	      <command>svn diff</command> commands.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Tagging</title>

	    <para>Once committed, vendor releases should be tagged for
	      future reference.  The best and quickest way to do this
	      is directly in the repository:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base/<replaceable>vendor/pf/dist</replaceable> svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/base/<replaceable>vendor/pf/4.3</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	    <para>First, prepare the directory in

	      Once the files are in place, <command>svn add</command>
	      the new ones, then <command>svn commit</command> and tag

&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	</note>

	<para>Reverting the deletion of a file is slightly different.
	  Copying the version of the file that predates the deletion
	  is required.  For example, to restore a file that was

	<para>You probably do not want to do this unless there is a

    <para>The &os; project strongly discourages the so-called
      "advertising clause" in new code.  Due to the large number of
      contributors to the &os; project, complying with this clause for
      many commercial vendors has become difficult.  If you have code
      in the tree with the advertising clause, please consider
      removing it.  In fact, please consider using the above license
      for your code.</para>

    <para>The &os; project discourages completely new licenses and
      variations on the standard licenses.  New licenses require the
      approval of the &a.core; to reside in the
      main repository.  The more different licenses that are used in
      the tree, the more problems that this causes to those wishing to
      utilize this code, typically from unintended consequences from a
      poorly worded license.</para>

    <para>Project policy dictates that code under some non-BSD
      licenses must be placed only in specific sections of the
      repository, and in some cases, compilation must be conditional
      or even disabled by default.  For example, the GENERIC kernel
      must be compiled under only licenses identical to or
      substantially similar to the BSD license.  GPL, APSL, CDDL, etc,
      licensed software must not be compiled into GENERIC.</para>

    <para>Developers are reminded that in open source, getting "open"
      right is just as important as getting "source" right, as
      improper handling of intellectual property has serious
      consequences.  Any questions or concerns should immediately be
      brought to the attention of the core team.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="tracking.license.grants">
    <title>Keeping Track of Licenses Granted to the &os;
      Project</title>

    <para>Various software or data exist in the repositories where
      the &os; project has been granted a special licence to be able
      to use them.  A case in point are the Terminus fonts for use
      with &man.vt.4;.  Here the author Dimitar Zhekov has allowed us
      to use the "Terminus BSD Console" font under a 2-clause BSD
      license rather than the regular Open Font License he normally
      uses.</para>

    <para>It is clearly sensible to keep a record of any such
      license grants.  To that end, the &a.core; has decided to keep
      an archive of them.  Whenever the &os; project is granted a
      special license we require the &a.core; to be notified.  Any
      developers involved in arranging such a license grant, please
      send details to the &a.core; including:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Contact details for people or organizations granting the
	  special license.</para>

      serve as our permanent record of the license grant.</para>

      archive will be available on request to the &a.core;.</para>

    <title>Developer Relations</title>

    <para>If you are working directly on your own code or on code
      which is already well established as your responsibility, then
      there is probably little need to check with other committers
      before jumping in with a commit.  If you see a bug in an area of
      the system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  If, however, you are
      about to modify something which is clearly being actively
      maintained by someone else (and it is only by watching the
      <literal><replaceable>repository</replaceable>-committers</literal>
      mailing list that you can really get a feel for just what is and
      is not) then consider sending the change to them instead, just
      as you would have before becoming a committer.  For ports, you
      should contact the listed <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For other parts of the
      repository, if you are unsure who the active maintainer might
      be, it may help to scan the revision history to see who has
      committed changes in the past.  An example script that lists
      each person who has committed to
      a given file along with the number of commits each person has
      made can be found at on <systemitem>freefall</systemitem> at
      <filename>~eadler/bin/whodid</filename>.  If your queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit it.</para>

      <para>Avoid sending private emails to maintainers.  Other people
	might be interested in the conversation, not just the final

    <para>If you are unsure about a commit for any reason at all, have
      it reviewed by <literal>-hackers</literal> before committing.
      Better to have it flamed then and there rather than when it is
      part of the repository.  If you do happen to commit something
      which results in controversy erupting, you may also wish to
      consider backing the change out again until the matter is
      settled.  Remember &ndash; with a version control system we can
      always change it back.</para>

    <para>Do not impugn the intentions of someone you disagree with.
      If they see a different solution to a problem than you, or even
      a different problem, it is not because they are stupid, because
      they have questionable parentage, or because they are trying to
      destroy your hard work, personal image, or &os;, but simply
      because they have a different outlook on the world.  Different
      is good.</para>

    <para>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</para>

    <para>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</para>

    <para>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of

    <para>As noted, breaking some of these rules can be grounds for
      suspension or, upon repeated offense, permanent removal of
      commit privileges.  Individual members of core have the power to
      temporarily suspend commit privileges until core as a whole has
      the chance to review the issue.  In case of an
      <quote>emergency</quote> (a committer doing damage to the
      repository), a temporary suspension may also be done by the
      repository meisters.  Only a 2/3 majority of core has the
      authority to suspend commit privileges for longer than a week or
      to remove them permanently.  This rule does not exist to set
      core up as a bunch of cruel dictators who can dispose of
      committers as casually as empty soda cans, but to give the
      project a kind of safety fuse.  If someone is out of control, it
      is important to be able to deal with this immediately rather
      than be paralyzed by debate.  In all cases, a committer whose
      privileges are suspended or revoked is entitled to a
      <quote>hearing</quote> by core, the total duration of the
      suspension being determined at that time.  A committer whose
      privileges are suspended may also request a review of the
      decision after 30 days and every 30 days thereafter (unless the
      total suspension period is less than 30 days).  A committer
      whose privileges have been revoked entirely may request a review
      after a period of 6 months has elapsed.  This review policy is
      <emphasis>strictly informal</emphasis> and, in all cases, core
      reserves the right to either act on or disregard requests for
      review if they feel their original decision to be the right
      one.</para>

    <para>In all other aspects of project operation, core is a subset
      of committers and is bound by the
      <emphasis>same rules</emphasis>.  Just because someone is in
      core this does not mean that they have special dispensation to
      step outside any of the lines painted here; core's
      <quote>special powers</quote> only kick in when it acts as a
      group, not on an individual basis.  As individuals, the core
      team members are all committers first and core second.</para>

	  <para>Respect other committers.</para>

	  <para>This means that you need to treat other committers as
	    the peer-group developers that they are.  Despite our
	    occasional attempts to prove the contrary, one does not
	    get to be a committer by being stupid and nothing rankles
	    more than being treated that way by one of your peers.
	    Whether we always feel respect for one another or not (and
	    everyone has off days), we still have to
	    <emphasis>treat</emphasis> other committers with respect
	    at all times, on public forums and in private
	    email.</para>

	  <para>Being able to work together long term is this
	    project's greatest asset, one far more important than any
	    set of changes to the code, and turning arguments about
	    code into issues that affect our long-term ability to work
	    harmoniously together is just not worth the trade-off by
	    any conceivable stretch of the imagination.</para>

	  <para>To comply with this rule, do not send email when you
	    are angry or otherwise behave in a manner which is likely
	    to strike others as needlessly confrontational.  First
	    calm down, then think about how to communicate in the most
	    effective fashion for convincing the other person(s) that
	    your side of the argument is correct, do not just blow off
	    some steam so you can feel better in the short term at the
	    cost of a long-term flame war.  Not only is this very bad
	    <quote>energy economics</quote>, but repeated displays of
	    public aggression which impair our ability to work well
	    together will be dealt with severely by the project
	    leadership and may result in suspension or termination of
	    your commit privileges.  The project leadership will take
	    into account both public and private communications
	    brought before it.  It will not seek the disclosure of
	    private communications, but it will take it into account
	    if it is volunteered by the committers involved in the
	    complaint.</para>

	  <para>All of this is never an option which the project's
	    leadership enjoys in the slightest, but unity comes first.

	  <para>The repository is not where changes should be

	    should happen first in the mailing lists or by use of the
	    Phabricator service and the commit should only happen once
	    something resembling consensus has been reached.  This
	    does not mean that you have to ask permission before
	    correcting every obvious syntax error or manual page
	    misspelling, simply that you should try to develop a feel
	    for when a proposed change is not quite such a no-brainer
	    and requires some feedback first.  People really do not
	    mind sweeping changes if the result is something clearly
	    better than what they had before, they just do not like
	    being <emphasis>surprised</emphasis> by those changes.
	    The very best way of making sure that you are on the right

	    for documentation on this.  Where sections of code have

	    maintainer need to be reviewed by at least one other
	    maintainer.  In cases where the
	    <quote>maintainer-ship</quote> of something is not clear,

	  <para>This may be hard to swallow in times of conflict (when
	    each side is convinced that they are in the right, of
	    course) but a version control system makes it unnecessary
	    to have an ongoing dispute raging when it is far easier to
	    simply reverse the disputed change, get everyone calmed
	    down again and then try to figure out what is the best way
	    to proceed.  If the change turns out to be the best thing
	    after all, it can be easily brought back.  If it turns out
	    not to be, then the users did not have to live with the
	    bogus change in the tree while everyone was busily
	    debating its merits.  People <emphasis>very</emphasis>
	    rarely call for back-outs in the repository since
	    discussion generally exposes bad or controversial changes
	    before the commit even happens, but on such rare occasions
	    the back-out should be done without argument so that we

	  <para>This is another <quote>do not argue about it</quote>
	    issue since it is the release engineer who is ultimately

	    be bad.  Please respect this and give the release engineer
	    your full cooperation when it comes to the &os.stable;
	    branch.  The management of &os.stable; may frequently seem
	    to be overly conservative to the casual observer, but also
	    bear in mind the fact that conservatism is supposed to be
	    the hallmark of &os.stable; and different rules apply
	    there than in &os.current;.  There is also really no point
	    in having &os.current; be a testing ground if changes are

	  <para>Do not fight in public with other committers; it looks
	    bad.</para>

	  <para>This project has a public image to uphold and that
	    image is very important to all of us, especially if we are
	    to continue to attract new members.  There will be
	    occasions when, despite everyone's very best attempts at
	    self-control, tempers are lost and angry words are
	    exchanged.  The best thing that can be done in such cases
	    is to minimize the effects of this until everyone has
	    cooled back down.  That means that you should not air your
	    angry words in public and you should not forward private
	    correspondence or other private communications to public
	    mailing lists, mail aliases, instant messaging channels or
	    social media sites.  What people say one-to-one is often
	    much less sugar-coated than what they would say in public,
	    and such communications therefore have no place there -
	    they only serve to inflame an already bad situation.  If
	    the person sending you a flame-o-gram at least had the
	    grace to send it privately, then have the grace to keep it
	    private yourself.  If you feel you are being unfairly
	    treated by another developer, and it is causing you
	    anguish, bring the matter up with core rather than taking
	    it public.  Core will do its best to play peace makers and
	    get things back to sanity.  In cases where the dispute
	    involves a change to the codebase and the participants do
	    not appear to be reaching an amicable agreement, core may
	    appoint a mutually-agreeable third party to resolve the
	    dispute.  All parties involved must then agree to be bound
	    by the decision reached by this third party.</para>

      <title>Policy on Multiple Architectures</title>

      <para>&os; has added several new architecture ports during
	recent release cycles and is truly no longer an &i386; centric
	operating system.  In an effort to make it easier to keep
	&os; portable across the platforms we support, core has
	developed the following mandate:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<para>Our 32-bit reference platform is &arch.i386;, and our
	  64-bit reference platform is &arch.sparc64;.  Major design
	  work (including major API and ABI changes) must prove
	  itself on at least one 32-bit and at least one 64-bit
	  platform, preferably the primary reference platforms,
	  before it may be committed to the source tree.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>The &arch.i386; and &arch.sparc64; platforms were chosen
	due to being more readily available to developers and as
	representatives of more diverse processor and system designs -
	big versus little endian, register file versus register stack,
	different DMA and cache implementations, hardware page tables
	versus software TLB management etc.</para>

      <para>The &arch.ia64; platform has many of the same
	complications that &arch.sparc64; has, but is still limited in
	availability to developers.</para>

      <para>We will continue to re-evaluate this policy as cost and
	availability of the 64-bit platforms change.</para>

      <para>Developers should also be aware of our Tier Policy for
	the long term support of hardware architectures.  The rules
	here are intended to provide guidance during the development
	process, and are distinct from the requirements for features
	and architectures listed in that section.  The Tier rules for
	feature support on architectures at release-time are more
	strict than the rules for changes during the development
	process.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Other Suggestions</title>

      <para>When committing documentation changes, use a spell checker
	before committing.  For all XML docs, verify that the
	formatting directives are correct by running
	<command>make lint</command> and
	<package>textproc/igor</package>.</para>

      <para>For manual pages, run <package>sysutils/manck</package>
	and <package>textproc/igor</package>
	over the manual page to verify all of the cross
	references and file references are correct and that the man
	page has all of the appropriate <varname>MLINK</varname>s
	installed.</para>

      <para>Do not mix style fixes with new functionality.  A style
	fix is any change which does not modify the functionality of
	the code.  Mixing the changes obfuscates the functionality
	change when asking for differences between revisions, which
	can hide any new bugs.  Do not include whitespace changes with
	content changes in commits to <filename>doc/</filename> .
	The extra clutter in the diffs
	makes the translators' job much more difficult.  Instead, make
	any style or whitespace changes in separate commits that are

    <title>Support for Multiple Architectures</title>

    <para>&os; is a highly portable operating system intended to
      function on many different types of hardware architectures.
      Maintaining clean separation of Machine Dependent (MD) and
      Machine Independent (MI) code, as well as minimizing MD code, is
      an important part of our strategy to remain agile with regards
      to current hardware trends.  Each new hardware architecture
      supported by &os; adds substantially to the cost of code
      maintenance, toolchain support, and release engineering.  It
      also dramatically increases the cost of effective testing of
      kernel changes.  As such, there is strong motivation to
      differentiate between classes of support for various
      architectures while remaining strong in a few key architectures
      that are seen as the &os; <quote>target audience</quote>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Statement of General Intent</title>

      <para>The &os; Project targets "production quality commercial
	off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end
	embedded systems".  By retaining a focus on a narrow set of
	architectures of interest in these environments, the &os;
	Project is able to maintain high levels of quality, stability,
	and performance, as well as minimize the load on various
	support teams on the project, such as the ports team,
	documentation team, security officer, and release engineering
	teams.  Diversity in hardware support broadens the options for
	&os; consumers by offering new features and usage
	opportunities (such as support for 64-bit CPUs, use in
	embedded environments, etc.), but these benefits must always
	be carefully considered in terms of the real-world maintenance
	cost associated with additional platform support.</para>

      <para>The &os; Project differentiates platform targets into
	four tiers.  Each tier includes a specification of the
	requirements for an architecture to be in that tier,
	as well as specifying the obligations of developers with
	regards to the platform.  In addition, a policy is defined
	regarding the circumstances required to change the tier
	of an architecture.</para>

      <title>Tier 1: Fully Supported Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 1 platforms are fully supported by the security
	officer, release engineering, and toolchain maintenance staff.
	New features added to the operating system must be fully
	functional across all Tier 1 architectures for every release
	(features which are inherently architecture-specific, such as
	support for hardware device drivers, may be exempt from this
	requirement).  In general, all Tier 1 platforms must have
	build and Tinderbox support either in the FreeBSD.org cluster,
	or be easily available for all developers.  Embedded platforms
	may substitute an emulator available in the &os; cluster
	for actual hardware.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be Production Quality
	with respects to all aspects of the &os; operating system,
	including installation and development environments.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be completely
	integrated into the source tree and have all features
	necessary to produce an entire system relevant for that target
	architecture.  Tier 1 architectures generally have at least 6
	active developers.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be fully supported by
	the ports system.  All the ports should build on a Tier 1
	platform, or have the appropriate filters to prevent the
	inappropriate ones from building there.  The packaging system
	must support all Tier 1 architectures.  To ensure an
	architecture's Tier 1 status, proponents of that architecture
	must show that all relevant packages can be built on that
	platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 embedded architectures must be able to cross-build
	packages on at least one other Tier 1 architecture.  The
	packages must be the most relevant for the platform, but may
	be a non-empty subset of those that build natively.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures must be fully documented.  All basic
	operations need to be covered by the handbook or other
	documents.  All relevant integration documentation must also
	be integrated into the tree, or readily available.</para>

      <title>Tier 2: Developmental Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 2 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  Platform maintainers are
	responsible for toolchain support in the tree.  The toolchain
	maintainers are expected to work with the platform maintainers
	to refine these changes.  Major new toolchain components are
	allowed to break support for Tier 2 architectures if the
	&os;-local changes have not been incorporated upstream.
	The toolchain maintainers are expected to provide prompt
	review of any proposed changes and cannot block, through their
	inaction, changes going into the tree.  New features added to
	&os; should be feasible to implement on these platforms,
	but an implementation is not required before the feature may
	be added to the &os; source tree.  New features that may be
	difficult to implement on Tier 2 architectures should provide
	a means of disabling them on those architectures.  The
	implementation of a Tier 2 architecture may be committed to
	the main &os; tree as long as it does not interfere with
	production work on Tier 1 platforms, or substantially with
	other Tier 2 platforms.  Before a Tier 2 platform can be added
	to the &os; base source tree, the platform must be able to
	boot multi-user on actual hardware.  Generally, there must be
	at least three active developers working on the
	platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures are usually systems targeted at Tier
	1 support, but that are still under development.
	Architectures reaching end of life may also be moved from Tier
	1 status to Tier 2 status as the availability of resources to
	continue to maintain the system in a Production Quality state
	diminishes.  Well supported niche architectures may also be
	Tier 2.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures have basic support for them
	integrated into the ports infrastructure.  They may have cross
	compilation support added, at the discretion of portmgr.  Some
	ports must built natively into packages if the package system
	supports that architecture.  If not integrated into the base
	system, some external patches for the architecture for ports
	must be available.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures can be integrated into the &os;
	handbook.  The basics for how to get a system running must be
	documented, although not necessarily for every single board or
	system a Tier 2 architecture supports.  The supported hardware
	list must exist and should be relatively recent.  It should be
	integrated into the &os; documentation.</para>

      <para>Current Tier 2 platforms are &arch.arm;, &arch.ia64;

      <para>Tier 3 platforms are not supported by the security officer

	Tier 3 platforms are architectures in the early stages of
	development, for non-mainstream hardware platforms, or which
	are considered legacy systems unlikely to see broad future
	use.  Initial support for Tier 3 platforms should be worked on
	in external SCM repositories.
	The transition to &os;'s subversion should take place after
	the platform boots multi-user on hardware; sharing via
	subversion is needed for wider exposure; and multiple
	developers are actively working on the platform.
	Platforms that transition to Tier 3 status may be
	removed from the tree if they are no longer actively supported
	by the &os; developer community at the discretion of the
	release engineer.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms may have ports support, either integrated
	or external, but do not require it.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms must have the basics documented for how

	  <answer>
	    <para>This is essentially the reverse of deleting a

	    <important>
	      <para>Do not use <command>svn add</command> to add the

		<command>svn add</command> the port.</para>

	    <procedure>
	      <step>
		<para>Figure out when the port was removed.  Use this
		  <link
		    xlink:href="http://people.freebsd.org/~crees/removed_ports/index.xml">list</link>,
		  or look for the port on <link
		    xlink:href="http://www.freshports.org/">freshports</link>,
		  and then copy the last living revision of the
		  port:</para>

		<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/<replaceable>category</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp 'svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/ports/head/<replaceable>category</replaceable>/<replaceable>portname</replaceable>/@<replaceable>XXXXXX</replaceable>' <replaceable>portname</replaceable></userinput></screen>

		<para>Pick the revision that is just before the
		  removal.  For example, if the revision where it was
		  removed is <literal>269874</literal>, use
		  <literal>269873</literal>.</para>

		<para>It is also possible to specify a date.  In that
		  case, pick a date that is before the removal but
		  after the last commit to the port.</para>

&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp 'svn+ssh://repo.freebsd.org/ports/head/<replaceable>category</replaceable>/<replaceable>portname</replaceable>/@{<replaceable>YYYY-MM-DD</replaceable>}' <replaceable>portname</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <question>
	    <para>When do we need a repository copy?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When you want to add a port that is related to any
	      port that is already in the tree in a separate
	      directory, you have to do a repository copy.  Here
	      <wordasword>related</wordasword> means it is a different
	      version or a slightly modified version.  Examples are
	      <filename>print/ghostscript*</filename> (different
	      versions) and <filename>x11-wm/windowmaker*</filename>
	      (English-only and internationalized version).</para>

	    <para>Another example is when a port is moved from one
	      subdirectory to another, or when you want to change the
	      name of a directory because the author(s) renamed their
	      software even though it is a descendant of a port
	      already in a tree.</para>

	  <answer>
	    <procedure>
	      <step>
		<para>Upgrade each moved port's
		  <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Do not connect the
		  new category to the build yet.</para>

		<para>To do this, you will need to:</para>

		<procedure>
		  <step>
		    <para>Change the port's
		      <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> (this was the
		      point of the exercise, remember?)  The new
		      category should be listed
		      <emphasis>first</emphasis>.  This will help to
		      ensure that the <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname> is
		      correct.</para>
		  </step>

		  <step>
		    <para>Run a <command>make describe</command>.
		      Since the top-level
		      <command>make index</command> that you will be
		      running in a few steps is an iteration of
		      <command>make describe</command> over the entire
		      ports hierarchy, catching any errors here will
		      save you having to re-run that step later
		      on.</para>
		  </step>

		  <step>
		    <para>If you want to be really thorough, now
		      might be a good time to run
		      &man.portlint.1;.</para>
		  </step>
		</procedure>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>Check that the <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>s are
		  correct.  The ports system uses each port's
		  <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> entry to create its
		  <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>, which is used to
		  connect installed packages to the port directory
		  they were built from.  If this entry is wrong,
		  common port tools like &man.pkg.version.1; and
		  &man.portupgrade.1; fail.</para>

		<para>To do this, use the
		  <filename>chkorigin.sh</filename> tool, as follows:
		  <command>env
		  PORTSDIR=<replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>
		  sh -e
		  <replaceable>/path/to/ports</replaceable>/Tools/scripts/chkorigin.sh</command>.
		  This will check <emphasis>every</emphasis> port in
		  the ports tree, even those not connected to the
		  build, so you can run it directly after the move
		  operation.  Hint: do not forget to look at the
		  <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>s of any slave ports of
		  the ports you just moved!</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>On your own local system, test the proposed
		  changes: first, comment out the
		  <varname>SUBDIR</varname> entries in the old ports'
		  categories' <filename>Makefile</filename>s; then
		  enable building the new category in
		  <filename>ports/Makefile</filename>.  Run
		  <command>make checksubdirs</command> in the affected
		  category directories to check the
		  <varname>SUBDIR</varname> entries.  Next, in the
		  <filename>ports/</filename>
		  directory, run <command>make index</command>.  This
		  can take over 40 minutes on even modern systems;
		  however, it is a necessary step to prevent problems

	      <step>
		<para>Once this is done, you can commit the updated

		<para>(Note: these are in the docs, not the ports,

		  will need to submit a PR for this.</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>

Do you want to commit? (no = start a shell) [y/n]</screen>

	    <para>At that point, the script will either open a shell
	      for you to fix things, or open your text editor with the
	      commit message all prepared and then commit the
	      merge.</para>

	    <para>The script assumes that you can connect to
	      <literal>repo.FreeBSD.org</literal> with
	      <application>SSH</application> directly, so if your
	      local login name is different than your &os; cluster

      these developers as well (except things specific to commits and
      the mailing list memberships that go with them).  In particular,

    <title>Information About &ga;</title>

    <para>As of December 12, 2012, &ga; was enabled on the
      &os;&nbsp;Project website to collect anonymized usage statistics
      regarding usage of the site.  The information collected is
      valuable to the &os;&nbsp;Documentation Project, in order to
      identify various problems on the &os; website.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="google-analytics-policy">
      <title>&ga; General Policy</title>

      <para>The &os;&nbsp;Project takes visitor privacy very
	seriously.  As such, the &os;&nbsp;Project website honors the
	<quote>Do Not Track</quote> header <emphasis>before</emphasis>
	fetching the tracking code from Google.  For more information,
	please see the
	<link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/privacy.html">&os;
	  Privacy Policy</link>.</para>

      <para>&ga; access is <emphasis>not</emphasis> arbitrarily
	allowed &mdash; access must be requested, voted on by the
	&a.doceng;, and explicitly granted.</para>

      <para>Requests for &ga; data must include a specific purpose.
	For example, a valid reason for requesting access would be
	<quote>to see the most frequently used web browsers when
	  viewing &os; web pages to ensure page rendering speeds are
	  acceptable.</quote></para>

      <para>Conversely, <quote>to see what web browsers are most
	  frequently used</quote> (without stating
	<emphasis>why</emphasis>) would be rejected.</para>

      <para>All requests must include the timeframe for which the data
	would be required.  For example, it must be explicitly stated
	if the requested data would be needed for a timeframe covering
	a span of 3 weeks, or if the request would be one-time
	only.</para>

      <para>Any request for &ga; data without a clear, reasonable
	reason beneficial to the &os;&nbsp;Project will be
	rejected.</para>

	<question>
	  <para>Why are trivial or cosmetic changes to files on a
	    vendor branch a bad idea?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>From now on, every new vendor release of that file
		will need to have patches merged in by hand.</para>
	    </listitem>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>How do I add a new file to a branch?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>To add a file onto a branch, simply checkout or update
	    to the branch you want to add to and then add the file
	    using the add operation as you normally would.  This works
	    fine for the <literal>doc</literal> and
	    <literal>ports</literal> trees.  The
	    <literal>src</literal> tree uses SVN and requires more
	    care because of the <literal>mergeinfo</literal>
	    properties.  See the
	    <link linkend="subversion-primer">Subversion Primer</link>
	    for details on how to perform an MFC.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>How do I access <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">people.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> to
	    put up personal or project information?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">people.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> is
	    the same as <systemitem
	      class="fqdomainname">freefall.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>.
	    Just create a <filename>public_html</filename> directory.
	    Anything you place in that directory will automatically be
	    visible under <uri
	      xlink:href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/">http://people.FreeBSD.org/</uri>.</para>

	<question>
	  <para>Where are the mailing list archives stored?</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>The mailing lists are archived under

	      class="fqdomainname"
	      >freefall.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>.</para>

	  <para>I would like to mentor a new committer.  What process

	<answer>
	  <para>See the <link

	<question>
	  <para>Are there any perks of being an &os; committer?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Recognition as a competent software engineer is the
	    longest lasting value.  In addition, getting a chance
	    to work with some of the best people that every engineer
	    would dream of meeting is a great perk!</para>

	  <para>&os; committers can get a free 4-CD or DVD set at
	    conferences from
	    <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsdmall.com">&os; Mall,
	      Inc.</link>.</para>

	  <para>In addition, developers may request a cloaked hostmask
	    for their account on the Freenode IRC network in the form
	    of
	    <literal>freebsd/developer/</literal><replaceable>freefall
	      name</replaceable>
	    or

    <title>Commit Bit Types</title>

    <para>The &os; repository has a number of components which,
      when combined, support the basic operating system source,
      documentation, third party application ports infrastructure, and
      various maintained utilities.  When &os; commit bits are
      allocated, the areas of the tree where the bit may be used are
      specified.  Generally, the areas associated with a bit reflect
      who authorized the allocation of the commit bit.  Additional
      areas of authority may be added at a later date: when this
      occurs, the committer should follow normal commit bit allocation
      procedures for that area of the tree, seeking approval from the
      appropriate entity and possibly getting a mentor for that area
      for some period of time.</para>

    <para>Commit bits allocated prior to the development of the notion
      of areas of authority may be appropriate for use in many parts
      of the tree.  However, common sense dictates that a committer
      who has not previously worked in an area of the tree seek review
      prior to committing, seek approval from the appropriate
      responsible party, and/or work with a mentor.  Since the rules
      regarding code maintenance differ by area of the tree, this is
      as much for the benefit of the committer working in an area of
      less familiarity as it is for others working on the tree.</para>

    <para>Committers are encouraged to seek review for their work as
      part of the normal development process, regardless of the area
      of the tree where the work is occurring.</para>

    <para>It is assumed that you are already familiar with the basic
      operation of the version control systems in use.  Traditionally
      this was CVS.  Subversion is used for the <literal>src</literal>
      tree as of May 2008, the <literal>doc/www</literal> tree as of
      May 2012 and the <literal>ports</literal> tree as of July
      2012.</para>

      might also be useful.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The &os; source repository switched from
	<acronym>CVS</acronym> to Subversion on May 31st, 2008.  The
	first real <acronym>SVN</acronym> commit is
	<emphasis>r179447</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The &os; <literal>doc/www</literal> repository switched
	from <acronym>CVS</acronym> to Subversion on May 19th, 2012.
	The first real <acronym>SVN</acronym> commit is
	<emphasis>r38821</emphasis>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Part of the <literal>doc/www</literal>
	  <acronym>CVS</acronym> to <acronym>SVN</acronym> conversion
	  included an infrastructural change to the build process.
	  The most notable change is the location of the
	  &os;&nbsp;website <literal>www</literal> tree, which has
	  been moved from
	  <literal>www/lang/</literal> to
	  <literal>head/lang/htdocs/</literal>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The &os; <literal>ports</literal> repository switched
	from <acronym>CVS</acronym> to Subversion on July 14th, 2012.
	The first real <acronym>SVN</acronym> commit is
	<emphasis>r300894</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>There are mechanisms in place to automatically merge
	changes back from the Subversion <literal>src</literal>
	repository to the <acronym>CVS</acronym> repository for
	some &os; branches (<literal>releng/6</literal> through
	<literal>releng/9</literal>), however this is purely to
	support pre-existing end-user installs and should not be
	relied upon, recommended or advertised.  Future branches
	will not be exported to CVS at all.  The
	<literal>ports</literal> repository was exported to CVS
	for a period of time to aid end user migration, but as of
	28th February 2013 is no longer exported.</para>

      <para>Subversion is not that different from
	<acronym>CVS</acronym> when it comes to daily use, but there
	are differences.  Subversion has a number of features that
	should make developers' lives easier.  The most important
	advantage to Subversion (and the reason why &os; switched) is
	that it handles branches and merging much better than CVS
	does.  Some of the principal differences are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Commits are atomic.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Revision numbers apply across the repository&mdash;all
	    files that were modified in the same commit have the same
	    revision number.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Branching and tagging are namespace operations.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Directories are versioned.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Files and directories can have arbitrary, versioned
	    metadata attached to them.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Files and directories can be copied, with full history
	    tracking.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>No more contortions due to <acronym>CVS</acronym>
	    weakness such as applying &man.patch.1; files at compile
	    time in order to avoid touching vendor branch code.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>No more repo-copies.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Subversion can be installed from the &os; Ports
	Collection by issuing these commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make clean install</userinput></screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="svn-getting-started">
      <title>Getting Started</title>

      <para>There are a few ways to obtain a working copy of the tree
	from Subversion.  This section will explain them.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="svn-getting-started-direct-checkout">
	<title>Direct Checkout</title>

	<para>The first is to check out directly from the main
	  repository.  For the <literal>src</literal> tree,
	  use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head /usr/src</userinput></screen>

	<para>For the <literal>doc</literal> tree, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/doc/head /usr/doc</userinput></screen>

	<para>For the <literal>ports</literal> tree, use:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head /usr/ports</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Though the remaining examples in this document are
	    written with the workflow of working with the
	    <literal>src</literal> tree in mind, the underlying
	    concepts are the same for working with the
	    <literal>doc</literal> and the <literal>ports</literal>
	    tree.
	    Ports related Subversion operations are listed in
	    <xref linkend="ports"/>.</para>
	</note>

	<para>The above command will check out a
	  <literal>CURRENT</literal> source tree as <filename>/usr/src/</filename>,
	  which can be any target directory on the local filesystem.
	  Omitting the final argument of that command causes the
	  working copy, in this case, to be named <quote>head</quote>,
	  but that can be renamed safely.</para>

	<para><literal>svn+ssh</literal> means the
	  <acronym>SVN</acronym> protocol tunnelled over
	  <acronym>SSH</acronym>.  The name of the server is
	  <literal>svn.freebsd.org</literal>, <literal>base</literal>
	  is the path to the repository, and <literal>head</literal>
	  is the subdirectory within the repository.</para>

	<para>If your &os; login name is different from your login
	  name on your local machine, you must either include it in
	  the <acronym>URL</acronym> (for example
	  <literal>svn+ssh://jarjar@svn.freebsd.org/base/head</literal>),
	  or add an entry to your <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename>
	  in the form:</para>

	<programlisting>Host svn.freebsd.org
	User jarjar</programlisting>

	<para>This is the simplest method, but it's hard to tell just
	  yet how much load it will place on the repository.
	  Subversion is much faster than <acronym>CVS</acronym>,
	  however.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>The <command>svn diff</command> does not require
	    access to the server as <acronym>SVN</acronym> stores a
	    reference copy of every file in the working copy.  This,
	    however, means that Subversion working copies are very
	    large in size.</para>
	</note>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="svn-getting-started-checkout-from-a-mirror">
	<title>Checkout from a Mirror</title>

	<para>Check out a working copy from a mirror by
	  substituting the mirror's <acronym>URL</acronym> for
	  <literal>svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base</literal>.  This can
	  be an official mirror or a mirror maintained by
	  using <command>svnsync</command>.</para>

	<para>There is a serious disadvantage to this method: every
	  time something is to be committed, a
	  <command>svn relocate</command> to the master repository has
	  to be done, remembering to <command>svn relocate</command>
	  back to the mirror after the commit.  Also, since
	  <command>svn relocate</command> only works between
	  repositories that have the same UUID, some hacking of the
	  local repository's UUID has to occur before it is possible
	  to start using it.</para>

	<para>Unlike with <acronym>CVS</acronym>,
	  the hassle of a local
	  <command>svnsync</command> mirror probably is not worth it
	  unless the network connectivity situation or other factors
	  demand it.  If it is needed, see the end of this chapter for
	  information on how to set one up.</para>

	<para><acronym>SVN</acronym> has built in help documentation.

	<para>As seen earlier, to check out the &os; head
	  branch:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head /usr/src</userinput></screen>

	<para>At some point, more than just <literal>HEAD</literal>
	  will probably be useful, for instance when merging changes
	  to stable/7.  Therefore, it may be useful to have a partial
	  checkout of the complete tree (a full checkout would be very
	  painful).</para>

	<para>To do this, first check out the root of the
	  repository:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout --depth=immediates svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base</userinput></screen>

	<para>This will give <literal>base</literal> with all the
	  files it contains (at the time of writing, just
	  <filename>ROADMAP.txt</filename>) and empty subdirectories
	  for <literal>head</literal>, <literal>stable</literal>,
	  <literal>vendor</literal> and so on.</para>

	<para>Expanding the working copy is possible.  Just change the
	  depth of the various subdirectories:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity base/head</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=immediates base/release base/releng base/stable</userinput></screen>

	<para>The above command will pull down a full copy of
	  <literal>head</literal>, plus empty copies of every
	  <literal>release</literal> tag, every
	  <literal>releng</literal> branch, and every
	  <literal>stable</literal> branch.</para>

	<para>If at a later date merging to
	  <literal>7-STABLE</literal> is required, expand the working
	  copy:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity base/stable/7</userinput></screen>

	<para>Subtrees do not have to be expanded completely.  For
	  instance, expanding only <literal>stable/7/sys</literal> and
	  then later expand the rest of

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity base/stable/7/sys</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity base/stable/7</userinput></screen>

	<para>Updating the tree with <command>svn update</command>
	  will only update what was previously asked for (in this

	  <listitem>
	    <para><literal>infinity</literal>: anything.</para>

	<para>Since <literal>--depth</literal> is sticky, there is a

	  <title>About Merge Tracking</title>

	  <para>From the user's perspective, merge tracking
	    information (or mergeinfo) is stored in a property called
	    <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>, which is a
	    comma-separated list of revisions and ranges of revisions
	    that have been merged.  When set on a file, it applies
	    only to that file.  When set on a directory, it applies to
	    that directory and its descendants (files and directories)
	    except for those that have their own
	    <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>.</para>

	  <para>It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> inherited.  For
	    instance, <filename>stable/6/contrib/openpam/</filename>
	    does not implicitly inherit mergeinfo from
	    <filename>stable/6/</filename>, or
	    <filename>stable/6/contrib/</filename>.
	    Doing so would make partial checkouts very hard to manage.
	    Instead, mergeinfo is explicitly propagated down the tree.
	    For merging something into
	    <filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>,
	    the following rules apply:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If
		<filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>
		does not already have a mergeinfo record, but a direct
		ancestor (for instance,
		<filename>branch/foo/</filename>)
		does, then that record will be propagated down to
		<filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>
		before information about the current merge is
		recorded.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Information about the current merge will
		<emphasis>not</emphasis> be propagated back up that
		ancestor.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If a direct descendant of
		<filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>
		(for instance, <filename>branch/foo/bar/baz/</filename>)
		already has a mergeinfo record, information about the
		current merge will be propagated down to it.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>If you consider the case where a revision changes
	    several separate parts of the tree (for example, <filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename> and
	    <filename>branch/foo/quux/</filename>),
	    but you only want to merge some of it (for example,
	    <filename>branch/foo/bar/</filename>),
	    you will see that these rules make sense.  If mergeinfo
	    was propagated up, it would seem like that revision had
	    also been merged to <filename>branch/foo/quux/</filename>, when in
	    fact it had not been.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Selecting the Source and Target</title>

	  <para>Because of mergeinfo propagation, it is important to
	    choose the source and target for the merge carefully to
	    minimise property changes on unrelated directories.</para>

	  <para>The rules for selecting the merge target (the
	    directory that you will merge the changes to) can be
	    summarized as follows:</para>

	      <para>Never merge directly to a file.</para>

		directly to a file.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to kernel code should be merged to
		<filename>sys/</filename>.  For
		instance, a change to the &man.ichwd.4; driver should
		be merged to

		<filename>sys/</filename>, not

		Likewise, a change to the TCP/IP stack should be
		merged to <filename>sys/</filename>,
		not <filename>sys/netinet/</filename>.</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to vendor code (code in

		<filename>contrib/</filename>,
		<filename>crypto/</filename> and so
		on) should be merged to the directory where vendor
		imports happen.  For instance, a change to <filename>crypto/openssl/util/</filename>
		should be merged to <filename>crypto/openssl/</filename>.  This
		is rarely an issue, however, since changes to vendor
		code are usually merged wholesale.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to userland programs should as a general
		rule be merged to the directory that contains the

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changes to userland libraries should as a general
		rule be merged to the directory that contains the

		each have their own Makefile.</para>

	    separately, then commit them together.  For instance, if
	    you merge a revision that changed a kernel
	    <acronym>API</acronym> and updated all the userland bits
	    that used that <acronym>API</acronym>, you would merge the
	    kernel change to sys, and the userland bits to the
	    appropriate userland directories, then commit all of these
	    in one go.</para>

	  <para>The source will almost invariably be the same as the
	    target.  For instance, you will always merge <filename>stable/7/lib/libc/</filename> from
	    <filename>head/lib/libc/</filename>.
	    The only exception would be when merging changes to code
	    that has moved in the source branch but not in the parent
	    branch.  For instance, a change to &man.pkill.1; would be
	    merged from <filename>bin/pkill/</filename> in head to
	    <filename>usr.bin/pkill/</filename> in
	    stable/7.</para>

	  <title>Preparing the Merge Target</title>

	  <para>Because of the mergeinfo propagation issues described
	    earlier, it is very important that you never merge changes
	    into a sparse working copy.  You must always have a full
	    checkout of the branch you will merge into.  For instance,
	    when merging from HEAD to 7, you must have a full checkout
	    of stable/7:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd stable/7</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up --set-depth=infinity</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The target directory must also be up-to-date and must
	    not contain any uncommitted changes or stray files.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Identifying Revisions</title>

	  <para>Identifying revisions to be merged is a must.  If the
	    target already has complete mergeinfo, ask
	    <acronym>SVN</acronym> for a list:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd stable/6/contrib/openpam</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn mergeinfo --show-revs=eligible $FSVN/head/contrib/openpam</userinput></screen>

	  <para>If the target does not have complete mergeinfo, check
	    the log for the merge source.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Merging</title>

	  <para>Now, let us start merging!</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>The Principles</title>

	    <para>Say you would like to merge:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>revision <literal>&dollar;R</literal></para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>in directory &dollar;target in stable branch
		  &dollar;B</para>
	      </listitem>

		<para>&dollar;FSVN is
		  <literal>svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base</literal></para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	    <para>Assuming that revisions &dollar;P and &dollar;Q have
	      already been merged, and that the current directory is
	      an up-to-date working copy of stable/&dollar;B, the
	      existing mergeinfo looks like this:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R $target</userinput>
$target - /head/$source:$P,$Q</screen>

	    <para>Merging is done like so:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge -c$R $FSVN/head/$source $target</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Checking the results of this is possible with
	      <command>svn diff</command>.</para>

	    <para>The svn:mergeinfo now looks like:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R $target</userinput>
$target - head/$source:$P,$Q,$R</screen>

	    <para>If the results are not exactly as shown, assistance
	      may be required before committing as mistakes may have
	      been made, or there may be something wrong with the
	      existing mergeinfo, or there may be a bug in
	      Subversion.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Practical Example</title>

	    <para>As a practical example, consider the following
	      scenario: The changes to <filename>netmap.4</filename>
	      in r238987 is to be merged from CURRENT to 9-STABLE.
	      The file resides in <filename>head/share/man/man4</filename> and
	      according to <xref linkend="svn-advanced-use-merging"/>
	      this is also where to do the merge.  Note that in this
	      example all paths are relative to the top of the svn
	      repository.  For more information on the directory
	      layout, see <xref linkend="svn-getting-started-base-layout"/>.</para>

	    <para>The first step is to inspect the existing
	      mergeinfo.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propget svn:mergeinfo -R stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Take a quick note of how it looks before moving on
	      to the next step; doing the actual merge:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge -c r238987 svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head/share/man/man4 stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput>
--- Merging r238987 into 'stable/9/share/man/man4':
U    stable/9/share/man/man4/netmap.4
--- Recording mergeinfo for merge of r238987 into
'stable/9/share/man/man4':
 U   stable/9/share/man/man4</screen>

	    <para>Check that the revision number of the merged
	      revision has been added.  Once this is verified, the
	      only thing left is the actual commit.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit stable/9/share/man/man4</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Merging into the Kernel
	      (<filename>sys/</filename>)</title>

	    <para>As stated above, merging into the kernel is
	      different from merging in the rest of the tree.  In many
	      ways merging to the kernel is simpler because there is
	      always the same merge target
	      (<filename>sys/</filename>).</para>

	    <para>Once <command>svn merge</command> has been executed,
	      <command>svn diff</command> has to be run on the
	      directory to check the changes.  This may show some
	      unrelated property changes, but these can be ignored.
	      Next, build and test the kernel, and, once the tests are
	      complete, commit the code as normal, making sure that
	      the commit message starts with <quote>Merge
		<replaceable>r226222</replaceable> from head</quote>,
	      or similar.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Precautions Before Committing</title>

	  <para>As always, build world (or appropriate parts of
	    it).</para>

	  <para>Check the changes with <command>svn diff</command> and
	    <command>svn stat</command>.  Make sure all the files that
	    should have been added or deleted were in fact added or
	    deleted.</para>

	  <para>Take a closer look at any property change (marked by a
	    <literal>M</literal> in the second column of <command>svn
	      stat</command>).  Normally, no svn:mergeinfo properties
	    should be anywhere except the target directory (or
	    directories).</para>

	  <para>If something looks fishy, ask for help.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Committing</title>

	  <para>Make sure to commit a top level directory to have the

	  <title>Preparing the Tree</title>

	  <para>If importing for the first time after the switch to
	    Subversion, flattening and cleaning up the vendor tree is
	    necessary, as well as bootstrapping the merge history in
	    the main tree.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Flattening</title>

	    <para>During the conversion from <acronym>CVS</acronym> to
	      Subversion, vendor branches were imported with the same
	      layout as the main tree.  This means that the
	      <literal>pf</literal> vendor sources ended up in
	      <filename>vendor/pf/dist/contrib/pf</filename>.  The
	      vendor source is best directly in
	      <filename>vendor/pf/dist</filename>.</para>

	    <para>To flatten the <literal>pf</literal> tree:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd vendor/pf/dist/contrib/pf</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn mv $(svn list) ../..</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ../..</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn rm contrib</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propdel -R svn:mergeinfo .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	    <para>The <literal>propdel</literal> bit is necessary
	      because starting with 1.5, Subversion will automatically
	      add <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> to any directory
	      that is copied or moved.  In this case, as nothing is
	      being merged from the deleted tree, they just get in the
	      way.</para>

	    <para>Tags may be flattened as well (3, 4, 3.5 etc.); the
	      procedure is exactly the same, only changing
	      <literal>dist</literal> to <literal>3.5</literal> or
	      similar, and putting the <command>svn commit</command>
	      off until the end of the process.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Cleaning Up</title>

	    <para>The <literal>dist</literal> tree can be cleaned up
	      as necessary.  Disabling keyword expansion is
	      recommended, as it makes no sense on unmodified vendor
	      code and in some cases it can even be harmful.
	      <application>OpenSSH</application>, for example,
	      includes two files that originated with &os; and still
	      contain the original version tags.  To do this:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propdel svn:keywords -R .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Bootstrapping Merge History</title>

	    <para>If importing for the first time after the switch to
	      Subversion, bootstrap <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal>
	      on the target directory in the main tree to the revision
	      that corresponds to the last related change to the
	      vendor tree, prior to importing new sources:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd head/contrib/pf</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge --record-only svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pf/dist@180876 .</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Importing New Sources</title>

	  <para>With two commits&mdash;one for the import itself and
	    one for the tag&mdash;this step can optionally be repeated
	    for every upstream release between the last import and the
	    current import.</para>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Preparing the Vendor Sources</title>

	    <para>Unlike in <acronym>CVS</acronym> where only the
	      needed parts were imported into the vendor tree to avoid
	      bloating the main tree, Subversion is able to store a
	      full distribution in the vendor tree.  So, import
	      everything, but merge only what is required.</para>

	    <para>A <command>svn add</command> is required to add any
	      files that were added since the last vendor import, and
	      <command>svn rm</command> is required to remove any that
	      were removed since.  Preparing sorted lists of the
	      contents of the vendor tree and of the sources that are
	      about to be imported is recommended, to facilitate the
	      process.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd vendor/pf/dist</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn list -R | grep -v '/$' | sort &gt;../old</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ../pf-4.3</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>find . -type f | cut -c 3- | sort &gt;../new</userinput></screen>

	    <para>With these two files,
	      <command>comm -23 ../old ../new</command> will list
	      removed files (files only in <filename>old</filename>),
	      while <command>comm -13 ../old ../new</command> will
	      list added files only in
	      <filename>new</filename>.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Importing into the Vendor Tree</title>

	    <para>Now, the sources must be copied into
	      <filename>dist</filename> and
	      the <command>svn add</command> and
	      <command>svn rm</command> commands should be used as
	      needed:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd vendor/pf/pf-4.3</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>tar cf - . | tar xf - -C ../dist</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ../dist</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>comm -23 ../old ../new | xargs svn rm</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>comm -13 ../old ../new | xargs svn --parents add</userinput></screen>

	    <para>If any directories were removed, they will have to
	      be <command>svn rm</command>ed manually.  Nothing will
	      break if they are not, but they will remain in the
	      tree.</para>

	    <para>Check properties on any new files.  All text files
	      should have <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to
	      <literal>native</literal>.  All binary files should have
	      <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> set to
	      <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> unless there
	      is a more appropriate media type.  Executable files
	      should have <literal>svn:executable</literal> set to
	      <literal>*</literal>.  No other properties should exist
	      on any file in the tree.</para>

	    <para>Committing is now possible, however it is good
	      practice to make sure that everything is OK by using the
	      <command>svn stat</command> and
	      <command>svn diff</command> commands.</para>
	  </sect5>

	  <sect5>
	    <title>Tagging</title>

	    <para>Once committed, vendor releases should be tagged for
	      future reference.  The best and quickest way to do this
	      is directly in the repository:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pf/dist svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pf/4.3</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Once that is complete, <command>svn up</command> the
	      working copy of
	      <filename>vendor/pf</filename>
	      to get the new tag, although this is rarely
	      needed.</para>

	    <para>If creating the tag in the working copy of the tree,
	      <command>svn:mergeinfo</command> results must be
	      removed:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd	vendor/pf</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp dist 4.3</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn propdel svn:mergeinfo -R 4.3</userinput></screen>
	  </sect5>
	</sect4>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Merging to Head</title>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd head/contrib/pf</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn up</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn merge --accept=postpone svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pf/dist .</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The <literal>--accept=postpone</literal> tells
	    Subversion that it should not complain because merge
	    conflicts will be taken care of manually.</para>

	  <para>It is necessary to resolve any merge conflicts.
	    This process is the same in <acronym>SVN</acronym> as in
	    <acronym>CVS</acronym>.</para>

	  <para>Make sure that any files that were added or removed in
	    the vendor tree have been properly added or removed in the
	    main tree.  To check diffs against the vendor
	    branch:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn diff --no-diff-deleted --old=svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pf/dist --new=.</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The <literal>--no-diff-deleted</literal> tells
	    Subversion not to complain about files that are in the
	    vendor tree but not in the main tree, i.e., things that
	    would have previously been removed before the vendor
	    import, like for example the vendor's makefiles
	    and configure scripts.</para>

	  <para>Using <acronym>CVS</acronym>, once a file was off the
	    vendor branch, it was not able to be put back.  With
	    Subversion, there is no concept of on or off the vendor
	    branch.  If a file that previously had local
	    modifications, to make it not show up in diffs in the
	    vendor tree, all that has to be done is remove any
	    left-over cruft like &os; version tags, which is much
	    easier.</para>

	  <para>If any changes are required for the world to build
	    with the new sources, make them now, and keep testing
	    until everything builds and runs perfectly.</para>

	    <para>This section is an example of importing and tagging

	    <para>First, prepare the directory in

&prompt.user; <userinput>svn mkdir byacc</userinput>

	    <para>Now, import the sources into the
	      <filename>dist</filename> directory.
	      Once the files are in place, <command>svn add</command>
	      the new ones, then <command>svn commit</command> and tag
	      the imported version.  To save time and bandwidth,
	      direct remote committing and tagging is possible:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn cp -m "Tag byacc 20120115" $FSVN/vendor/byacc/dist $FSVN/vendor/byacc/20120115</userinput></screen>

	<title>Setting up a <application>svnsync</application>

	<para>You probably do not want to do this unless there is a
	  good reason for it.  Such reasons might be to support many
	  multiple local read-only client machines, or if your network
	  bandwidth is limited.  Starting a fresh mirror from empty

	<para>A far better option is to grab a seed file.  It is large
	  (~1GB) but will consume less network traffic and take less

	<para>Once you have the file, extract it to somewhere like
	  <filename>home/svnmirror/base/</filename>.
	  Then, update it, so that it fetches changes since the last
	  revision in the archive:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svnsync sync file:///home/svnmirror/base</userinput></screen>

	<para>You can then set that up to run from &man.cron.8;, do

    <para>The &os; project strongly discourages the so-called
      "advertising clause" in new code.  Due to the large number of
      contributors to the &os; project, complying with this clause for
      many commercial vendors has become difficult.  If you have code
      in the tree with the advertising clause, please consider
      removing it.  In fact, please consider using the above license
      for your code.</para>

    <para>The &os; project discourages completely new licenses and
      variations on the standard licenses.  New licenses require the
      approval of the &a.core; to reside in the
      main repository.  The more different licenses that are used in
      the tree, the more problems that this causes to those wishing to
      utilize this code, typically from unintended consequences from a
      poorly worded license.</para>

    <para>Project policy dictates that code under some non-BSD
      licenses must be placed only in specific sections of the
      repository, and in some cases, compilation must be conditional
      or even disabled by default.  For example, the GENERIC kernel
      must be compiled under only licenses identical to or
      substantially similar to the BSD license.  GPL, APSL, CDDL, etc,
      licensed software must not be compiled into GENERIC.</para>

    <para>Developers are reminded that in open source, getting "open"
      right is just as important as getting "source" right, as
      improper handling of intellectual property has serious
      consequences.  Any questions or concerns should immediately be
      brought to the attention of the core team.</para>

    <title>Developer Relations</title>

    <para>If you are working directly on your own code or on code
      which is already well established as your responsibility, then
      there is probably little need to check with other committers
      before jumping in with a commit.  If you see a bug in an area of
      the system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  If, however, you are
      about to modify something which is clearly being actively
      maintained by someone else (and it is only by watching the
      <literal>repository-committers</literal>
      mailing list that you can really get a feel for just what is and
      is not) then consider sending the change to them instead, just
      as you would have before becoming a committer.  For ports, you
      should contact the listed <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  For other parts of the
      repository, if you are unsure who the active maintainer might
      be, it may help to scan the revision history to see who has
      committed changes in the past.  &a.fenner.email; has written a nice
      shell script that can help determine who the active maintainer
      might be.  It lists each person who has committed to a given
      file along with the number of commits each person has made.  It
      can be found on <systemitem>freefall</systemitem> at
      <filename>~fenner/bin/whodid</filename>.  If your queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit it.</para>

    <para>If you are unsure about a commit for any reason at
      all, have it reviewed by <literal>-hackers</literal>
      before committing.  Better to have it flamed then and there
      rather than when it is part of the repository.  If you do
      happen to commit something which results in controversy
      erupting, you may also wish to consider backing the change out
      again until the matter is settled.  Remember &ndash; with a
      version control system we can always change it back.</para>

    <para>Do not impugn the intentions of someone you disagree with.
      If they see a different solution to a problem than you, or even
      a different problem, it is not because they are stupid, because
      they have questionable parentage, or because they are trying to
      destroy your hard work, personal image, or &os;, but simply
      because they have a different outlook on the world.  Different
      is good.</para>

    <para>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</para>

    <para>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</para>

    <para>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of
      the ways open source software is supposed to excel is in the
      number of eyeballs applied to it; this does not apply if nobody
      will review code.</para>

    <para>As noted, breaking some of these rules can be grounds for
      suspension or, upon repeated offense, permanent removal of
      commit privileges.  Individual members of core have the power to
      temporarily suspend commit privileges until core as a whole has
      the chance to review the issue.  In case of an
      <quote>emergency</quote> (a committer doing damage to the
      repository), a temporary suspension may also be done by the
      repository meisters.  Only a 2/3 majority of core has the
      authority to suspend commit privileges for longer than a week or
      to remove them permanently.  This rule does not exist to set
      core up as a bunch of cruel dictators who can dispose of
      committers as casually as empty soda cans, but to give the
      project a kind of safety fuse.  If someone is out of control, it
      is important to be able to deal with this immediately rather
      than be paralyzed by debate.  In all cases, a committer whose
      privileges are suspended or revoked is entitled to a
      <quote>hearing</quote> by core, the total duration of the
      suspension being determined at that time.  A committer whose
      privileges are suspended may also request a review of the
      decision after 30 days and every 30 days thereafter (unless the
      total suspension period is less than 30 days).  A committer
      whose privileges have been revoked entirely may request a review
      after a period of 6 months has elapsed.  This review policy is
      <emphasis>strictly informal</emphasis> and, in all cases, core
      reserves the right to either act on or disregard requests for
      review if they feel their original decision to be the right
      one.</para>

    <para>In all other aspects of project operation, core is a subset
      of committers and is bound by the
      <emphasis>same rules</emphasis>.  Just because someone is in
      core this does not mean that they have special dispensation to
      step outside any of the lines painted here; core's
      <quote>special powers</quote> only kick in when it acts as a
      group, not on an individual basis.  As individuals, the core
      team members are all committers first and core second.</para>

	  <para>Respect other committers.</para>

	  <para>This means that you need to treat other committers as
	    the peer-group developers that they are.  Despite our
	    occasional attempts to prove the contrary, one does not
	    get to be a committer by being stupid and nothing rankles
	    more than being treated that way by one of your peers.
	    Whether we always feel respect for one another or not (and
	    everyone has off days), we still have to
	    <emphasis>treat</emphasis> other committers with respect
	    at all times, on public forums and in private
	    email.</para>

	  <para>Being able to work together long term is this
	    project's greatest asset, one far more important than any
	    set of changes to the code, and turning arguments about
	    code into issues that affect our long-term ability to work
	    harmoniously together is just not worth the trade-off by
	    any conceivable stretch of the imagination.</para>

	  <para>To comply with this rule, do not send email when you
	    are angry or otherwise behave in a manner which is likely
	    to strike others as needlessly confrontational.  First
	    calm down, then think about how to communicate in the most
	    effective fashion for convincing the other person(s) that
	    your side of the argument is correct, do not just blow off
	    some steam so you can feel better in the short term at the
	    cost of a long-term flame war.  Not only is this very bad
	    <quote>energy economics</quote>, but repeated displays of
	    public aggression which impair our ability to work well
	    together will be dealt with severely by the project
	    leadership and may result in suspension or termination of
	    your commit privileges.  The project leadership will take
	    into account both public and private communications
	    brought before it.  It will not seek the disclosure of
	    private communications, but it will take it into account
	    if it is volunteered by the committers involved in the
	    complaint.</para>

	  <para>All of this is never an option which the project's

	    manual page misspelling, simply that you should try to
	    develop a feel for when a proposed change is not quite
	    such a no-brainer and requires some feedback first.
	    People really do not mind sweeping changes if the result
	    is something clearly better than what they had before,
	    they just do not like being <emphasis>surprized</emphasis>
	    by those changes.  The very best way of making sure that

	    angry words in public and you should not forward private
	    correspondence to public mailing lists or aliases.  What
	    people say one-to-one is often much less sugar-coated than

      <title>Policy on Multiple Architectures</title>

      <para>&os; has added several new architecture ports during
	recent release cycles and is truly no longer an &i386; centric
	operating system.  In an effort to make it easier to keep
	&os; portable across the platforms we support, core has
	developed the following mandate:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<para>Our 32-bit reference platform is &arch.i386;, and our
	  64-bit reference platform is &arch.sparc64;.  Major design
	  work (including major API and ABI changes) must prove
	  itself on at least one 32-bit and at least one 64-bit
	  platform, preferably the primary reference platforms,
	  before it may be committed to the source tree.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>The &arch.i386; and &arch.sparc64; platforms were chosen
	due to being more readily available to developers and as
	representatives of more diverse processor and system designs -
	big versus little endian, register file versus register stack,
	different DMA and cache implementations, hardware page tables
	versus software TLB management etc.</para>

      <para>The &arch.ia64; platform has many of the same
	complications that &arch.sparc64; has, but is still limited in
	availability to developers.</para>

      <para>We will continue to re-evaluate this policy as cost and
	availability of the 64-bit platforms change.</para>

      <para>Developers should also be aware of our Tier Policy for
	the long term support of hardware architectures.  The rules
	here are intended to provide guidance during the development
	process, and are distinct from the requirements for features
	and architectures listed in that section.  The Tier rules for
	feature support on architectures at release-time are more
	strict than the rules for changes during the development
	process.</para>

      <title>Other Suggestions</title>

      <para>When committing documentation changes, use a spell checker

	<command>make lint</command>.</para>

      <para>For all on-line manual pages, run <command>manck</command>
	(from ports) over the manual page to verify all of the cross
	references and file references are correct and that the man
	page has all of the appropriate <varname>MLINK</varname>s
	installed.</para>

      <para>Do not mix style fixes with new functionality.  A style
	fix is any change which does not modify the functionality of
	the code.  Mixing the changes obfuscates the functionality
	change when asking for differences between revisions, which
	can hide any new bugs.  Do not include whitespace changes with
	content changes in commits to <filename>doc/</filename> or
	<filename>www/</filename>.  The extra clutter in the diffs

    <title>Support for Multiple Architectures</title>

    <para>&os; is a highly portable operating system intended to
      function on many different types of hardware architectures.
      Maintaining clean separation of Machine Dependent (MD) and
      Machine Independent (MI) code, as well as minimizing MD code, is
      an important part of our strategy to remain agile with regards
      to current hardware trends.  Each new hardware architecture
      supported by &os; adds substantially to the cost of code
      maintenance, toolchain support, and release engineering.  It
      also dramatically increases the cost of effective testing of
      kernel changes.  As such, there is strong motivation to
      differentiate between classes of support for various
      architectures while remaining strong in a few key architectures
      that are seen as the &os; <quote>target audience</quote>.</para>

      <title>Statement of General Intent</title>

      <para>The &os; Project targets "production quality commercial
	off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end
	embedded systems".  By retaining a focus on a narrow set of
	architectures of interest in these environments, the &os;
	Project is able to maintain high levels of quality, stability,
	and performance, as well as minimize the load on various
	support teams on the project, such as the ports team,
	documentation team, security officer, and release engineering
	teams.  Diversity in hardware support broadens the options for
	&os; consumers by offering new features and usage
	opportunities (such as support for 64-bit CPUs, use in
	embedded environments, etc.), but these benefits must always
	be carefully considered in terms of the real-world maintenance
	cost associated with additional platform support.</para>

      <para>The &os; Project differentiates platform targets into
	four tiers.  Each tier includes a specification of the
	requirements for an architecture to be in that tier,
	as well as specifying the obligations of developers with
	regards to the platform.  In addition, a policy is defined
	regarding the circumstances required to change the tier

      <title>Tier 1: Fully Supported Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 1 platforms are fully supported by the security
	officer, release engineering, and toolchain maintenance staff.
	New features added to the operating system must be fully
	functional across all Tier 1 architectures for every release
	(features which are inherently architecture-specific, such as
	support for hardware device drivers, may be exempt from this
	requirement).  In general, all Tier 1 platforms must have
	build and Tinderbox support either in the FreeBSD.org cluster,
	or be easily available for all developers.  Embedded platforms
	may substitute an emulator available in the &os; cluster
	for actual hardware.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be Production Quality
	with respects to all aspects of the &os; operating system,
	including installation and development environments.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be completely
	integrated into the source tree and have all features
	necessary to produce an entire system relevant for that target
	architecture.  Tier 1 architectures generally have at least 6
	active developers.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be fully supported by
	the ports system.  All the ports should build on a Tier 1
	platform, or have the appropriate filters to prevent the
	inappropriate ones from building there.  The packaging system
	must support all Tier 1 architectures.  To ensure an
	architecture's Tier 1 status, proponents of that architecture
	must show that all relevant packages can be built on that
	platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 embedded architectures must be able to cross-build
	packages on at least one other Tier 1 architecture.  The
	packages must be the most relevant for the platform, but may
	be a non-empty subset of those that build natively.</para>

      <para>Tier 1 architectures must be fully documented.  All basic
	operations need to be covered by the handbook or other
	documents.  All relevant integration documentation must also
	be integrated into the tree, or readily available.</para>

      <title>Tier 2: Developmental Architectures</title>

      <para>Tier 2 platforms are not supported by the security officer

	responsible for toolchain support in the tree.  The toolchain
	maintainer is expected to work with the platform maintainers
	to refine these changes.  Major new toolchain components are
	allowed to break support for Tier 2 architectures if the

	The toolchain maintainers are expected to provide prompt
	review of any proposed changes and cannot block, through their
	inaction, changes going into the tree.  New features added to
	&os; should be feasible to implement on these platforms,
	but an implementation is not required before the feature may
	be added to the &os; source tree.  New features that may be
	difficult to implement on Tier 2 architectures should provide
	a means of disabling them on those architectures.  The
	implementation of a Tier 2 architecture may be committed to
	the main &os; tree as long as it does not interfere with
	production work on Tier 1 platforms, or substantially with
	other Tier 2 platforms.  Before a Tier 2 platform can be added
	to the &os; base source tree, the platform must be able to
	boot multi-user on actual hardware.  Generally, there must be
	at least three active developers working on the
	platform.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures are usually systems targeted at Tier
	1 support, but that are still under development.
	Architectures reaching end of life may also be moved from Tier
	1 status to Tier 2 status as the availability of resources to
	continue to maintain the system in a Production Quality state
	diminishes.  Well supported niche architectures may also be
	Tier 2.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures may have some support for them
	integrated into the ports infrastructure.  They may have cross
	compilation support added, at the discretion of portmgr.  Some
	ports must built natively into packages if the package system
	supports that architecture.  If not integrated into the base
	system, some external patches for the architecture for ports
	must be available.</para>

      <para>Tier 2 architectures can be integrated into the &os;
	handbook.  The basics for how to get a system running must be
	documented, although not necessarily for every single board or
	system a Tier 2 architecture supports.  The supported hardware
	list must exist and should be no more than a couple of months
	old.  It should be integrated into the &os;
	documentation.</para>

      <para>Current Tier 2 platforms are &arch.arm;, &arch.ia64;,

	Tier 3 platforms are architectures in the early stages of

	are considered legacy systems unlikely to see broad future
	use.  New Tier 3 systems will not be committed to the base
	source tree.  Support for Tier 3 systems may be worked on in
	the &os; Perforce Repository, providing source control and
	easier change integration from the main &os; tree.
	Platforms that transition to Tier 3 status may be removed from
	the tree if they are no longer actively supported by the
	&os; developer community at the discretion of the release
	engineer.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms may have ports support, either integrated
	or external, but do not require it.</para>

      <para>Tier 3 platforms must have the basics documented for how

	  <answer>
	    <para>First, please read the section about repository
	      copies.</para>

	    <para>The easiest way to add a new port is to use the
	      <command>addport</command> script from your machine
	      (located in the <filename>ports/Tools/scripts</filename>
	      directory).  It will add a port from the directory you
	      specify, determining the category automatically from the
	      port <filename>Makefile</filename>.  It will also add an
	      entry to the port's category
	      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  It was written by
	      &a.mharo.email;, &a.will.email;, and &a.garga.email;.

	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Check the port, preferably to make sure it compiles
	      and packages correctly.  This is the recommended
	      sequence:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make install</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make package</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make deinstall</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add package you built above</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make deinstall</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make reinstall</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make package</userinput></screen>

	    <para>The <link xlink:href="&url.books.porters-handbook;/index.html">Porters
		Handbook</link> contains more detailed
	      instructions.</para>

	    <para>Use &man.portlint.1; to check the syntax of the
	      port.  You do not necessarily have to eliminate all
	      warnings but make sure you have fixed the simple
	      ones.</para>

	    <para>If the port came from a submitter who has not
	      contributed to the Project before, add that person's
	      name to the <link xlink:href="&url.articles.contributors;/contrib-additional.html">Additional
		Contributors</link> section of the &os;
	      Contributors List.</para>

	    <para>Close the PR if the port came in as a PR.  To close
	      a PR, just do <userinput>edit-pr
		PR#</userinput> on
	      <systemitem>freefall</systemitem> and change the
	      <varname>state</varname> from <constant>open</constant>

	<title>Repository Copies</title>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>When do we need a repository copy?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When you want to add a port that is related to
	      any port that is already in the tree in a separate
	      directory, you have to do a repository copy.
	      Here <wordasword>related</wordasword> means
	      it is a different version or a slightly modified
	      version.  Examples are
	      <filename>print/ghostscript*</filename> (different
	      versions) and <filename>x11-wm/windowmaker*</filename>
	      (English-only and internationalized version).</para>

	    <para>Another example is when a port is moved from one
	      subdirectory to another, or when you want to change the
	      name of a directory because the author(s) renamed their
	      software even though it is a
	      descendant of a port already in a tree.</para>

	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Before a release, it is necessary to restrict

	      while the packages and the release itself are being

	  <question>
	    <para>What is a <quote>ports slush</quote> or
	      <quote>feature freeze</quote>?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>During a release cycle the ports tree may be in a
	      <quote>slush</quote> state instead of in a hard freeze.
	      The goal during a slush is to reach a stable ports tree
	      to avoid rebuilding large sets of packages for the
	      release and to tag the tree.  During this time
	      <quote>sweeping changes</quote> are prohibited unless
	      specifically permitted by portmgr.  Complete details
	      about what qualifies as a sweeping change can be found
	      on the <link xlink:href="&url.base;/portmgr/implementation.html">Portmgr
		Implementation page</link>.</para>

	    <para>The benefit of a slush as opposed to a complete
	      freeze is that it allows maintainers to continue adding
	      new ports, making routine version updates, and bug fixes
	      to most existing ports, as long as the number of
	      affected ports is minimal.  For example, updating the
	      shared library version on a port that many other ports

	    <para>During a ports slush, you are still allowed to

	      messages to the &a.ports; and &a.committers;
	      announcing the start of the impending release, usually
	      two or three weeks in advance.  The exact starting time
	      will not be determined until a few days before the
	      actual release.  This is because the ports slush has to
	      be synchronized with the release, and it is usually not
	      known until then when exactly the release will be
	      rolled.</para>

		      <command>make describe</command> over the entire
		      ports hierarchy, catching any errors here will
		      save you having to re-run that step later
		      on.</para>
		  </step>

		  <step>

	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>Check that the <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>s are
		  correct.  The ports system uses each port's
		  <varname>CATEGORIES</varname> entry to create its
		  <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>, which is used to
		  connect installed packages to the port directory
		  they were built from.  If this entry is wrong,
		  common port tools like &man.pkg.version.1; and
		  &man.portupgrade.1; fail.</para>

		<para>To do this, use the
		  <filename>chkorigin.sh</filename> tool, as follows:
		  <command>env
		  PORTSDIR=/path/to/ports
		  sh -e
		  /path/to/ports/Tools/scripts/chkorigin.sh</command>.
		  This will check <emphasis>every</emphasis> port in
		  the ports tree, even those not connected to the
		  build, so you can run it directly after the move
		  operation.  Hint: do not forget to look at the
		  <varname>PKGORIGIN</varname>s of any slave ports of
		  the ports you just moved!</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>On your own local system, test the proposed
		  changes: first, comment out the
		  <varname>SUBDIR</varname> entries in the old ports'
		  categories' <filename>Makefile</filename>s; then
		  enable building the new category in
		  <filename>ports/Makefile</filename>.  Run
		  <command>make checksubdirs</command> in the affected
		  category directories to check the
		  <varname>SUBDIR</varname> entries.  Next, in the
		  <filename>ports/</filename>
		  directory, run <command>make index</command>.  This
		  can take over 40 minutes on even modern systems;
		  however, it is a necessary step to prevent problems
		  for other people.</para>
	      </step>

	      <step>
		<para>Once this is done, you can commit the updated
		  <filename>ports/Makefile</filename> to connect the
		  new category to the build and also commit the
		  <filename>Makefile</filename> changes for the old
		  category or categories.</para>
	      </step>

	<title>Miscellaneous Questions</title>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>How do I know if my port is building correctly or
	      not?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>First, go check <uri xlink:href="http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/">http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/</uri>.
	      There you will find error logs from the latest package
	      building runs on all supported platforms for the most
	      recent branches.</para>

	    <para>However, just because the port does not show up
	      there does not mean it is building correctly.  (One of
	      the dependencies may have failed, for instance.)  The
	      relevant directories are available on
	      <systemitem>pointyhat</systemitem> under <filename>/a/portbuild/&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;major_version&gt;</filename>
	      so feel free to dig around.  Each architecture and
	      version has the following subdirectories:</para>

	    <programlisting>errors        error logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
logs          all logs from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
packages      packages from latest &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/errors    error logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/logs      all logs from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;
bak/packages  packages from last complete &lt;major_version&gt; run on &lt;arch&gt;</programlisting>

	    <para>Basically, if the port shows up in
	      <filename>packages</filename>, or it is in
	      <filename>logs</filename> but not in
	      <filename>errors</filename>, it built fine.  (The
	      <filename>errors</filename> directories are what you get
	      from the web page.)</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>I added a new port.  Do I need to add it to the
	      <filename>INDEX</filename>?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>No.  The file can either be generated
	      by running <command>make index</command>, or a
	      pre-generated version can be downloaded with
	      <command>make fetchindex</command>.</para>

	      or any file under a subdirectory that starts with an
	      uppercase letter (<filename>Mk/</filename>,
	      <filename>Tools/</filename>, etc.).  In particular, the
	      Ports Management Team is very protective of
	      <filename>ports/Mk/bsd.port*.mk</filename> so do not
	      commit changes to those files unless you want to face

	  <question>
	    <para>What is the proper procedure for updating the
	      checksum for a port's distfile when the file changes
	      without a version change?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>When the checksum for a port's distfile is updated
	      due to the author updating the file without changing the
	      port's revision, the commit message should include a
	      summary of the relevant diffs between the original and
	      new distfile to ensure that the distfile has not been
	      corrupted or maliciously altered.  If the current
	      version of the port has been in the ports tree for a
	      while, a copy of the old distfile will usually be
	      available on the ftp servers; otherwise the author or
	      maintainer should be contacted to find out why the
	      distfile has changed.</para>

    <title>Introduction and Background</title>

    <para>After nearly three years of work, &os; 5.0 was released in January
      of 2003.  Features like the GEOM block layer, Mandatory Access Controls,
      ACPI, &sparc64; and ia64 platform support, and UFS snapshots, background
      filesystem checks, and 64-bit inode sizes make it an exciting operating
      system for both desktop and production users.  However, some important
      features are not complete.  The foundations for fine-grained locking
      and preemption in the kernel exist, but much more work is left to be
      done.  Work on Kernel Schedulable Entities (KSE), similar to Scheduler
      Activations, has been ongoing but needs a push to realize its benefit.
      Performance compared to &os; 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable> has
      declined and must be restored and surpassed.</para>

    <para>This is somewhat similar to the situation that &os; faced in the
      3.<replaceable>X</replaceable> series.  Work on 3-CURRENT trudged along
      seemingly forever, and finally a cry was made to <quote>just ship it</quote> and
      clean up later.  This decision resulted in the 3.0 and 3.1 releases
      being very unsatisfying for most, and it wasn't until 3.2 that the
      series was considered <quote>stable</quote>.  To make matters worse, the &t.releng.3;
      branch was created along with the 3.0 release, and the &t.releng.head; branch was
      allowed to advance immediately towards 4-CURRENT.  This resulted in a
      quick divergence between &t.releng.head; and &t.releng.3;, making maintenance of the
      &t.releng.3; branch very difficult.  &os; 2.2.8 was left for quite a while
      as the last production-quality version of &os;.</para>

    <para>Our intent is to avoid repeating that scenario with &os; 5.x.
      Delaying the &t.releng.5; branch until it is stable and production quality
      will ensure that it stays maintainable and provides a compelling reason
      to upgrade from 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable>,  To do this, we must
      identify the current areas of weakness and set clear goals for
      resolving them.  This document contains what we as the release
      engineering team feel are the milestones and issues that must be
      resolved for the &t.releng.5; branch.  It does not dictate every aspect of
      &os; development, and we welcome further input.  Nothing that follows
      is meant to be a sleight against any person or group, or to trivialize
      any work that has been done.  There are some significant issues,
      though, that need decisive and unbiased action.</para>

    <title>Major issues</title>

    <para>The state of SMPng and kernel lockdown is the biggest concern for
      5.<replaceable>X</replaceable>.  To date, few major systems have come
      out from under the kernel-wide mutex known as <quote>Giant</quote>.
      The SMP status page at <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/smp"></ulink>
      provides a comprehensive breakdown
      of the overall SMPng status.  Status specific to SMPng progress in
      device drivers can be found at at
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/busdma"></ulink>.
      In summary:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>VM: the kmem_malloc(M_NOWAIT) path no longer needs Giant held.
          The kmem_malloc(M_WAITOK) path is in progress and is expected to be
          finished in the coming weeks.  Other facets of the VM system, like
          the VFS interface, buffer/cache, etc, are largely untouched.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>GEOM: The GEOM block layer was designed to run free of Giant,
          but at this time no block drivers can run without Giant.
          Additionally, it has the potential to suffer performance loss due
          to its upcall/downcall data paths happening in kernel threads.
          Lightweight context switches might help this.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Network: Locking of the TCP and UDP portions of the stack is
          complete.  Work is in progress to lock up the IP stack, including
          the routing tree, ARP code, raw IP, and ifaddr and inet data
          structures.  IPv6 has been lightly touched during the inp locking
          but is hindered by the KAME code being significantly out of date.
          Work has not started on any of the other protocols such as
          AppleTalk, XNS, or IPX.  Locking of the socket layer is in progress
          but has been largely untested.  None of the hardware drivers or
          Ethernet layers have been locked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>VFS: Initial pre-cleanup started.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>buffer/cache: Initial work complete.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Proc: Work on locking the proc structure was ongoing for a
          while but seems to have stalled.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>CAM: No significant work has occurred on the CAM SCSI
          layer.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Newbus: some work has started on locking down the device_t
          structure.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Pipes: complete with the exception of VM-related
          optimizations.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>File descriptors: complete.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Process accounting: jails, credentials, MAC labels, and
          scheduler are out from under Giant.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>MAC Framework: complete</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
         <para>Timekeeping: complete</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>kernel encryption: crypto drivers and core &man.crypto.4; framework are
          Giant-free.  KAME IPsec and FAST IPSec have not been locked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Sound subsystem: complete</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>kernel preemption: preemption for interrupt threads is enabled.
          However, contention due to Giant covering much of the kernel and
          most of the device driver interrupt routines causes excessive
          context switches and might actually be hurting performance.  Work
          is underway to explore ways to make preemption be
          conditional.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Another issue with SMPng is interrupt latency.  The overhead of
      doing a complete context switch to a kernel interrupt thread is high
      and shows noticeable latency.  Work is ongoing to implement lazy
      context switching on all platforms.  Fine grained locking of drivers
      will also help this, as will converting drivers to be as efficient as
      possible in their interrupt routines.</para>

    <para>Next, the state of KSE must resolved for &t.releng.5;.  Work on it has
      slowed noticeably in the past 6 months but appears to be picking up
      again.  There are a number of issues that must be addressed:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The userland threading library, currently called libkse, is
          immature and has not been used for any significant threaded
          application.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>KSE has the potential to uncover latent race conditions and
          create new ones.  An audit needs to be performed to ensure that no
          obvious problems exist.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>According to the release schedule below, KSE kernel and userland
      components must be functionality complete by June 2003 in order to be
      included in the &t.releng.5; branch.  For security and stability reasons,
      if KSE cannot be finished in time then, by default, all KSE-specific
      syscalls should be modified to return ENOSYS and all other KSE-specific
      interfaces disabled.  Deprecating KSE from &t.releng.5; but keeping it in
      the &t.releng.head; branch will pose problems in porting bugfixes and features
      between the two branches, so every effort should be made to finish it
      on time.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="goals">
    <title>Goals for 5-STABLE</title>

    <para>The goals for the &t.releng.5; branch point are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>All subsystems and interfaces must be mature enough to be
          maintainable for improvements and bug fixes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Equal or better stability from &os; 4.8.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>No functional regressions from 4.8.  It is important to make
          sure that users do not avoid upgrading to 5.x because of lost
          functionality.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Performance on par with &os; 4.8 for most common operations.
          Both UP and SMP configurations should be evaluated.  SMP has the
          potential to perform much better than
          4.<replaceable>X</replaceable>, though for the purposes of creating
          the &t.releng.5; branch, comparable performance between the two should
          be acceptable.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is unrealistic to expect that the SMPng project will be fully
      complete by &t.releng.5;, or that performance will be significantly better
      than 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable>. However, focusing on a subset of
      the outstanding tasks will give enough benefit for the branch to be
      viable and maintainable.  To break it down:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>ABI/API/Infrastructure stability - Enough infrastructure must
          be in place and stable to allow fixes from &t.releng.head; to easily and
          safely be merged into &t.releng.5;.  Also, we must draw a line as to
          what subsystems are to be locked down when we go into
          5-STABLE.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>SMPng</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>VM: Most codepaths, others than the ones that interact with
              VFS, should be Giant-free for &t.releng.5;.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Network: Taking the network stack out from under Giant poses
              the risk of uncovering latent bugs and races.  Locking it down
              but not removing Giant imposes further performance penalties.  A
              decision on which parts of the network stack should be locked and
              taken out from under Giant for &t.releng.5; should be made no later
              than March 15.  Work on the IP, TCP, UDP,raw IP, routing sockets,
              and &unix; domain sockets stands a good chance of being complete in
              time for &t.releng.5;.</para>

            <para>If the decision is made to not lift Giant from the stack,
              then the locks in these layers could be optimized out with a
              kernel config option.  Having a Giant-free path from the the
              hardware layer to the IP queues should be investigated as it
              could allow significant performance gains in the network
              benchmarks.  If this can be achieved then the hardware interface
              layer needs to allow for drivers to incrementally become free of
              Giant.  Locking down at least two Ethernet drivers would be
              highly desirable.  If the semantics are too complex to have the
              stack free of Giant but not the hardware drivers, investigation
              should be done into making it configurable.</para>

            <para>Lesser-used network stacks like netatalk, netipx, etc, should
              not break while this work is going on.  However, locking them is
              not a high priority.  Special kernel config options might be
              needed in order for these layers to operate with the rest of the
              stack being locked and Giant free.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>GEOM: At least 2 block drivers should be locked in order to
              demonstrate that others can also be locked without changing the
              interface to GEOM.  The ATA driver is a good candidate for this,
              though caution should be taken as it is also extremely
              high-profile and any problems with it will affect nearly all
              users of &os;.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Lazy context switching: sparc64 is the only platform that
              performs lazy context switching when entering the kernel.  The
              performance gains promised by this are significant enough to
              require that it be implemented for all other Tier-1
              platforms.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KSE: The kernel side of KSE must be functionally complete and
            have undergone a security audit.  libkse must be complete enough to
            demonstrate a real-world application running correctly on it using
            the standard &posix; Threads API.  Examples would be apache 2.0,
            &java;, and/or mozilla.  A functional regression test suite is also a
            requirement for &t.releng.5; and should test signal delivery,
            scheduling, performance, and process security/credentials for both
            KSE and non-KSE processes.  KSE kernel and userland components must
            also reach the same level of functionality for all Tier-1 platforms
            in both UP and SMP configurations.  The definition of <quote>Tier-1
            platforms</quote> can be found in
	    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/archs.html"></ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>busdma interface and drivers: architectures like PAE/&i386; and
            sparc64 which don't have a direct mapping between host memory
            address space and expansion bus address space require the
            elimination for vtophys() and friends.  The busdma interface was
            created to handle exactly this problem, but many drivers do not use
            it yet.  The busdma project at
            <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/busdma"></ulink>
            tracks the
            progress of this and should be used to determine which drivers
            must be converted for &t.releng.5; and which can be left behind.
            Also, there has been talk by several developers and the original
            author to give the busdma interface a minor overhaul.  If this is
            to happen, it needs to happen before &t.releng.5;.  Otherwise,
            differences between the old and new API will make driver
            maintenance difficult.</para>

            systems no longer configure PCI devices from the system BIOS,
            leaving this task solely to the OS.  &os; must gain the ability to
            manage and allocate PCI memory resources on its own.  Implementing
            this should take into account cardbus, PCI-HotPlug, and laptop
            dockstation requirements.  This feature will become increasingly
            critical through the lifetime of &t.releng.5;, and therefore is a

          <para>Storage I/O: I/O performance suffers from two problems, too
            many expensive context switches, and too much work being done
            in interrupt threads.  Specifically, it takes 3 context
            switches for most drivers to get from the hardware completion
            interrupt to unblocking the user process:  one for the
            interrupt thread, one for the GEOM g_up thread, and one to get
            back to the user thread.  Drivers that attempt to be efficient
            and quick in their interrupt handlers (as all should be)
            usually also schedule a taskqueue, which adds a context switch
            in between the interrupt thread and the g_up thread and brings
            the total up to 4.  Two things need to be done to attack
            this:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Make all drivers defer most of their processing out of
              their interrupt thread.  Significant performance gains have
              been shown recently in the &man.aac.4; driver by making its
              interrupt handler be <literal>INTR_MPSAFE</literal> and moving
              all processing to a taskqueue.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>investigate eliminating the taskqueue context switch by
              adding a callback to the g_up thread that allows a driver to

          <para>ACPI: Intel's ACPI power management and device configuration
            subsystem has become an integral part of &os;'s x86 and ia64
            device configuration model.  However, many bugs exist in Intel's
            vendor code, our OS-specific code, and motherboard BIOSes, causing
            many ACPI-enabled systems to fail to boot, misdetect drivers,
            and/or have many other problems.  Fixing these problems seems to
            be an uphill battle and is often times causing a poor
            first-impression of &os; 5.0.  Most x86 systems can function with
            ACPI disabled, and logic should be added to the boot loader and
            sysinstall to allow users to easily and intuitively turn it off.
            Turning off ACPI by default is prone to problems also as many
            newer systems rely on it to provide correct interrupt routing
            information.  Also, a centralized resource should be created to
            track ACPI problems and solutions.  Linux uses the same Intel
            vendor sources as &os;, so we should investigate how they have
            handled some of the known problems.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>NEWCARD/OLDCARD: The NEWCARD subsystem was made the default
            for &os; 5.0.  Unfortunately, it contains no support for
            non-Cardbus bridges and falls victim to interrupt routine
            problems on some laptops.  The classic 16-bit bridge support,
            OLDCARD, still exists and can be compiled in, but this is highly
            inconvenient for users of older laptops.  If OLDCARD cannot be
            completely deprecated for &t.releng.5;, then provisions must be made
            to allow users to easily install an OLDCARD-enabled kernel.
            Documentation should be written to help transition users from
            OLDCARD to NEWCARD and from &man.pccardd.8; to
            &man.devd.8;.  The power management and
            <quote>dumpcis</quote> functionality of &man.pccardc.8; needs to be
            brought forward to work with NEWCARD, along with the ability to
            load CIS quirk entries.  Most of this functionality can be
            integrated into &man.devd.8; and
            &man.devctl.4;.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>New scheduler framework: The new scheduler framework is in
            place, and users can select between the classic 44bsd scheduler
            and the new ULE scheduler.  A scheduler that demonstrates
            processor affinity, HyperThreading and KSE awareness, and no
            regressions in performance or interactivity characteristics must
            be available for &t.releng.5;.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>sparc64 local console: neither syscons nor vt work on
             sparc64, leaving it with only serial and <quote>fake</quote> OFW
             console support.  This is a major support hole for what is a
             Tier-1 platform.  Whether syscons can be shoe-horned in or
             wscons be adopted from NetBSD is up for debate.  However,
             sparc64 must have local console support for &t.releng.5;.  Having
             this will also enable the XFree86 server to run, which is also a
             requirement for &t.releng.5;.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>gcc/toolchain: gcc 3.3 might be available in time for
            &t.releng.5; and might offer some attractive benefits, but also
            likely to introduce ABI incompatibility with prior gcc versions.
            ABI compatibility should be locked down for the &t.releng.5;
            branch.</para>

          <para>There has also been a request to move /usr/include/g++ to
            /usr/include/g++-v3 to be more compliant with the stock behavior
            of gcc.  This should also be investigated for &t.releng.5;.</para>

           <para>gdb: gdb from the base system should work for sparc64.  It
             should also understand KSE thread semantics, assuming that KSE
             is included in the &t.releng.5; branch.  gdb 5.3 is available and
             there are reports that it should address the sparc64 issue.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>&man.disklabel.8; regressions: The biggest casualty of the
            introduction of GEOM appears to be the disklabel utility.  The
            <option>-r</option> option gives unpredictable results in most
            cases now and should be removed or fixed.  Work is planned for a
            new unified interface for modifying labels and slices, however
            this should not preclude disklabel from being fixed.</para>

    <title>Schedule</title>

    <para>If branching &t.releng.5; at the 5.1 release is paramount, 5.1 will
      probably need to move out by at least 3 months.  The schedule would
      be:</para>

    <para>Taking an incremental approach might be more beneficial.  Releasing
      5.1 in time for USENIX ATC 2003 will provide a wide audience for
      productive feedback and will keep &os; visible.  In this scenario, 5.1
      should offer a significant improvement over 5.0 in terms of bug fixes
      and performance.  Lockdowns and improvements to the storage subsystem
      and scheduler should be expected, the NEWCARD/OLDCARD issues should be
      addressed, and all known bugs and regressions from the 5.0 errata list
      should be fixed.  KSE and other SMPng tasks that cannot finish in time
      for 5.1 should also not reduce the stability of the release.  The
      schedule for this would be:</para>

    <title>Post &t.releng.5; direction</title>

    <para> As with all -STABLE development streams, the focus should be bug
      fixes and incremental improvements.  Just like normal, everything
      should be vetted through the &t.releng.head; branch first and committed to
      &t.releng.5; with caution.  As before, new device drivers, incremental
      features, etc, will be welcome in the branch once they have been proven
      in &t.releng.head;.</para>

    <para>Further SMPng lockdowns will be divided into two categories, driver
      and subsystem.  The only subsystem that will be sufficiently locked
      down for &t.releng.5; will be GEOM, so incrementally locking down device
      drivers under it is a worthy goal for the branch.  Full subsystem
      lockdowns will have to be fully tested and proven in &t.releng.head; before
      consideration will be given to merging them into &t.releng.5;.</para>

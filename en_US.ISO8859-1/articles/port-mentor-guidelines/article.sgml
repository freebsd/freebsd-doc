    <title>Guideline for Mentor/Mentee relationships</title>

    <para>This section is intended to help demystify the
      mentoring process, as well as a way to openly promote a
      constructive discussion to adapt and grow the guidelines.
      In our lives we have too many rules; we are not a
      government organization that inflicts regulation,
      but rather a collective of like minded individuals
      working toward a common goal, maintaining the quality
      assurance of the product we call the Ports Tree.</para>

      <title>Why mentor?</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>For most of us, we were mentored into the
	    Project, so return the favor by offering to mentor
	    somebody else in.</para>

          <para>You have an irresistible urge to inflict knowledge

	  <para>Significant timezone differential.
	    Accessible, interactive mentor(s) available via

	<listitem>
	  <para>Potential language barrier.  Yes, &os; is very
	    English oriented, as is most software development,
	    however, having a mentor who can speak a native language
	    can be very useful.</para>

	  <para>ENOTIME!  Until there is a 30 hour day, and an 8 day

    <sect2 id="mentor.expectations">
      <title>Expectations</title>

      <para>We expect mentors to review and test-build all proposed
        patches, at least for an initial period lasting more than a
	week or two.</para>

      <para>We expect that mentors should take responsibility for
        the actions of their mentee.  A mentor should follow up with
	all commits the mentee makes, both approved
	and implicit.</para>

      <para>We expect mentors to make sure their mentees read the
	<ulink url="&url.books.porters-handbook;">Porter's
	Handbook</ulink>, the <ulink
	url="&url.articles.pr-guidelines">PR handling guide</ulink>, and
	the <ulink url="&url.articles.committers-guide">Committer's
	Guide</ulink>.  While it's not necessary to memorize all the
	details, every committer needs to have an overview of these
	things to be an effective part of the community (and avoid as
	many rookie mistakes as possible).</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="mentees">
      <title>Selecting a mentee</title>

      <para>There is no defined rule for what makes a candidate ready; it
	can be a combination of number of PRs they have submitted to
	<application>GNATS</application>, the number of ports maintained,
	frequency of ports updates and/or level of participation in a
	particular area of interest, e.g.  <application>GNOME</application>,
	<application>KDE</application>, <application>Gecko</application>
	or others.</para>

      <para>A candidate should have almost no timeouts, be responsive to
	requests, and generally helpful in supporting their ports.</para>

      <para>There must be a history of commitment, as it is widely
	understood that training a committer requires time and effort.  If
	somebody has been around longer, and spent the time observing how
	things are done, there is some anticipation of accumulated
	knowledge.  All too often we have seen a maintainer submit a few
	PRs, show up in IRC and ask when they will be given a commit
	bit.</para>

      <para>Being subscribed to, and following the mailing lists is very
	beneficial.  There is no real expectation that submitting posts on
	the lists will make somebody a committer, but it demonstrates a
	commitment.  Some mails offer insights into the knowledge of a
	candidate as well how they interact with others.
	Similarly participating in IRC can give somebody a
	higher profile.</para>

      <para>Ask six different committers how many PRs a maintainer should
	submit prior to being nominated, and you will get six different
	answers.  Ask those same individuals how long somebody should have
	been participating, same dilemma.  How many ports should they have
	at a minimum?  Now we have a bikeshed!  Some things are just hard
	to quantify, a mentor will just have to use their best judgement,
	and hope that portmgr agrees.</para>

    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="mentorship.duration">
      <title>Mentorship duration</title>

      <para>As the trust level develops and grows, the mentee may be
	granted <quote>implicit</quote> commit rights.  This can include
	trivial changes to a <filename>Makefile</filename>,
	<filename>pkg-descr</filename> etc.  Similarly, it may include
	<makevar>PORTVERSION</makevar> updates that do not include
	<makevar>plist</makevar> changes.  Other circumstances may be
	formulated at the discretion of the Mentor.  However, during the
	period of mentorship, a port version bump that affects dependent
	ports should be checked by a mentor.</para>

      <para>Just as we are all varied individuals, each mentee has
	different learning curves, time commitments, and other influencing
	factors that will contribute to the time required before they can
	<quote>fly solo</quote>.  Empirically, a mentee should be observed
	for at least 3 months.  90-100 commits is another target that a
	mentor could use before releasing a mentee.  Other factors to
	consider prior releasing a mentee are the number of mistakes they
	may have made, QATs received etc.  If they are still making rookie
	mistakes, they still require mentor guidance.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="mentor.comentor.debate">
      <title>Mentor/Co-Mentor debate</title>

      <para>When a request gets to portmgr, it usually reads as,
	<quote>I propose 'foo' for a ports commit bit, I will co-mentor
	with 'bar'</quote>.  Proposal received, voted, and carried.</para>

      <para>The mentor is the primary point of contact or the
	<quote>first among equals</quote>, the co-mentor is the backup.</para>

      <para>Some reprobate, whose name shall be withheld, made the
	<ulink url="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-ports/2007-September/134614.html">
	first recorded co-mentor commit</ulink>.  Similar co-mentor commits
	have also been spotted in the src tree.  Does this make it right?
	Does this make it wrong?  It seems to be part of the evolution of
	how things are done.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="mentee.expectations">
      <title>Expectations</title>

      <para>We expect mentees to be prepared for constructive criticism
	from the community.  There's still a lot of <quote>lore</quote>
	that isn't written down.  Responding well to constructive criticism
	is what we hope we are selecting for by first reviewing their
	existing contributions on IRC and mailing lists.</para>

      <para>We warn mentees that some of the criticism they receive may be
	less <quote>constructive</quote> than others, (whether through
	language communication problems, or excessive nit-picking), and
	that dealing with this gracefully is just part of being in a large
	community.  In case of specific problems with specific people, or
	any questions, we hope that they will approach a portmgr member on
	IRC or by email.</para>

      <title>Disk Space</title>
      <para>
        Disk space is one of the most important requirements.
        Depending on the set of releases, architectures,
        and degree of completeness you want to mirror, a huge
        amount of disk space may be consumed. Also keep in mind
        that <emphasis>official</emphasis> mirrors are probably required to be
        complete. The web pages should
        always be mirrored completely. Also note that the
        numbers stated here are reflecting the current
        state (at &rel2.current;-RELEASE/&rel.current;-RELEASE). Further development and
        releases will only increase the required amount.
        Also make sure to keep some (ca. 10-20%) extra space
        around just to be sure.
        Here are some approximate figures:

      <title>Network Connection/Bandwidth</title>
      <para>
        Of course, you need to be connected to the Internet.
        The required bandwidth depends on your intended use
        of the mirror. If you just want to mirror some
        parts of FreeBSD for local use at your site/intranet,
        the demand may be much smaller than if you want to
        make the files publicly available.  If you intend
        to become an official mirror, the bandwidth required will be even higher.  We can only give rough
        estimates here:

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-system">
      <title>System Requirements, CPU, RAM</title>
      <para>
        One thing this depends on the expected number of clients,
        which is determined by the server's policy. It is
        also affected by the types of services you want to offer.
        Plain FTP or HTTP services may not require a huge
        amount of resources. Watch out if you provide
        rsync. This can have a huge
        impact on CPU and memory requirements as it is
        considered a memory hog.
        The following
        are just examples to give you a very rough hint.
      </para>
      <para>
        For a moderately visited site that offers
        <application>rsync</application>, you might
        consider a current CPU with around 800MHz - 1 GHz,
        and at least 512MB RAM. This is probably the
        minimum you want for an <emphasis>official</emphasis>
        site.
      </para>
      <para>
        For a frequently used site you definitely need
        more RAM (consider 2GB as a good start)
        and possibly more CPU, which could also mean
        that you need to go for a SMP system.
      </para>
      <para>
        You also want to consider a fast disk subsystem.
        Operations on the SVN repository require a fast
        disk subsystem (RAID is highly advised). A SCSI
        controller that has a cache of its own can also
        speed up things since most of these services incur a
        large number of small modifications to the disk.
      </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-services">
      <title>Services to offer</title>
      <para>
        Every mirror site is required to have a set of core services
        available. In addition to these required services, there are
        a number of optional services that
        server administrators may choose to offer.  This section explains
        which services you can provide and how to go about implementing them.
      </para>
      <sect3 xml:id="mirror-serv-ftp">
        <title>FTP (required for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          This is one of the most basic services, and
          it is required for each mirror offering public
          FTP distributions. FTP access must be
          anonymous, and no upload/download ratios
          are allowed (a ridiculous thing anyway).
          Upload capability is not required (and <emphasis>must</emphasis>
          never be allowed for the FreeBSD file space).
          Also the FreeBSD archive should be available under
          the path <filename>/pub/FreeBSD</filename>.

        <para>
          There is a lot of software available which
          can be set up to allow anonymous FTP

          are among the most commonly used FTPds.
          The others do not have a large userbase among mirror sites.  One
          thing to consider is that you may need flexibility in limiting
          how many simultaneous connections are allowed, thus limiting how
          much network bandwidth and system resources are consumed.

      </sect3>
      <sect3 xml:id="mirror-serv-rsync">
        <title>Rsync (optional for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          <application>Rsync</application> is often offered for access to the
          contents of the FTP area of FreeBSD, so other mirror sites can use your system as their source.  The
          protocol is different from FTP in many ways.
          It is much more
          bandwidth friendly, as only differences between files
          are transferred instead of whole files when they change.
          <application>Rsync</application> does require a significant amount of memory for
          each instance. The size depends on the size of
          the synced module in terms of the number of directories and
          files. <application>Rsync</application> can use <command>rsh</command> and
          <command>ssh</command> (now default) as a transport,
          or use its own protocol for stand-alone access
          (this is the preferred method for public rsync servers).
          Authentication, connection limits, and other restrictions
          may be applied. There is just one software package
          available:</para>

        <title>HTTP (required for web pages, optional for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          If you want to offer the FreeBSD web pages, you will need
          to install a web server.
          You may optionally offer the FTP fileset via HTTP.
          The choice of web server software is left up to the mirror administrator.
          Some of the most popular choices are:</para>

                Unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
                connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
                connections. Although, it should provide considerably great
                performance for purely static content.</para>

    <title>How to Mirror FreeBSD</title>
    <para>
      Ok, now you know the requirements and how to offer
      the services, but not how to get it. :-)
      This section explains how to actually mirror
      the various parts of FreeBSD, what tools to use,
      and where to mirror from.

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-ftp-rsync">
    <title>Mirroring the FTP site</title>
      <para>
        The FTP area is the largest amount of data that
        needs to be mirrored. It includes the <emphasis>distribution
        sets</emphasis> required for network installation, the
        <emphasis>branches</emphasis> which are actually snapshots
        of checked-out source trees, the <emphasis>ISO Images</emphasis>
        to write CD-ROMs with the installation distribution,
        a live file system, and a snapshot of the ports tree. All of
        course for various FreeBSD versions, and various architectures.
      </para>
        <para>
          The best way to mirror the FTP area is <application>rsync</application>.
          You can install the port <package>net/rsync</package> and then use
          rsync to sync with your upstream host.
          <application>rsync</application> is already mentioned
          in <xref linkend="mirror-serv-rsync"/>.
          Since <application>rsync</application> access is not
          required, your preferred upstream site may not allow it.
          You may need to hunt around a little bit to find a site
          that allows <application>rsync</application> access.</para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Since the number of <application>rsync</application>
              clients will have a significant impact on the server
              machine, most admins impose limitations on their
              server. For a mirror, you should ask the site maintainer
              you are syncing from about their policy, and maybe
              an exception for your host (since you are a mirror).
            </para>
          </note>
          <para>A command line to mirror FreeBSD might look like:</para>

     <para>Due to very high requirements of bandwidth, storage and

       mirrors of packages.  For sites with lots of machines, it might
       be advantagous to run a caching HTTP proxy for the &man.pkg.8;
       process.  Alternatively specific packages and their dependencies
       can be fetched by running something like the following:</para>

        There are mirrors with no <emphasis>CC</emphasis> part.
        These are the mirror sites that are very well connected and
        allow a large number of concurrent users.
        <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> is actually two machines, one currently
        located in Denmark and the other in the United States.
        It is <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> a master site and should never be
        used to mirror from.  Lots of online documentation leads
        <quote>interactive</quote>users to
        <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> so automated mirroring
        systems should find a different machine to mirror from.
      </para>
      <para>
        Additionally there exists a hierarchy of mirrors, which
        is described in terms of <emphasis>tiers</emphasis>.
        The master sites are not referred to but can be
        described as <emphasis>Tier-0</emphasis>. Mirrors
        that mirror from these sites can be considered
        <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>, mirrors of <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>-mirrors,
        are <emphasis>Tier-2</emphasis>, etc.
        Official sites are encouraged to be of a low <emphasis>tier</emphasis>,
        but the lower the tier the higher the requirements in
        terms as described in <xref linkend="mirror-requirements"/>.
        Also access to low-tier-mirrors may be restricted, and
        access to master sites is definitely restricted.
        The <emphasis>tier</emphasis>-hierarchy is not reflected
        by DNS and generally not documented anywhere except
        for the master sites. However, official mirrors with low numbers
        like 1-4, are usually <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>
        (this is just a rough hint, and there is no rule).

        It is not so easy to state requirements for all
        official mirrors, since the project is sort of
        tolerant here. It is more easy to say,
        what <emphasis>official tier-1 mirrors</emphasis>

        can consider this a big <emphasis>should</emphasis>.</para>

      </para>
      <important>
        <para>It is <emphasis>very</emphasis> important for a hub administrator, especially
          Tier-1 hub admins, to check the
          <link xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/">release schedule</link>
          for the next FreeBSD release. This is important because it will tell you when the
          next release is scheduled
          to come out, and thus giving you time to prepare for the big spike of traffic which follows it.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is also important that hub administrators try to keep their mirrors as up-to-date as
          possible (again, even more crucial for Tier-1 mirrors). If Mirror1 does not update for a
          while, lower tier mirrors will begin to mirror old data from Mirror1 and thus begins
          a downward spiral... Keep your mirrors up to date!

        An interesting question, especially, since the state
        of being official comes with some benefits, like a much

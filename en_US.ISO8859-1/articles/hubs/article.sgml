      <title>Disk Space</title>
      <para>
        Disk space is one of the most important requirements.
        Depending on the set of releases, architectures,
        and degree of completeness you want to mirror, a huge
        amount of disk space may be consumed. Also keep in mind
        that <emphasis>official</emphasis> mirrors are probably required to be
        complete. The CVS repository and the web pages should
        always be mirrored completely. Also note that the
        numbers stated here are reflecting the current
        state (at &rel2.current;-RELEASE/&rel.current;-RELEASE). Further development and
        releases will only increase the required amount.
        Also make sure to keep some (ca. 10-20%) extra space
        around just to be sure.
        Here are some approximate figures:

    <sect2 id="mirror-bandwidth">
      <title>Network Connection/Bandwidth</title>
      <para>
        Of course, you need to be connected to the Internet.
        The required bandwidth depends on your intended use
        of the mirror. If you just want to mirror some
        parts of FreeBSD for local use at your site/intranet,
        the demand may be much smaller than if you want to
        make the files publicly available.  If you intend
        to become an official mirror, the bandwidth required will be even higher.  We can only give rough
        estimates here:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem><para>Local site, no public access: basically no minimum,
           but &lt; 2 Mbps could make syncing too slow.</para></listitem>

         <listitem><para>Official site: &gt; 100 Mbps is recommended, and your host
           should be connected as close as possible to your border router.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="mirror-system">
      <title>System Requirements, CPU, RAM</title>
      <para>
        One thing this depends on the expected number of clients,
        which is determined by the server's policy. It is
        also affected by the types of services you want to offer.
        Plain FTP or HTTP services may not require a huge
        amount of resources. Watch out if you provide
        CVSup, rsync or even AnonCVS. This can have a huge
        impact on CPU and memory requirements. Especially
        rsync is considered a memory hog, and CVSup does
        indeed consume some CPU. For AnonCVS it might
        be a nice idea to set up a memory resident file system (MFS) of at least
        300 MB, so you need to take this into account
        for your memory requirements. The following
        are just examples to give you a very rough hint.
      </para>
      <para>
        For a moderately visited site that offers
        <application>Rsync</application>, you might
        consider a current CPU with around 800MHz - 1 GHz,
        and at least 512MB RAM. This is probably the
        minimum you want for an <emphasis>official</emphasis>
        site.
      </para>
      <para>
        For a frequently used site you definitely need
        more RAM (consider 2GB as a good start)
        and possibly more CPU, which could also mean
        that you need to go for a SMP system.
      </para>
      <para>
        You also want to consider a fast disk subsystem.
        Operations on the CVS repository require a fast
        disk subsystem (RAID is highly advised). A SCSI
        controller that has a cache of its own can also
        speed up things since most of these services incur a
        large number of small modifications to the disk.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="mirror-services">
      <title>Services to offer</title>
      <para>
        Every mirror site is required to have a set of core services
        available. In addition to these required services, there are
        a number of optional services that
        server administrators may choose to offer.  This section explains
        which services you can provide and how to go about implementing them.
      </para>
      <sect3 id="mirror-serv-ftp">
        <title>FTP (required for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          This is one of the most basic services, and
          it is required for each mirror offering public
          FTP distributions. FTP access must be
          anonymous, and no upload/download ratios
          are allowed (a ridiculous thing anyway).
          Upload capability is not required (and <emphasis>must</emphasis>
          never be allowed for the FreeBSD file space).
          Also the FreeBSD archive should be available under
          the path <filename>/pub/FreeBSD</filename>.
        </para>
        <para>
          There is a lot of software available which
          can be set up to allow anonymous FTP
          (in alphabetical order).</para>

                If you do choose to use this software be sure to
                keep it up to date.

          <para>FreeBSD's <application>ftpd</application>, <application>proftpd</application>,
          <application>wu-ftpd</application> and maybe <application>ncftpd</application>
          are among the most commonly used FTPds.
          The others do not have a large userbase among mirror sites.  One
          thing to consider is that you may need flexibility in limiting
          how many simultaneous connections are allowed, thus limiting how
          much network bandwidth and system resources are consumed.
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="mirror-serv-rsync">
        <title>Rsync (optional for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          <application>Rsync</application> is often offered for access to the
          contents of the FTP area of FreeBSD, so other mirror sites can use your system as their source.  The
          protocol is different from FTP in many ways.
          It is much more
          bandwidth friendly, as only differences between files
          are transferred instead of whole files when they change.
          <application>Rsync</application> does require a significant amount of memory for
          each instance. The size depends on the size of
          the synced module in terms of the number of directories and
          files. <application>Rsync</application> can use <command>rsh</command> and
          <command>ssh</command> (now default) as a transport,
          or use its own protocol for stand-alone access
          (this is the preferred method for public rsync servers).
          Authentication, connection limits, and other restrictions
          may be applied. There is just one software package
          available:</para>

      <sect3 id="mirror-serv-http">
        <title>HTTP (required for web pages, optional for FTP fileset)</title>
        <para>
          If you want to offer the FreeBSD web pages, you will need
          to install a web server.
          You may optionally offer the FTP fileset via HTTP.
          The choice of web server software is left up to the mirror administrator.
          Some of the most popular choices are:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><filename role="package">www/apache13</filename>:
                <application>Apache</application> is the most widely
                deployed web server on the Internet. It is used
                extensively by the FreeBSD Project. You may also wish to
                use the next generation of the
                <application>Apache</application> web server, available
                in the ports collection as <filename

            <listitem>
              <para><filename role="package">www/thttpd</filename>:
                If you are going to be serving a large amount of static content
                you may find that using an application such as thttpd is more
                efficient than <application>Apache</application>. It is
                optimized for excellent performance on FreeBSD.</para>

              <para><filename role="package">www/boa</filename>:

                <application>thttpd</application> and
                <application>Apache</application>. It should provide
                considerably better performance than
                <application>Apache</application> for purely static
                content. It does not, at the time of this writing,
                contain the same set of optimizations for FreeBSD that
                are found in <application>thttpd</application>.</para>

      <sect3 id="mirror-serv-cvsup">
        <title>CVSup (desired for CVS repository)</title>
        <para>
          <application>CVSup</application> is a very efficient way of distributing files.
          It works similar to <application>rsync</application>, but was specially designed for
          use with CVS repositories. If you want to offer the
          FreeBSD CVS repository, you really want to consider
          offering it via <application>CVSup</application>. It is possible to offer
          the CVS repository via <application>AnonCVS</application>, FTP,
          <application>rsync</application> or HTTP, but
          people would benefit much more from <application>CVSup</application> access.
          <application>CVSup</application> was developed by &a.jdp;.
          It is a bit tricky to install on non-FreeBSD platforms,
          since it is written in Modula-3 and therefore requires
          a Modula-3 environment. John Polstra has built a
          stripped down version of M3 that is sufficient to
          run <application>CVSup</application>, and can be installed much easier.
          See <ulink url="http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/ezm3/">Ezm3</ulink>

        <para>
          It is possible to use <application>CVSup</application> to offer
          any kind of fileset, not just CVS repositories,
          but configuration can be complex.
          <application>CVSup</application> is known to eat some CPU on both the server and the
          client, since it needs to compare lots of files.

      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="mirror-anoncvs">
        <title>AnonCVS (optional for CVS repository)</title>
        <para>
          If you have the CVS repository, you may want to offer
          anonymous CVS access. A short warning first:
          There is not much demand for it,
          it requires some experience, and you need to know
          what you are doing.
        </para>
        <para>
          Generally there are two ways
          to access a CVS repository remotely: via
          <emphasis>pserver</emphasis> or via <command>ssh</command>
          (we do not consider <command>rsh</command>).
          For anonymous access, <emphasis>pserver</emphasis> is
          very well suited, but some still offer <command>ssh</command>
          access as well. There is a custom crafted
          <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/development/FreeBSD-CVS/anoncvs.shar">wrapper</ulink>
          in the CVS repository, to be used as a login-shell for the
          anonymous ssh account. It does a chroot, and therefore
          requires the CVS repository to be available under the
          anonymous user's home-directory.   This may not be possible
          for all sites. If you just offer <emphasis>pserver</emphasis>
          this restriction does not apply, but you may run with
          more security risks. You do not need to install any special
          software, since &man.cvs.1; comes with
          FreeBSD. You need to enable access via <command>inetd</command>,
          so add an entry into your <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>
          like this:</para>
          <programlisting>
cvspserver stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/cvs cvs -f -l -R -T /anoncvstmp --allow-root=/home/ncvs pserver
          </programlisting>
          <para>See the manpage for details of the options. Also see the CVS <emphasis>info</emphasis>
          page about additional ways to make sure access is read-only.
          It is advised that you create an unprivileged account,
          preferably called <username>anoncvs</username>.
          Also you need to create a file <filename>passwd</filename>
          in your <filename>/home/ncvs/CVSROOT</filename> and assign a
          CVS password (empty or <literal>anoncvs</literal>) to that user.
          The directory <filename>/anoncvstmp</filename> is a special
          purpose memory based file system. It is not required but
          advised since &man.cvs.1; creates a shadow directory
          structure in your <filename>/tmp</filename> which is
          not used after the operation but slows things
          dramatically if real disk operations are required.
          Here is an excerpt from <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>,
          how to set up such a MFS:</para>
          <programlisting>
/dev/da0s1b /anoncvstmp mfs rw,-s=786432,-b=4096,-f=512,-i=560,-c=3,-m=0,nosuid 0 0
          </programlisting>
          <para>This is (of course) tuned a lot, and was suggested by &a.jdp;.

          <para><filename role="package">ftp/mirror</filename> was very popular, but seemed
          to have some drawbacks, as it is written in &man.perl.1;,
          and had real problems with mirroring large
          directories like a FreeBSD site. There are rumors that
          the current version has fixed this by allowing
          a different algorithm for comparing
          the directory structure to be specified.

          In general FTP is not really good for mirroring.  It transfers
          the whole file if it has changed, and does
          not create a single data stream which would benefit from
          a large TCP congestion window.

        <para>
          A better way to mirror the FTP area is <application>rsync</application>.
          You can install the port <filename role="package">net/rsync</filename> and then use
          rsync to sync with your upstream host.
          <application>rsync</application> is already mentioned
          in <xref linkend="mirror-serv-rsync">.
          Since <application>rsync</application> access is not
          required, your preferred upstream site may not allow it.
          You may need to hunt around a little bit to find a site
          that allows <application>rsync</application> access.</para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Since the number of <application>rsync</application>
              clients will have a significant impact on the server
              machine, most admins impose limitations on their
              server. For a mirror, you should ask the site maintainer
              you are syncing from about their policy, and maybe
              an exception for your host (since you are a mirror).
            </para>

          <para>A command line to mirror FreeBSD might look like:</para>
          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>rsync -vaz --delete ftp4.de.FreeBSD.org::FreeBSD/ /pub/FreeBSD/</userinput>
          </screen>

          about the various options to be used with rsync.
		  If you sync the whole module (unlike subdirectories),
		  be aware that the module-directory (here "FreeBSD")
		  will not be created, so you cannot omit the target directory.
          Also you might
          want to set up a script framework that calls such a command
          via &man.cron.8;.

    <sect2 id="mirror-where-organization">
      <title>A few words about the organization</title>

        Mirrors are organized by country. All
        official mirrors have a DNS entry of the form
        <hostid role="fqdn">ftpN.CC.FreeBSD.org</hostid>.
        <emphasis>CC</emphasis> (i.e. country code) is the
        <emphasis>top level domain</emphasis> (TLD)
        of the country where this mirror is located.
        <emphasis>N</emphasis> is a number,
        telling that the host would be the <emphasis>Nth</emphasis>
        mirror in that country.
        (Same applies to <hostid>cvsupN.CC.FreeBSD.org</hostid>,
        <hostid>wwwN.CC.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, etc.)
        There are mirrors with no <emphasis>CC</emphasis> part.
        These are the mirror sites that are very well connected and
        allow a large number of concurrent users.
        <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> is actually two machines, one currently
        located in Denmark and the other in the United States.
        It is <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> a master site and should never be
        used to mirror from.  Lots of online documentation leads
        <quote>interactive</quote>users to
        <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> so automated mirroring
        systems should find a different machine to mirror from.

      <para>
        Additionally there exists a hierarchy of mirrors, which
        is described in terms of <emphasis>tiers</emphasis>.
        The master sites are not referred to but can be
        described as <emphasis>Tier-0</emphasis>. Mirrors
        that mirror from these sites can be considered
        <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>, mirrors of <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>-mirrors,
        are <emphasis>Tier-2</emphasis>, etc.
        Official sites are encouraged to be of a low <emphasis>tier</emphasis>,
        but the lower the tier the higher the requirements in
        terms as described in <xref linkend="mirror-requirements">.
        Also access to low-tier-mirrors may be restricted, and
        access to master sites is definitely restricted.
        The <emphasis>tier</emphasis>-hierarchy is not reflected
        by DNS and generally not documented anywhere except
        for the master sites. However, official mirrors with low numbers
        like 1-4, are usually <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>

      <para>So far to distinguish official mirrors.
      Official mirrors are not necessarily <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>-mirrors.
      However you probably will not find a <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>-mirror,
      that is not also official.

    <sect2 id="mirror-official-requirements">
      <title>Special Requirements for official (tier-1) mirrors</title>
      <para>
        It is not so easy to state requirements for all
        official mirrors, since the project is sort of
        tolerant here. It is more easy to say,
        what <emphasis>official tier-1 mirrors</emphasis>
        are required to. All other official mirrors
        can consider this a big <emphasis>should</emphasis>.</para>
        <note>
          <para>
            The following applies mainly to the FTP fileset,
            since a CVS repository should always be mirrored
            completely, and the web pages are a case of
            its own.
          </para>
        </note>
      <para>
        Tier-1 mirrors are required to:</para>

        <para>Furthermore, admins should be subscribed to the &a.hubs;.
        See <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">this link</ulink> for details, how to subscribe.
      </para>
      <important>
        <para>It is <emphasis>very</emphasis> important for a hub administrator, especially
          Tier-1 hub admins, to check the
          <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/">release schedule</ulink>
          for the next FreeBSD release. This is important because it will tell you when the
          next release is scheduled
          to come out, and thus giving you time to prepare for the big spike of traffic which follows it.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is also important that hub administrators try to keep their mirrors as up-to-date as
          possible (again, even more crucial for Tier-1 mirrors). If Mirror1 does not update for a
          while, lower tier mirrors will begin to mirror old data from Mirror1 and thus begins
          a downward spiral... Keep your mirrors up to date!

      <title>How to become official then?</title>
		<!--
      <para>
        An interesting question, especially, since the state
        of being official comes with some benefits, like a much
        higher bill from your ISP as more people will be using
        your site. Also it may be a key requirement to get access
        to a master site.
      </para>
      <para>
        Before applying, please consider (again) if
        another official mirror is really needed for
        your region. Check first with your zone administrator (<email>hostmaster@CC.FreeBSD.org</email>) or, if that fails, ask on the &a.hubs;.
      </para>
      <para>Ok, here is how to do it:</para>
      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>
            Get the mirror running in first place (maybe not
            using a master site, yet).

        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            If everything works so far, contact the DNS administrator responsible
            for your region/country, and ask for a DNS entry for your
            site. The admin should able to be contacted via
            <email>hostmaster@CC.FreeBSD.org</email>, where
            <emphasis>CC</emphasis> is your country code/TLD.
            Your DNS entry will be as described

          <para>
            If there is no subdomain set up for your

            or you can try the &a.hubs; first.

            Whoever helps you get an official name should send email

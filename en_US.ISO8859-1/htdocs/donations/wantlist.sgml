    <p>This page lists various developer hardware needs.  If you are
      interested in supporting the FreeBSD Project, you might consider
      donating some piece of hardware on this list to the Project.</p>

    <p>We provide the FreeBSD username of the developer who needs a
      resource, the country they are in (for shipping purposes), the
      equipment they desire, and the use to which that equipment will
      be put.</p>

    <p>For information on tax deductions and process, please see the
      information on the main <a href="index.html#donating">FreeBSD
      Donation Liaison office</a> page.</p>

    <p>If you would like to donate something on this list, please
      contact donations@FreeBSD.org.</p>

    <p>On a general note, we need a variety of Sparc64 machines for
      testing and improving our Sparc port.  Even small, old (or
      new!) Sparc64 machines are perfectly usable.  No matter which
      country you're in, we almost certainly have someone local who
      could use it.</p>

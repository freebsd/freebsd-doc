<p>In accordance with its <a href="charter.html">Charter</a>, the
  Ports Management Team has adopted certain policies to try to meet
  each of its goals.</p>

<p><a href="policies_eol.html">EOL Policies of Ports and Ports
  Intrastructure</a></p>

<h3>Assure The Integrity Of The Ports Collection</h3>

<p>To help assure the integrity of the Ports Collection, portmgr
  acts as sole committer for certain files that are integral to it,
  such as <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt>.  Since the ports tree is not
  branched (unlike some of the other BSD projects), any fatal
  error in these files will be quickly picked up by the many
  users who run automated updates of their ports.</p>

<p>portmgr also runs periodic builds of proposed large changes to the
  Ports Collection on a dedicated area of the automated
  <a href="https://pkg-status.freebsd.org">ports building cluster</a>.
  These are termed experimental builds (often referred to as "exp-runs").
  Examples of changes that should be tested here before committing
  include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>changes to <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt></p></li>
  <li><p>changes to packages with many dependencies, including
	X11 servers, GNOME, KDE, autotools, and so forth</p></li>
  <li><p>changes that change the "accepted best practice" for
	ports Makefiles, such as definitions or usage of common make
        variables (or <tt>Makevar</tt>s). (e.g., consolidation of
	various implementations of USE_*, WITH_*, and so forth)</p></li>
  <li><p>large changes to the repository (such as when an existing port category
	is divided up)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any large-scale
  failures that might be caused by any of the above need to be caught
  first before a large number of user installations are affected.</p>

<p>At other times, especially during the preparations for a new release,
  there are <a href="policies_committing.html">
  other restrictions on when commits are allowed</a>.</p>

<p>portmgr reserves the right to act as final arbiter of other
  commits in certain unusual cases, such as: commits that in their
  opinion destabilize the Ports Collection; violate the
  Principle Of Least Astonishment for FreeBSD's users; or in cases
  of inter-committer disputes that cannot be solved among the
  committers themselves.</p>

<h3>Maintain The Automated Ports Building Cluster</h3>

<p>portmgr maintains a set of machines that automatically build
  packages on combinations of FreeBSD source tree versus CPU
  architecture (in our terminology, <tt>build environments</tt> or
  <tt>buildenv</tt>s).  Where license distribution permits, the
  resulting packages are regularly uploaded to the main FTP mirror
  as the "new latest package" so that they are available for download
  by FreeBSD users.  Port build failures are reported to the responsible
  maintainers and/or committers for the appropriate corrective action.</p>

<p>In some cases ports may become broken by changes to the FreeBSD base
 system (src/ tree).  In such a case, the Ports Management Team expects
 the responsible Source Committer to develop fixes to the affected ports,
 in consultation with the relevant port maintainers.</p>

<h3>Work With The FreeBSD Security Team</h3>

<!-- nothing specific; the header is left to cross-reference the charter -->

<h3>Work with FreeBSD Ports and Documentation Committers</h3>

<p>portmgr will attempt to help keep the
  <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/index.html">
  FreeBSD Porter's Handbook</a> up to date with what it believes to be
  the "best practices" for individual ports.</p>

<p>(The intent is not just to lay down 'rules' but to say 'here is
  why something that we advocate as The Right Thing in the ports
  Makefiles is done.'  In particular, there are a number of
  "edge cases" that <tt>bsd.*.mk</tt> has some very convoluted
  code to handle -- such as ensuring that ports can be installed
  from CD-ROM, over NFS, and so forth -- and failing to understand
  these issues can lead to maintainers using shortcuts that will
  not work in these edge cases.)</p>

<p>portmgr is not the sole owner of the Porter's Handbook, as it is
  actually in the <tt>doc/</tt> tree.  We welcome PR submitters and
  <tt>doc</tt> committers to work on it to add documentation that helps
  to clarify existing practice.  However, we would like to request,
  as a courtesy, the right to review any changes that would seem to
  change existing practice.</p>

<p>In addition, there has been recent discussion about creating a
  "Rights And Responsibilities of FreeBSD Ports Maintainers and Committers"
  document.  portmgr supports this effort and looks forward to being
  able to review any drafts.</p>

<p>portmgr also is responsible for certain other documentation such as
  the ports-specific portions of the
  <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/ports.html">
  Committer's Guide</a> and the
  <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributing/ports-contributing.html">
    Contributing to FreeBSD Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Respect The Legal Rights Of Authors Whose Works Are Installed Via
  The Ports Collection</h3>

<p>To the extent possible with a volunteer project, portmgr will work
  to ensure that the legal rights of authors whose works are installed
  via the Ports Collection are respected.  This includes making sure that
  the appropriate entries are made to <tt>ports/LEGAL</tt> and to
  the <tt>makevars</tt> that control package building and thus automated
  distribution of binaries.</p>

<p>In rare cases this may also require removing a port and all distfiles
  and binaries if the original author demands it.</p>

<p>portmgr asks our volunteer committers to carefully consider authors'
  licensing restrictions when committing new ports, since it is infeasible
  for the members of portmgr to do so themselves due to the huge number
  of ports.</p>

<h3>Act As Arbiter Of First Resort For Disputes Between FreeBSD
  Community Members Such As Maintainers And Committers</h3>

<p>portmgr encourages members of the FreeBSD community to work
  together in accordance with the principles set out in the
  Committer's Guide.  In case of disputes, it reserves the right
  to abitrate, subject to review by the Core Team.</p>

<h3>Manage Commit Access To The Ports Tree</h3>

<p>The FreeBSD Core Team has delegated the responsibility to manage
  commit access to the <tt>ports/</tt> tree to portmgr.  Core
  reviews granting and revocation of commit bits and has final
  authority over all the entire FreeBSD repositories.</p>

<p>New Ports Committers are proposed by an existing Ports Committer
  who wishes to act as a mentor.  The proposals should include a brief
  summary of the history of contributions made by the proposed new
  committer such as number of PRs submitted, number of ports currently
  maintained, and existing commit bits in other trees, if any.</p>

<p>In its votes the team will consider that history as well as any other
  relevant factors.  The results of the votes are made available to
  the FreeBSD developer community.</p>

<p>In accordance with practice elsewhere in the project, inactive
  Ports Committers are
  <a href="policies_contributors.html#commit_privileges">
  periodically contacted</a> to enquire about
  their status and interest in continuing to work with the ports tree.
  Committers who do not respond to such email, or who respond in the
  negative, have their commit bits reclaimed for safekeeping.
  Currently, this period is one year.</p>

<p>In unusual cases it may become necessary to remove Ports Committers
  for other reasons.  This will only be done after serious deliberation,
  and is subject to review by Core.</p>

<h3>Establish Guidelines And Policies Governing The Rights And
  Responsibilities Of Ports Committers And Maintainers</h3>

<p>portmgr has the responsibility to establish guidelines and policies
  governing the rights and responsibilities of Ports Committers and
  maintainers, such as expected standards of maintainership, conditions
  under which maintainers may be overridden or removed, and other
  policies.</p>

<p>To ensure that ports Problem Reports are handled in a timely
  manner, portmgr has established a guideline about how long a PR
  assigned to a committer may remain open before being eligible for
  being committed by another committer via a
  <a href="policies_contributors.html#pr_timeout">"maintainer timeout"</a>.
  This time period applies to such things as updates that do not require
  a regression run; for other updates, please contact portmgr directly.
  The time period does not count ports freezes and
  generally recognized holidays.</p>

<p>In addition, to ensure that ports are maintained in a timely
  fashion, portmgr has established a guideline about how long a port
  maintainer may be inactive before
  <a href="policies_contributors.html#maintainer_reset">
  forfeiting maintainership</a>.
  "inactive" is not interpreted strictly, but is intended to encompass
  such things as unresolved open PRs, commits made by others via
  maintainer timeouts, and unresolved build problems.</p>

<p>The intent of these policies is not to assign punishment or blame,
  but to reflect the fact that the software installed by the Ports
  Collection undergoes rapid development that is outside FreeBSD's
  control.  Part of the responsibility that a ports maintainer
  accepts is to try to keep a port working and as up-to-date as
  feasible.  It is unfair to our users to let unfixed problems
  languish and stale versions remain.  However, we also recognize
  that all of our maintainers and committers are volunteers just
  as we are, and that as with any volunteer project, it is easy to
  overcommit, or lose interest in a particular port.</p>

<p>Maintainers and committers who feel overcommitted or have lost
  interest in any particular port should feel free to ask for new
  volunteers and/or reassignment of the port back to the general
  pool.  Not only will this help keep the Ports Collection current,
  but hopefully will help prevent volunteer burnout.</p>

<h3>Help Prioritize Future Directions For The Overall Ports Collection</h3>

<p>portmgr recognizes that the development and evolution of the Ports
  Collection is primarily driven by the work of community members.
  However, due to the unbranched nature of the Ports Collection,
  it is sometimes necessary to coordinate, or even choose among, any
  proposed changes.</p>

<p>To some extent this involves choosing which patches are adopted
  for testing on the build cluster, but it also involves such issues
  as working to build consensus over architectural decisions,
  creating lists of "interesting projects", and so forth.</p>

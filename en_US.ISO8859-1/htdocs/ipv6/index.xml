      on-going IPv6 development in the FreeBSD community, including
      participation in IPv6 World Day 2011.

    <h2>IPv6 in &os;</h2>
    <p>&os; is a widely used, open source operating system whose network stack
      has been the foundation for decades of research, as well as a reference
      implementation of IPv6 (developed by the
      <a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME</a> project).
      &os; first shipped IPv6 support in March 2000 as part of &os;
      <a href="&base;/releases/">4.0-Release</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>IPv6 and the &os; Project</h2>
    <p>The &os; Project has been an early adopter and active participant in
      the IPv6 community.  With the help of the community, we have been
       serving releases from IPv6-enabled servers since May 2003 and &os;'s
       website, mailing lists, and developer infrastructure have been IPv6
       enabled since 2007.
    </p>

    <p>&os; is used by critical Internet infrastructure such as root name
      servers, routers, firewalls and some of the world's busiest and most
      reliable web sites as well as embedded into many products all in the
      need for the best IPv6 support.  To read more about some companies
      using the &os; operating system in their products, see the
      <a href="https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/testimonials.shtml">&os;
      Foundation Testimonials</a> page.

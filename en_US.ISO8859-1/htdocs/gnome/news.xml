	  <p>The FreeBSD GNOME team proudly presents GNOME 3.18 for
	    FreeBSD.</p>

	  <p>This update does not contain the glib and gtk c++ bindings
	    which will be done in a another update due to the requirement
	    on c++11 and the amount of fallout this probably will give.</p>

	  <p>GDM is still at version 3.16 due to some issues.</p>

	  <p>Bump mate-themes to use the gtk 3.18 version of the themes.</p>

	  <p>Presenting GNOME 2.30.1 for FreeBSD. The official release
	    notes for this release can be found at
	    <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/</a></p>

	  <p>This release brings initial PackageKit support, Upower
	    (replaces power management part of hal), cuse4bsd
	    integration with HAL and cheese, and a faster
	    Evolution.</p>

	  <p>Sadly GNOME 2.30.x will be the last release with FreeBSD
	    6.X support.  This will also be the last of the 2.x
	    releases.  The next release will be the highly-anticipated
	    GNOME 3.0 which will bring with it a new UI
	    experience.</p>

	  <p>Currently, there are a few bugs with GNOME 2.30 that may
	    be of note for our users.  Be sure to consult the 2.30
	    upgrade FAQ at
	    <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq230.html">https://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq230.html></a>
	    for specific upgrading instructions, and the up-to-date
	    list of known issues.</p>

	  <p>This release features commits by: avl, ahze, bland,
	    marcus, mezz and myself.</p>

	  <p>The FreeBSD GNOME Team would like to thank Anders F
	    Bjorklund for doing the initial packagekit porting.</p>

	  <p>Presenting GNOME 2.28.1 for FreeBSD. The official release
	    notes for this release can be found at
	    <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/</a>.
	    Officially, this is mostly a polishing release in
	    preparation for GNOME 3.0 due in about a year.</p>

	  <p>On the FreeBSD front, though, a lot went into this
	    release.  Major thanks goes to kwm and avl who did a lot
	    of the porting work for this release.  In particular, kwm
	    brought in Evolution MAPI support for better Microsoft
	    Exchange integration.  Avl made sure that the new gobject
	    introspection repository ports were nicely
	    compartmentalized so that large dependencies aren't
	    brought in wholesale.</p>

	  <p>But, every GNOME team member (ahze, avl, bland, kwm,
	    mezz, and myself) contributed to this release.</p>

	  <p>Other major improvements include an updated HAL with
	    better volume probing code, ufsid integration, and support
	    for volume names containing spaces (big thanks to J.R.
	    Oldroyd); a new WebKit; updated AbiWord; an updated Gimp;
	    and a preview of the new GNOME Shell project (thanks to
	    Pawel Worach).</p>

	  <p>The FreeBSD GNOME Team would like to that the following
	    additional contributors to this release whose patches and
	    testing really helped make it a success:</p>

	  <p>
	    Andrius Morkunas
	    <br />

	    Dominique Goncalves
	    <br />

	    of GNOME 2.26.0 for FreeBSD. The official release notes
	    can be found at
	    <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.26/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.26/</a>.

	    On the FreeBSD front, we introduced a port of libxul 1.9
	    as an alternative for Firefox 2.0 as a Gecko provider.
	    Almost all of the Gecko consumers can make use of this
	    provider by setting:
	    <br />

	    WITH_GECKO=libxul
	    <br />

	    The GNOME 2.26 port was done by ahze, kwm, marcus, and
	    mezz with contributions by Joseph S. Atkinson, Peter Wemm,
	    Eric L. Chen, Martin Matuska, Craig Butler, and Pawel

	    On the FreeBSD front, this release introduces Fuse support
	    in HAL, adds multi-CPU support to libgtop, WebKit updates,
	    and fixes some long-standing seahorse and gnome-keyring
	    bugs.</p>

	    release notes can be found at
	    <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/</a>.

	    On the FreeBSD front, this release features an updated hal
	    port with support for video4linux devices, DRM (Direct
	    Rendering), and better support of removable media.  Work
	    is also underway to tie webkit more closely into GNOME. As
	    part of the GNOME 2.22 upgrade, GStreamer received a
	    rather large upgrade as well.  Be sure to consult UPDATING
	    on the proper steps to upgrade all of your GNOME
	    ports.</p>

	  <p>This release would not have been possible without the
	    contributions and testing efforts of the following people:
	    Pawel Worach, kan, edwin, Peter Ulrich Kruppa, J. W.
	    Ballantine, Yasuda Keisuke, and Andriy Gapon.</p>

	  <title>Announcing GNOME 2.20.1 for FreeBSD!</title>

	  <p>Presenting GNOME 2.20.1 and all related works for
	    FreeBSD.  The official GNOME 2.20 release notes can be
	    found at
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/">http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/</a>.
	    Beyond that, this update includes the new GIMP 2.4
	    (courtesy of ahze).</p>

	  <p>The GNOME 2.20 update also includes a huge change in the
	    FreeBSD GNOME hierarchy.  We are now using the more
	    standard DATADIR of ${PREFIX}/share rather than
	    ${PREFIX}/share/gnome.  The result is that fewer patches
	    and hacks are needed to port GNOME components to FreeBSD.
	    This will mean some user changes may be required, so be
	    sure to read /usr/ports/UPDATING for more details.</p>

	  <p>This release and the things we accomplished in it would
	    not have been possible without mezz's crazy idea to
	    collapse DATADIR, and his persistence to make it happen
	    successfully.  Ahze and pav also deserve thanks for their
	    work on porting modules and testing the whole ball of wax
	    on pointyhat (respectively).</p>

	  <title>GNOME 2.19.1 available for FreeBSD</title>

	  <p>GNOME forges ahead with the first release in the
	    development train that will become GNOME 2.20.  As always,
	    FreeBSD is right there with them.  Only we bring a twist.
	    This time around, we are doing yet another bit of
	    housekeeping, and dropping the "share/gnome" DATADIR.
	    This means that the FreeBSD GNOME installation will be
	    more like all the other GNOME distributions.  The net gain
	    is that porting new GNOME applications to FreeBSD should
	    be much easier with fewer hacks and patches.</p>

	  <p>At this point, the
	    <a href="&base;/gnome/docs/develfaq.html">MarcusCom tree</a>
	    is safe to use for most ports.  There is still quite a few
	    ports that still require conversion, and we will be
	    working on those in the weeks to come.  In particular, the
	    Desktop and all gnome2 meta-ports are safe; and
	    <a href="&base;/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21">Packages</a>

	  <p>GNOME 2.17.4 was
	    <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2006-December/msg00005.html">released</a>
	    just in time for Christmas.  The one new module that is

	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jamiemcc/tracker/">Tracker</a>.
	    As soon as the final set of new GNOME 2.18 modules is

	    Additionally, work has mostly been completed on a clean up
	    of the FreeBSD libgtop backend.  This means that

	  <title>FreeBSD backend committed to HAL git</title>

	  <p>After seven months of development by Jean-Yves Lefort and

	    for
	    <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</a>
	    was finally

	    upstream into the HAL git repository.  This means that
	    future releases of HAL will have FreeBSD support
	    out-of-the-box.  This is a major landmark in a project
	    that started on April 14, 2006 with the goal of bringing a
	    better desktop experience to FreeBSD users.</p>

	  <title>GNOME 2.16.1 Unleashed!</title>

	  <p>GNOME 2.16.1 is now available for FreeBSD, and it is in
	    the ports tree in time for FreeBSD 6.2 (no you are NOT
	    dreaming)! This is a first.  Usually the GNOME release
	    cycle has conflicted with the FreeBSD release cycle.
	    However, thanks to Kris and pointyhat, we were able to get
	    the major patch tested.  In addition to the core GNOME
	    ports, almost 500 ports were also touched to chase the
	    GNOME move from X11BASE to LOCALBASE and fix build
	    problems with the new freetype2.  The bulk of the move was
	    carried out by ahze, mezz, and pav, but it would not have
	    been possible without cooperation from the FreeBSD KDE
	    team who worked with us to make sure GNOME and KDE can
	    still coexist happily.  We would also like to send a shout
	    out to kris and pointyhat for putting up with multiple
	    test runs until we got something that was solid.</p>

	  <p>Back to GNOME 2.16. This release brings a huge amount of
	    new functionality to FreeBSD. Check out the standard
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/">release notes</a>
	    to get the official spiel from the GNOME camp.  But on top
	    of what you will read there, jylefort and marcus have
	    completed work on a port of HAL to FreeBSD.  This will
	    allow FreeBSD to take advantage of closer hardware
	    interaction such as auto-mounting CD-ROMs, USB drives, and
	    music players; auto-playing audio CDs; and managing laptop
	    power consumption.</p>

	  <p>Quite possibly the most functional GNOME release ever is
	    now available for FreeBSD. GNOME 2.16 features HAL support
	    for FreeBSD which allows FreeBSD users to take advantage
	    of automatic volume mounting, advanced power management,
	    and more.  In addition, many performance improvements have
	    gone into GNOME, and the eye candy has definitely been
	    improved.  Check out the full set of
	    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/">release notes</a>
	    for all of the new goodies.</p>

	  <p>Due to the fact that GNOME 2.16 will be the first GNOME
	    release for FreeBSD to live in LOCALBASE, and because we
	    are so close to the release of FreeBSD 6.2, GNOME 2.16
	    will not be committed to the ports tree until sometime in
	    November most likely.  In the meantime,

	  <p>...PREFIXes, that is.  That's right, GNOME is leaving its

	    ports) in LOCALBASE. This is being done as part of an
	    effort to collapse into one third-party package PREFIX as
	    X11R6 is no longer as relevant as it used to be.  All of
	    the work is happening in the
	    <a href="&base;/gnome/docs/develfaq.html">MarcusCom ports tree</a>,
	    so expect GNOME 2.16 under /usr/local.  The work is going
	    extremely well, and we expect to be fully moved and

	    This means that future updates will most likely not see a

	  <title>FreeBSD GNOME to drop FreeBSD 4.X support</title>

	  <p>Starting with GNOME 2.11, and continuing with the release
	    of 2.12 and beyond, the FreeBSD GNOME team will no longer
	    support the GNOME Desktop on FreeBSD 4.X.  Some of
	    lower-level components will be supported, however.
	    FreeBSD 4.X lacks many of the features needed for a modern
	    desktop, and there are now two stable 5.X releases with
	    6.0 around the corner.  If you haven't done so already,
	    now would be a good time to upgrade to 5.X or 6.0.</p>

	    give the FreeBSD GNOME team more time to do quality

	  <title>BSD# Project Formation</title>

	  <p>The BSD# Project has recently been formed on
	    <a href="http://forge.novell.com">Novell Forge</a>
	    and is devoted to porting and maintaining the Mono .NET
	    framework from Ximian on FreeBSD.  The Mono framework
	    consists of not only the Mono runtime environment and
	    compiler but the XSP webserver and Apache mod_mono for
	    handling ASP.NET applications, the IKVM Java virtual
	    machine for handling Java within the .NET framework, and
	    numerous data providers to access common library functions
	    in C# or integration with existing C libraries.  The
	    project is currently in it's early stages but has recently
	    finished ports for all the latest Mono packages
	    distributed by Ximian.  There is still much more work to
	    be done; from fixing threading issues in the runtime
	    environment, to wider testing of XSP and IKVM, to further
	    understanding the framework and how it all functions.
	    Those interested in Mono and the BSD# Project are asked to
	    visit the project's
	    <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?bsd-sharp">homepage</a>

	  <title>Mono .NET Framework Release 1.0.1</title>

	  <p>The BSD# Project is pleased to announce that the entire
	    Mono 1.0.1 .NET framework from Ximian has been ported for
	    FreeBSD and is ready for use.  In addition to an updated
	    port of the Mono runtime, ports for all the latest library
	    bindings, XSP and Apache mod_mono for ASP.NET, and the
	    IKVM Java VM for .NET have been made.  Please be aware
	    that due to changes in the latest Mono release and recent
	    changes to threading in the 5.X branch of FreeBSD, these
	    packages only work on 5.3-BETA versions and above.  These
	    ports are not currently available in the standard FreeBSD
	    ports tree at the moment as they require wider testing but
	    the intent is for them to be there soon.  Those interested
	    in Mono may use mono-merge script available from the
	    <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?bsd-sharp">BSD# Project</a>
	    to merge the project's ports tree with their own.</p>

	  <title>GNOME 2.3.1 desktop available for FreeBSD</title>

	  <p>It's a bit late, but here none the less.  For those
	    willing to live on the edge, the next installment of the
	    GNOME 2.3 development snapshot, code named "Daddy Walrus,"
	    has been ported.  This snapshot lacks three ports found in
	    the official GNOME distribution.  They are gnopernicus,
	    gnome-speech, and gnome-system-tools.  The latter is
	    missing because it does not fully work with FreeBSD, while
	    the two former components rely on festival, which is
	    broken on -CURRENT.  To help out with the testing, check
	    out the ``ports'' module per the instructions at
	    <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi">http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi</a>.

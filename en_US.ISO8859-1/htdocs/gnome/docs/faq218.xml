      <p><b>What is new in GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
      <p>Although the canonical summary of new features can be found at
        <a
	href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/notes/en/">http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/notes/en/</a>,
	some of the most exciting new features of GNOME &gnomever; are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Seahorse has been added to integrate OpenPGP with the
	  Desktop.</li>
        <li>Improved system monitoring with a cleaned up FreeBSD
	  backend for libgtop.</li>
	<li>Two new games: gnome-sudoku and glChess.</li>
	<li>Network support for many GNOME games.</li>
	<li>Lots of stability and performance improvements.</li>
      </ul>

      </li>

      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
      <p><b>How do I upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
      <p>The answer is much simpler than it has been in the past:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>To build GNOME &gnomever;, you need to obtain the latest
	    ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily accomplished with
	    <tt>portsnap(8)</tt> or <a
	    href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">CVSup</a>.  Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are
	    ready to go.  Then do the following:</p>
	  <pre>
# pkgdb -Ff
# portupgrade -a
	  </pre>


	  <p>Then you can run <tt>portupgrade(8)</tt> as you normally
	    would.  <b>NOTE:</b> it is recommended to run <b>portupgrade
	    -a</b> to make sure you get all the necessary ports.</p>

	  <p>If you are a <tt>portmaster(8)</tt> user, make sure you have
	    least 1.9 version. Then do the following:</p>

	  <pre>
# portmaster -a
	  </pre>

	  <p>Then run portmaster normally.</p></li>
	</ol>
	</li>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
      <p><b>The upgrade failed; what do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
      <p>Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.  There are many possible
        valid GNOME configurations, and even more invalid starting points.  If the script fails,
	follow the instructions in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
	failure.</p>

      <p>The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues.  One simple way to resolve
        the problem is to remove the offending port, re-run <tt>portupgrade</tt> or <tt>portmaster</tt>, and then
	reinstall the port when the upgrade process is complete.</p>
      </li>

      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
      <p><b>List of GNOME &gnomever; problems and their solutions</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
      <p>Although GNOME &gnomever; is certainly the best release to date (of course), there are
	    a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the GNOME code and in its implementation
		within FreeBSD.  Some of the more visible issues are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><tt>hald-addon-storage</tt> consumes file descriptors
	  until it crashes.  This is a known bug in FreeBSD, and only
	  affects 6.0 and earlier and 5.5 and earlier.  Users on those
	  releases are encouraged to upgrade to FreeBSD 6.1 or
	  later.</li>
        <li><b>HAL</b> can not unmount and reset the da[0-9] devices
	  associated with USB disks when you manually detach them from
	  the system.  Manually removing a USB umass device while it
	  is mounted can result in a panic.  This is a known bug in FreeBSD.
	  See <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/103258">kern/103258</a> and <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/89102">kern/89102</a> for more details.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

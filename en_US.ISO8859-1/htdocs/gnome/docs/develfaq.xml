	<p><b>What are development versions of GNOME all about?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
	<p>The development versions are the packages released by the GNOME
	  project that will eventually become the stable (release) versions.
	  There are three working branches of GNOME development:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><b>STABLE</b> - The applications and libraries in the stable
	    branch are considered "release quality," and are the versions that
	    appear in the &os; ports tree.  The current stable version is
	    GNOME &gnomever;.</li>
	  <li><b>DEVELOPMENT</b> - In between stable releases are development
	    releases.  Traditionally, GNOME development releases have odd minor
	    numbers (e.g. 2.3, &gnomedevelver;, 3.(n*2)-1).  Development releases will
	    become stable releases, and move from alpha to beta quality during
	    their lifecycle.  The development releases need testing by &os;
	    users to minimize the number of surprises when the new stable
	    versions are committed to the &os; SVN tree. This document is
	    about the development branch.  At any time the development branch for &os;
	    might be based of a stable GNOME release.  However it will be tagged 
	    "development" here if it is the version that is work in progress by the &os;
	    GNOME team.  The current development branch for &os; is GNOME &gnomedevelver;.</li>
	  <li><b>GIT</b> - Often newer-than-new, the GIT master versions of GNOME
	    applications and libraries are alpha quality, or often completely
	    unbuildable.  The &os; GNOME project pays attention to, but
	    does not track the alpha quality code.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

<!-- Q2 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
	<p><b>Should I track GNOME development versions?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
	<p>If you are looking for a stable environment, absolutely not.  Please
	  only track the GNOME &gnomedevelver; branch if you wish to help identify bug
	  and improve the &os; GNOME project.  You will find little
	  sympathy if a development-quality GNOME application eats your
	  homework.</p>
      </li>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
	<p><b>How do I obtain the development versions of GNOME stuff?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
	<p><a href="mailto:marcus@FreeBSD.org">Marcus</a> maintains a
	  SVN repository where all the development versions of
	  the GNOME components for &os; are housed.  Instructions for
	  how to check out the development ports module and how to merge it
	  into the &os; ports tree reside on the entrance page to his SVN
	  repository.  Please read carefully the instructions at
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/marcuscom/">
	  http://www.marcuscom.com/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/marcuscom/</a>.</p>

	<p>During the development cycle, FreeBSD-specific caveats and
	  other useful information will be sent to <a
	  href="mailto:marcuscom-devel@marcuscom.com">
	  marcuscom-devel@marcuscom.com</a>.  If you are tracking
	  the GNOME development branch, you <b>must</b> <a
	  href="http://www.marcuscom.com/mailman/listinfo/marcuscom-devel">
	  subscribe</a> to this list.  You should also consider <a
	  href="https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-gnome">
	  subscribing</a> to <a
	  href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.</p>

	<p>In order to help with bug reports, be sure to add the following
	  to <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> so that gdb back traces contain
	  useful information:</p>
<pre>
WITH_DEBUG="yes"
</pre>
	<p>GNOME has an excellent guide for getting <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/GettingTraces">
	  useful back traces</a>.</p>

      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
	<p><b>How do I keep everything up-to-date and in sync?</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
	<p>The short answer is that you need to use the <tt>marcusmerge</tt>
	  script to merge the development tree with the &os; ports tree.
	  The <tt>marcusmerge</tt> script is available
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/downloads/marcusmerge">
	  here</a>, and a man page on using the script is available
	  <a href="http://www.marcuscom.com/marcusmerge.8.html">
	  here</a>.  This script will merge the development ports tree
	  into your main ports tree.  From there, you can use
	  <tt>portupgrade</tt> or <tt>portmaster</tt> to upgrade from
	  &gnomever; to &gnomedevelver; and stay up-to-date afterwards.</p>

	<p>The long answer is that keeping up-to-date with the GNOME
	  development branch is complicated.  Sometimes components change
	  in a way that makes <tt>portupgrade</tt> or <tt>portmaster</tt>
	  fail, or causes strange end results. If you plan to track the
	  development branch, it is a good idea to join the
	  <a href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-gnome">
	  freebsd-gnome</a> mailing list, as well as to join the
	  <em>#freebsd-gnome</em> IRC channel on FreeNode
	  (<tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>).</p>

	<p>If all of this sounds scary, or you need a desktop that
	  "Just Works," you should stick with the &gnomever; version that
	  is available in the &os; ports tree.</p>

      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
	<p><b>What should I do when something does not work?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
	<p>It depends.  If you think the problem is truly a bug with the
	  GNOME component, you can report a bug using <b>bug-buddy</b> or
	  the GNOME <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">Bugzilla</a>
	  interface.  If you think the problem lies in a &os; port, or
	  is FreeBSD-specific, send email to
	  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>,
	  or report the problem on the <em>#freebsd-gnome</em> IRC
	  channel on FreeNode.</p>

	<p>Please forward all relevant bug IDs to
	  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>
	  so we can keep track of known issues.  Thanks!</p>

	<p><b>How can I help with the development versions?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
	<p>Now that work on &gnomedevelver; has started, we need
	  people to install it, and test things.  If you are compiling
	  &gnomedevelver; by hand, be sure to build <a
	  href="&base;/gnome/docs/bugging.html">debugging symbols</a>.
	  Package users will have these symbols already.</p>

<!-- Q7 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q7"></a>
	<p><b>What is the current state of development GNOME on &os;?</b></p>
<!-- A7 -->
	<p>&gnomever; is the latest version that was merged into the &os; ports tree.  
	  Work is currently underway to make &gnomedevelver; stable.</p>

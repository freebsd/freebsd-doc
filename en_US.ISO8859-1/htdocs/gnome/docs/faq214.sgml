      <p><b>What is new in GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
      <p>Although the canonical summary of new features can be found at
        <a
	href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/">http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/</a>,
	some of the most exciting new features of GNOME &gnomever; are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>MUCH better performance</li>
	<li>Metacity now offers edge resistence</li>
	<li>Faster, more complete GEdit text editor</li>
	<li>Integrated gnome-screensaver with full XScreensaver module
	  support</li>
	<li>Better and more stable multimedia support</li>
      </ul>

      </li>

      <p><b>How do I upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
      <p>The answer is much simpler than it has been in the past:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>To build GNOME &gnomever;, you need to obtain the latest
	    ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily accomplished with
	    <tt>portsnap(8)</tt> or <a
	    href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">CVSup</a>.  Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are
	    ready to go.  Then do the following:</p>
	  <pre>
# pkgdb -Ff
# portupgrade -o net/avahi -f howl
# portupgrade -o x11/gnome-screensaver -f xscreensaver-gnome
	  </pre>

	  <p>Then you can run <tt>portupgrade(8)</tt> as you normally
	    would.  <b>NOTE:</b> it is recommended to run <b>portupgrade
	    -a</b> to make sure you get all the necessary ports.</p>
	  </ol>

	  <p>More detailed instructions are as follows:</p>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
      <p><b>The upgrade failed; what do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
      <p>Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.  There are many possible
        valid GNOME configurations, and even more invalid starting points.  If the script fails,
	follow the instructions in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
	failure.</p>

      <p>The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues.  One simple way to resolve
        the problem is to remove the offending port, re-run <tt>gnome_upgrade.sh</tt>, and then
	reinstall the port when the upgrade process is complete.  In
	order to avoid having to build everything again, you can pass
	the <tt>-restart</tt> flag to <tt>gnome_upgrade.sh</tt> to
	resume a failed build.</p>
      </li>

<!-- Q4 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
      <p><b>List of GNOME &gnomever; problems and their solutions</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
      <p>Although GNOME &gnomever; is certainly the best release to date (of course), there are
	    a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the GNOME code and in its implementation
		within FreeBSD.  Some of the more visible issues are:</p>

      <p>There are currently no known issues with GNOME
	&gnomever;.</p>

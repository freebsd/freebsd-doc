      <p><b>What is new in GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
      <p>Although the canonical summary of new features can be found at
	<a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/&gnomever;/">
	http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/&gnomever;/</a>,
	some of the most exciting new features of GNOME &gnomever; are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Initial PackageKit support. For updating from the GNOME.</li>
	<li>Upower replaces the power managment part of hal got ported.</li>
	<li>Cheese and hal got updated to work with cuse4bsd and webcamd.</li>
	<li>Evolution will load much faster now.</li>
	<li>A preview of the GNOME Shell environment has been added to
	  the ports tree (<tt>x11/gnome-shell</tt>).  This environment
	  is being slated to make its official appearance in GNOME 3.0.</li>
      </ul>

      </li>

      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
      <p><b>How do I upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
      <p>The answer is relatively simple:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>To build GNOME &gnomever;, you need to obtain the latest
	    ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily accomplished with
	    <tt>portsnap(8)</tt> or <a
	    href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">CVSup</a>.  Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are
	    ready to go.  Then do the following:</p>
	  <pre>
# pkgdb -Ff
(resolve all moved or deleted ports)

# portupgrade -R -x gnome-keyring -x libgnome-keyring gnome-keyring
# pkg_deinstall -fO gnome-keyring
# portinstall security/gnome-keyring

# portupgrade -aW
	  </pre>

	    <p><b>NOTE:</b> it is recommended to run <b>portupgrade
	    -a</b> to make sure you get all the necessary ports.  The
	    -W option simply makes things a bit faster by not doing a
	    <tt>make clean</tt> after each port build.</p>

	  <p>If you are a <tt>portmaster(8)</tt> user, make sure you have
	    least 1.9 version. Then do the following:</p>

	  <pre>
# pkg_delete -f "gnome-keyring-*"
# portmaster security/gnome-keyring
# portmaster -a
	  </pre></li>

	</ol>
	</li>

<!-- Q3 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
      <p><b>The upgrade failed; what do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
      <p>Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.  There are many possible
        valid GNOME configurations, and even more invalid starting points.  If the script fails,
	follow the instructions in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
	failure.</p>

      <p>The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues.  One simple way to resolve
        the problem is to remove the offending port, re-run <tt>portupgrade</tt> or <tt>portmaster</tt>, and then
	reinstall the port when the upgrade process is complete.</p>
      </li>

<!-- Q4 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q4"></a>
      <p><b>List of GNOME &gnomever; problems and their solutions</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
      <p>Although GNOME &gnomever; is certainly the best release to date (of course), there are
	    a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the GNOME code and in its implementation
		within FreeBSD.  Some of the more visible issues are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Clutter based applications like mutter and a number of
	  gnome-games, will crash when using Software Rasterizer rendering.
	  You can check it with <tt>glxinfo | grep render</tt>. A solution is
	  being worked on.</li>
	<li>Brasero has a bug that it crashes when creating new burn projects.
	  Premade iso burning works as expected.</li>
	<li>PackageKit where ported to FreeBSD. It does have some rough edges still.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
      <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
      <p><b>I have found a bug; whom should I alert?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
      <p>Please read the FreeBSD GNOME Project's
        <a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/bugging.html">documentation on reporting bugs</a>.

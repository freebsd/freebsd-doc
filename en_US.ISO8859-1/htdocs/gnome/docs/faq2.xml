	    <p><b>How do I get GNOME &gnomever; for FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME &gnomever; on FreeBSD.  One way is to use
	      <a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.  Before doing either installation, you should
		first familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
		<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/en/">
		release notes</a>.</p>

		<p><u>Install GNOME &gnomever; from packages.</u></p>

	    <p>To install GNOME &gnomever; from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg_add -r gnome2</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME &gnomever; packages from the
	      FreeBSD FTP site, and proceed to install them on your system.
	    </p>

	    <p>Up-to-date GNOME packages for i386 and amd64 for all supported
	      versions of FreeBSD are also available from the
	      <a href="#q21">GNOME Tinderbox</a>.</p>

	    <p>To build GNOME &gnomever;, you must first obtain the
	      latest ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily
	      accomplished with <tt>portsnap(8)</tt>
	      Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>You still need to <a href="#full-gnome">enable the
	      GNOME services</a> to run e.g. the graphical login
	      automatically on system startup.</p> </li>

<!-- Q Full-GNOME -->
	    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a
	    name="full-gnome"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I get the most out of GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A Full-GNOME -->
	    <p>In order to make the most of your new GNOME Desktop,
	      you will want to start all of the GNOME-related services
	      at boot-time.  If you wish to take full advantage of
	      GNOME, add the following to <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>:</p>

	    <pre>
gnome_enable="YES"
	    </pre>

	    <p>This will enable services such as GDM, HAL, D-BUS, and
	      Avahi on system startup.  If you do not want to run all
	      of these services, you should forget the
	      <em>gnome_enable</em> property, and manually enable the
	      services you want.</p>

	    <p>If you do not want to reboot immediately after the
	      installation, you can invoke the following commands:</p>

	    <pre>
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/dbus start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/avahi-daemon start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/avahi-dnsconfd start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/hald start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/gdm start
	    </pre>

	    <p>To start GNOME &gnomever; under X without using GDM,
	      add the following line to <tt>~/.xsession</tt> or
	      <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt>, as appropriate (see
	      <tt>startx(1)</tt>):</p>

	    <pre>
exec ck-launch-session gnome-session
	    </pre>
	    </li>

<!-- Q2 -->
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
	    <p><b>GNOME &gnomever; is failing to build from ports.  What do
	      I do?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
	    <p>The majority of GNOME &gnomever; compilation problems can be solved
	      by making sure all the necessary GNOME &gnomever; components are
	      <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a>.</p>

		<p><u>Updating solves most problems</u></p>

		<p>If you have not yet followed <a href="#q6">FAQ #6</a>,
		  do so, as it will most likely fix the problem you are
		  reading this document to solve.</p>

		<p>Please follow <a href="#q6">FAQ #6</a>.  If you have not
		  done so, and you ask for help, you will be told to follow
		  FAQ #6.</p>

	    <p>In general, when a GNOME &gnomever; component is not up-to-date,
	      you will see an error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
checking for libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0 libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1
gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2 libglade-2.0...
configure: error: Library requirements (libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0
libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1 gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2
libglade-2.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
	      </pre>

	    <p>Simply keeping your ports tree <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a> will
	      prevent these errors.</p>

	    <p>If the <tt>pkg-config</tt> program is out-of-date, you may see
	      a configure error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
configure: error: *** pkg-config too old; version 0.14 or better required.
	      </pre>

	      <p>While this may be buried in some other text, the error is
	        very straight-forward: you need to upgrade pkg-config.
		The pkg-config application is found in the
		<tt>devel/pkg-config</tt> port.  By updating this port to
		the latest version, this error will go away.</p>

	      <p>You may see compiler errors relating to pthreads
	      (&posix; threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>If you are tracking -STABLE or -CURRENT, make sure that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NO_LIBPTHREAD</tt> set in
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.
	      If you still have trouble, please send email to
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.org</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	      It is also helpful to include the config.log from the port's
	      work directory.</p>


		<p><u>Prevent two versions of the same library.</u></p>

		<p>A common source of build failures is the existence of
		  multiple versions of the same library.  This can happen if
		  you have two different versions of a port installed, or
		  can even happen through normal <tt>portupgrade</tt> use.
		  You can back up the libraries in
		  <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt> and remove them, and
		  then run <tt>portupgrade -u -rf pkg-config</tt>.  This
		  will force a rebuild of all GNOME-related apps (and a
		  fair number of other apps) without retaining old versions
		  of libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt>.
		</p>

		<p><u>Fix PREFIX move-related errors.</u></p>

		<p>Starting with 2.16, GNOME now lives in
		  <tt>LOCALBASE</tt> instead of <tt>X11BASE</tt>.
		  This move can cause strange build problems if <a
		  href="&base;/gnome/docs/faq226.html">the proper
		  upgrade steps</a> are not followed.  However, if
		  after following all the steps, you may still see
		  errors like the following:</p>

		<pre>
grep: /usr/X11R6/lib/libglade-2.0.la: No such file or directory
sed: /usr/X11R6/lib/libglade-2.0.la: No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/X11R6/lib/libglade-2.0.la' is not a valid libtool archive
		</pre>

		<p>This error indicates that an old libtool archive (a
		  file that ends with <tt>.la</tt>) is still lingering
		  about on your system.  To find such files, search
		  through the system for libtool archive files that
		  contain the bad string
		  (<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/libglade-2.0.la</tt> in the
		  example above).  To do that, use the following
		  command:</p>

		<pre>
# find / -type f -name "*.la" | xargs grep -l /usr/X11R6/lib/libglade-2.0.la
		</pre>

		<p>For each file that is found, use <tt>pkg_info</tt>
		  to determine which port or package installed it.
		  For example, if you find that
		  <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/libgnomeui-2.0.la</tt> contains
		  the problem libtool reference, do the following:</p>

	        <pre>
# pkg_info -W /usr/X11R6/lib/libgnomeui-2.0.la
		</pre>

		<p>If you get back a package name, then force an
		  upgrade of that package using <tt>portupgrade</tt>.
		  If you do not get back anything, then you can safely
		  delete the libtool archive file.  Once the file is
		  gone, check the directory from which you deleted it
		  for other files with similar names.  In the example
		  above, check for
		  <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/libgnomeui-2.0.*</tt>.  If you
		  find any matching files, delete those, too.  Once
		  all of the files are gone, you can resume building
		  your original port.  Repeat these steps if you
		  encounter further such problems.</p>

	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q3"></a>
	    <p><b>I installed GNOME &gnomever;, but I am missing application
	      foo. What gives?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
	    <p>Only the core Desktop is included in the
	      <tt>gnome2</tt> package.  Here are some other GNOME
	      meta-ports that offer convenient groupings of popular GNOME
	      software.</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>The <b>GNOME Fifth Toe</b> (<tt>x11/gnome2-fifth-toe</tt>)
	        consists of stable GNOME applications that many users
		expect to find in a functional desktop environment.  This
		includes image manipulation applications, chat and instant
		messenger applications, and music and multimedia players</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME Hacker Tools</b>
	        (<tt>devel/gnome2-hacker-tools</tt>) consists of applications
		developers would need to create and maintain GNOME software
		projects.  This includes IDEs, interface builders, "hacker"
		editors, and code generation tools.</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME Office</b> (<tt>editors/gnome2-office</tt>)
	        consists of applications that are commonly found in office or
		productivity suites.  This includes a spreadsheet application,
		word processor, project management application, database
		access application, groupware suite, and diagramming
		application.</li>

	      <li>The <b>GNOME Power Tools</b>
	        (<tt>x11/gnome2-power-tools</tt>) consists of utilities
	        and applets for the technically-minded GNOME user.  It
	        also contains many useful add-on utilities for some of
	        the applications found in the Desktop and Fifth
	        Toe.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>To install any of these from packages:</p>

            <pre>
# pkg_add -r <em>meta-port</em>
            </pre>

	    <p>For example, to install the GNOME Fifth Toe from packages:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_add -r gnome2-fifth-toe
	    </pre>

	    <p>To install any of these from ports:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/<em>category</em>/<em>meta-port</em>
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>For example, to install the GNOME Fifth Toe from ports:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2-fifth-toe
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	  </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME &gnomeoldver; to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
	    <p>The &gnomeoldver; to &gnomever; may have a few
	      caveats.  You are strongly advised to read the
	      <a href="faq226.html">upgrade FAQ</a> for detailed
	      instructions.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q6 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q6"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I keep my GNOME &gnomever; components and applications
	      up-to-date?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
		<p>You are emphatically encouraged to use <tt>portupgrade</tt>
		  or <tt>portmaster</tt> to keep your GNOME
		  &gnomever; components and applications up-to-date.</p>

		<p><u>Update your ports with <tt>portupgrade</tt> or
		  <tt>portmaster</tt>.</u></p>

		<p>Once you have updated your ports tree (presumably with
		  <tt>portsnap</tt>), the following two simple commands will update
		  what needs to be updated, and will prevent inconsistencies:</p>

		<pre>
# pkgdb -F
# portupgrade -a
		</pre>

		<p>OR</p>

		<pre>
# portmaster -a
		</pre>

		<p><u>Start from scratch.</u></p>

	    <p>Despite consistent utilization of <tt>portupgrade</tt>
	      or <tt>portmaster</tt>, if
		  it seems like everything is refusing to build with everything
		  else, you might save yourself a headache or three by removing
		  all your GNOME apps and reinstalling them (your data files will
		  remain untouched).  To do this, follow these commands:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_delete -rf pkg-config\*
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>After running the above commands, you will have to reinstall all
		  the GNOME applications you desire.  This process sounds painful,
		  but it is actually a great way to clear cruft off of your system.
		  Just install applications as you need them, and you will be surprised
		  how much disk space you have reclaimed.  A full rebuild does take
		  a significant amount of time; fortunately, this measure is only
		  rarely needed.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q Uninstall -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="uninstall"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I uninstall GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A Uninstall -->
	    <p>We would prefer that you did not uninstall GNOME ;-),
	      but if you must, you have to decide how much you want to
	      uninstall.  If you have installed <tt>x11/gnome2</tt>
	      and you want to remove all Desktop components that do
	      not have other dependent packages, do the following:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_deinstall -R x11/gnome2
	    </pre>

	    <p><b>Note:</b> the <tt>pkg_deinstall</tt> command requires
	      you have <tt>ports-mgmt/portupgrade</tt> installed.</p>

	    <p>If you want to force a removal of all Desktop
	      components (this is generally not recommended), do the
	      following:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_deinstall -Rf x11/gnome2
	    </pre>
	  </li>

<!-- Q8 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q8"></a>
	    <p><b>Where can I get more themes for GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A8 -->
		<p>On the following websites, you can find themes for GTK+,
		  metacity, nautilus, GDM, icons, backgrounds, and more:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://art.gnome.org">art.gnome.org</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">GNOME-look.org</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.themedepot.org">The Theme Depot</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net">themes.freshmeat.net</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/icons.php">Jimmac's Icons site</a></li>
		</ul>

	    <p>Some of these themes have already been ported to
	      FreeBSD.  Check out the <tt>x11-themes/gnome-icons</tt> and
	      <tt>x11-themes/metacity-themes</tt> meta-ports for a nice
	      sample.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q9 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q9"></a>
	    <p><b>What window managers work well with GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A9 -->
	    <p>The <tt>gnome2</tt> meta-port installs the
	      Metacity window manager by default.  Another popular window
	      manager that works well with GNOME &gnomever; is
	      <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">Sawfish</a>.  Sawfish
	      can be found in <tt>x11-wm/sawfish</tt>.</p>

	    <p>To switch between Metacity and Sawfish in GNOME, you will need
	      to do the following:</p>

<pre>
# killall metacity; sawfish &amp;
# gnome-session-save --gui
</pre>
	    <p>The <tt>gnome-session-save</tt> is important.  Without it, the
	      window manager will revert back to the one previously configured
	      upon next login.  To switch back, simply reverse <tt>sawfish</tt>
	      and <tt>metacity</tt>.</p>

		<p>If you have gotten the GNOME &gnomever; desktop working under an
		  alternative window manager, please take a screenshot and
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">send it to us</a>!
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q10 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q10"></a>
	    <p><b>Does GNOME &gnomever; support anti-aliased fonts?</b></p>
<!-- A10 -->
		<p>Yes!  Anti-aliasing requires X.Org with
		  freetype2 support.  To add freetype2 support to X, make
		  sure you have the following modules loaded in your
		  xorg.conf file under the Modules section:</p>

		<pre>
Load	"freetype"
Load	"type1"
		</pre>

		<p>Then, simply check out the Fonts capplet under
		  Applications->Desktop Preferences.  If you want a good set
		  of TrueType starter fonts, install the
		  <tt>x11-fonts/webfonts</tt> port.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, after adding new fonts to the system, it is
		  necessary to teach fontconfig about them.  If you find that

	    <p><b>How can I control what fonts are anti-aliased?</b></p>
<!-- A11 -->
		<p>GNOME &gnomever; makes use of libXft and fontconfig to
		  handle anti-aliasing.  Fontconfig is a very powerful
		  XML-based font configuration package.  You can create a
		  <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file that controls virtually
		  every aspect of fontconfig.  For example, if you do not
		  want to anti-alias fonts smaller than 16 point, create
		  a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> with the following contents:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="size" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="pixelsize" compare="less_eq"&gt;

        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;

	    <p><b>How do I use GTK+ resource settings for GTK+ applications
	      when not in a GNOME environment?</b></p>
<!-- A13 -->
	    <p>GNOME applications get their GTK+ resources from themes and
	      the corresponding theme engine.  If you would rather run your
	      GTK+ applications in a non-GNOME environment then you will
	      need to create a file named <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>.</p>
	    <p> To use the widgets from a GTK+ theme when in a non-GNOME
	      environment, simply <tt>include</tt> the theme's
	      <tt>gtk-2.0/gtkrc</tt> in your <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>. For example:</p>

		  <pre>include "/usr/local/share/themes/Crux/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"</pre>
		<p> If you prefer, you can use the same GTK+ 1.2 theme for both
		  GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2 applications, which will give your GTK+
		  programs a consistent look. For the most part, you can transfer
		  your settings from your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> file (used for
		  GTK+ 1.2) with a couple of caveats.</p>

	      <ol>
	        <li> If you have any theme engine references, you will have
		  to make sure there is a corresponding GTK+ theme engine.
		  Otherwise, remove the engine entries.</li>
		<li> The default font specification should be outside of
		  any <tt>style</tt> blocks and should be specified with
		  the <tt>gtk-font-name</tt> keyword.  For example:

		  <pre>gtk-font-name = "Verdana 11"</pre>
		</li>
              </ol>

	        <p> Note that while a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file will work
		  in a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file, the opposite is <i>not</i>
		  true: the contents of a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file will
		  <i>not</i> work inside a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file.</p>

		<p>For simply switching GTK+ themes without needing to
		  edit your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> files, you can use the
		  <tt>x11/gtk-theme-switch</tt> and
		  <tt>x11/gtk2-theme-switch</tt> ports.</p>

device          scbus
device          cd

	    <p><b>Why is GNOME so slow to start up?</b></p>
<!-- A20 -->
	    <p>Under normal circumstances, GNOME should only take a
	      few seconds to start up (fifteen at most).  However,
	      certain configurations may cause it to hang for up to an
	      hour at login time.</p>

	    <p>First, make sure your machine's hostname properly
	      resolves.  To test this, run the following command:</p>

	    <pre>
ping `hostname`
	    </pre>

	    <p>If the command fails, you will either have to add your
	      fully-qualified hostname to DNS or to <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>.
	      If you do not have a static IP address, you can append
	      your hostname to the <tt>localhost</tt> line in
	      <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>.  For example, if your machine's
	      hostname is <tt>gnome-rocks.mydomain.com</tt>, edit
	      <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>, and change the line:</p>

	    <pre>
127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.my.domain
	    </pre>

	    <p>To:</p>

	    <pre>
127.0.0.1              localhost localhost.my.domain gnome-rocks gnome-rocks.mydomain.com
	    </pre>

	    <p>Finally, if you have either the TCP or UDP blackhole
	      sysctl enabled, this may cause GNOME to stall on login.
	      If, after fixing hostname resolution,
	      GNOME still takes a long time to startup, verify the following
	      sysctls are set to 0:</p>

	    <pre>
net.inet.tcp.blackhole

	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q22"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I add new MIME types to GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A22 -->
	    <p>Since GNOME 2.8, MIME types are stored in the new
	      FreeDesktop shared-mime-info database.  However,
	      gnome-control-center has not been updated to allow
	      one to easily add MIME types to this database.
	      Therefore, if applications such as Nautilus complain
	      that there is no MIME type associated with a particular
	      file, using the <em>Open With</em> tab under Properties
	      not work.</p>

	    <p>New MIME types can be added in one of two places.  They
	      can either be added system-wide for all users, or added
	      locally on a per-user basis.  System-wide MIME types
	      must be added to
	      <tt>LOCALBASE/share/mime</tt> , where as local MIME types
	      must be added to <tt>~/.local/share/mime</tt>.  In
	      both cases, the procedure is the same.</p>

	    <p>To define a new MIME type, you must create an
	      <em>application</em> and a <em>packages</em> file to
	      describe it.  The application file will be named for
	      the MIME type, and contain its name and a brief
	      comment describing it.  The packages file will list
	      all the extensions associated with this MIME type
	      as well as any special file magic that can be used
	      to identify files without an extension.</p>

	    <p>For example, if we wanted to add a new local MIME type for
	      Windows HTML Help files (i.e. .chm files) called
	      <b>application/x-chm</b>, we would do the
	      following.  First, we would create the directories
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/application</tt> and
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/packages</tt> if they did not
	      already exist.  Then, we create an application file
	      called <tt>x-chm.xml</tt> that we will place in
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/application</tt>.  The file
	      looks like:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mime-type
xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info"
type="application/x-chm"&gt;
  &lt;comment&gt;Windows HTML Help file&lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;/mime-type&gt;
	    </pre>

	    <p>Next, we create a packages file called <tt>chm.xml</tt>
	      that we will place in
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/packages</tt>.  The file looks
	      like:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mime-info
xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info"&gt;
  &lt;mime-type type="application/x-chm"&gt;
    &lt;comment&gt;Windows HTML Help file&lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;glob pattern="*.chm" /&gt;
  &lt;/mime-type&gt;
&lt;/mime-info&gt;
	    </pre>

	    <p>Once the files have been created, the MIME database
	      must be updated.  To do that, run the command:</p>

	    <pre>
% update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
	    </pre>

	    <p>Finally (and unfortunately), you must logout and log
	      back in to GNOME for the changes to fully take effect.
	      Nautilus' <em>Properties-&gt;Open With</em> interface can now
	      be used to associate an application to this MIME type.
	      Hopefully all of this will be made much easier in a future
	      GNOME release.</p>

	    <p><b>How do I enable window compositing in GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A28 -->
	    <p>Starting with GNOME 2.22, the Metacity window manager includes
	      a compositing manager.  When compositing is enabled,
	      widgets will get a drop shadow, and the Alt+Tab
	      application switcher will show previews of the
	      application windows.</p>

	    <p>Compositing is not enabled by default as not all
	      graphics cards and drivers will do well with it.
	      If your graphics card and driver support accelerated 3D
	      rendering and you want to use compositing you can enable
	      it using the following command:</p>

	    <pre>
% gconftool-2 -s --type bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager true
	    </pre>

	    <p>If you want to disable it again, change "true" to
	      "false", and re-run the command.
	      You can also use <tt>gconf-editor</tt> to edit it.</p>

	    <p>If your card is supported by the "nvidia," "intel",
	      "openchrome", or "radeon" (see the radeon(4) man page to make
	      sure your card is supported for 3D acceleration) drivers,
	      then compositing should work for you.</p>

	    <p><b>How do I get GDM to respect my locale settings?</b></p>
<!-- A29 -->
	    <p>Up until GNOME 2.20, GDM would read the locale settings
	      from <tt>/etc/login.conf</tt> or <tt>~/.login.conf</tt>.
	      This was broken in 2.20, and finally restored in GDM
	      2.26.1_3.</p>

	      <p>However, GDM also offers a pull-down Language menu from which
	      you can choose your current locale.  If you would rather not
	      use this menu or <tt>/etc/login.conf</tt>, you can set the
	      locale by adding the following to <tt>~/.profile</tt>:</p>

	    <pre>
export LANG=&lt;locale&gt;
export LC_ALL=&lt;locale&gt;
	    </pre>

	    <p>Here, <tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> is the desired locale
	      (e.g. en_US.UTF-8, es_ES.ISO8859-15, fr_FR.ISO8859-1, etc.).</p>

	    <p>To set the default locale for the GDM greeter, add the
	      same environment variables to <tt>/etc/profile</tt> or
	      define <tt>gdm_lang</tt> to the desired locale
	      in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>.</p>

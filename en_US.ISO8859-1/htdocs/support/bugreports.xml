	    <p>A problem report, or <em>PR</em>, can be about any component
	      of FreeBSD, including problems with the operating system programs, a mistake in the
	      documentation, or a
	      new feature that the submitter wishes to see incorporated.</p>

	    <p>Problem reports begin in the <em>open</em> state, and are closed when the issue
	      is resolved.  A numeric ID is assigned to each PR for tracking.
	      Many FreeBSD changes refer to the
	      PR number that prompted the change.</p>

	<h2>How to Submit a Problem Report</h2>

	    <p>Problem reports are submitted to the development team with
	      the
	      <a href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/submit/">web form</a>.
	      An account will need to be created before a bug can be
	      submitted.
	      Please note that
	      messages sent to a mailing list are <em>not</em> tracked as
	      official problem reports, and may get lost in the noise!</p>

	    <p>Before submitting a problem report, please
	      read the <a
	      href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/problem-reports/">Writing
	      FreeBSD Problem Reports</a> article.  This article describes
	      when to submit a problem report and what
	      to include.
	      Some useful background information is also contained
	      in the <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/pr-guidelines/">Problem
      Report Handling Guidelines</a> article.</p>

	    <p>FreeBSD problem reports are tracked using <a
	      href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>.</p>

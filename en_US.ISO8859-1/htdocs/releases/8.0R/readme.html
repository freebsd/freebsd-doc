<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="INTRO" name="INTRO">1 Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This distribution is a release of FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE, the latest point along the
8.0-STABLE branch.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN30" name="AEN30">1.1 About FreeBSD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for AMD64 and Intel EM64T based
PC hardware (amd64), Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen &#8220;x86&#8221; based PC hardware
(i386), Intel Itanium Processor based computers (ia64), NEC PC-9801/9821 series PCs and
compatibles (pc98), and <span class="TRADEMARK">UltraSPARC</span>&reg; machines
(sparc64). Versions for the <span class="TRADEMARK">ARM</span>&reg; (arm), <span
class="TRADEMARK">MIPS</span>&reg; (mips), and <span
class="TRADEMARK">PowerPC</span>&reg; (powerpc) architectures are currently under
development as well. FreeBSD works with a wide variety of peripherals and configurations
and can be used for everything from software development to games to Internet Service
Provision.</p>

<p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such a system, including
full source code for the kernel and all utilities in the base distribution. With the
source distribution installed, you can literally recompile the entire system from scratch
with one command, making it ideal for students, researchers, or users who simply want to
see how it all works.</p>

<p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the &#8220;Ports Collection&#8221;)
is also provided to make it easy to obtain and install all your favorite traditional
<span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg; utilities for FreeBSD. Each &#8220;port&#8221;
consists of a set of scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a piece of
software, with a single command. Over 20,000 ports, from editors to programming languages
to graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive operating
environment that extends far beyond what's provided by many commercial versions of <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>. Most ports are also available as pre-compiled
&#8220;packages&#8221;, which can be quickly installed from the installation program.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN45" name="AEN45">1.2 Target Audience</a></h3>

<p>This release of FreeBSD is suitable for all users. It has undergone a period of
testing and quality assurance checking to ensure the highest reliability and
dependability.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT1">
<hr />
<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="OBTAIN" name="OBTAIN">2 Obtaining FreeBSD</a></h2>

<p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This section focuses on those ways that
are primarily useful for obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating
an existing installation.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN51" name="AEN51">2.1 CDROM and DVD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM or DVD from several publishers.
This is frequently the most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new installations, as it
provides a convenient way to quickly reinstall the system if necessary. Some
distributions include some of the optional, precompiled &#8220;packages&#8221; from the
FreeBSD Ports Collection, or other extra material.</p>

<p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the project are listed in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"
target="_top">&#8220;Obtaining FreeBSD&#8221;</a> appendix to the Handbook.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN58" name="AEN58">2.2 FTP</a></h3>

<p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the
official FreeBSD release site, or any of its &#8220;mirrors&#8221;.</p>

<p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or on the <a
href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a>
Web pages. Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which to download the
distribution is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact <code class="EMAIL">&#60;<a
href="mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</code> for
more details on becoming an official mirror site. You can also find useful information
for mirror sites at the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/hubs/" target="_top">Mirroring
FreeBSD</a> article.</p>

<p>Mirrors generally contain the ISO images generally used to create a CDROM of a FreeBSD
release. They usually also contain floppy disk images (for applicable platforms), as well
as the files necessary to do an installation over the network. Finally mirrors sites
usually contain a set of packages for the most current release.</p>

Project</a></h2>

<div class="SECT2">
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN72" name="AEN72">3.1 Email and Mailing Lists</a></h3>

<p>For any questions or general technical support issues, please send mail to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD
general questions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>If you're tracking the 8.0-STABLE development efforts, you <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> join the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a>, in order to keep abreast of recent
developments and changes that may affect the way you use and maintain the system.</p>

<p>Being a largely-volunteer effort, the FreeBSD Project is always happy to have extra
hands willing to help--there are already far more desired enhancements than there is time
to implement them. To contact the developers on technical matters, or with offers of
help, please send mail to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers" target="_top">FreeBSD
technical discussions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that these mailing lists can experience <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">significant</i></span> amounts of traffic. If you have slow or expensive
mail access, or are only interested in keeping up with major FreeBSD events, you may find
it preferable to subscribe instead to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce" target="_top">FreeBSD
announcements mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing to do so. Visit the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo" target="_top">FreeBSD Mailman Info
Page</a>. This will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc. There are a number of mailing lists targeted at special interest groups
not mentioned here; more information can be obtained either from the Mailman pages or the
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#mailing-list" target="_top">mailing lists
section</a> of the FreeBSD Web site.</p>

<div class="IMPORTANT">
<blockquote class="IMPORTANT">
<p><b>Important:</b> Do <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> send
email to the lists asking to be subscribed. Use the Mailman interface instead.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN90" name="AEN90">3.2 Submitting Problem Reports</a></h3>

<p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always valued--please do not
hesitate to report any problems you may find. Bug reports with attached fixes are of
course even more welcome.</p>

<p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with Internet mail
connectivity is to use the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
command. &#8220;Problem Reports&#8221; (PRs) submitted in this way will be filed and
their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers will do their best to respond to all
reported bugs as soon as possible. <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi" target="_top">A list of all active
PRs</a> is available on the FreeBSD Web site; this list is useful to see what potential
problems other users have encountered.</p>

<p>Note that <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
itself is a shell script that should be easy to move even onto a non-FreeBSD system.
Using this interface is highly preferred. If, for some reason, you are unable to use <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a> to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-bugs" target="_top">FreeBSD
problem reports mailing list</a>.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="RELEASE-DOCS" name="RELEASE-DOCS">4.1 Release
Documentation</a></h3>

<p>A number of other files provide more specific information about this release
distribution. These files are provided in various formats. Most distributions will
include both ASCII text (<tt class="FILENAME">.TXT</tt>) and HTML (<tt
class="FILENAME">.HTM</tt>) renditions. Some distributions may also include other formats
such as Portable Document Format (<tt class="FILENAME">.PDF</tt>).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><tt class="FILENAME">README.TXT</tt>: This file, which gives some general information
about FreeBSD as well as some cursory notes about obtaining a distribution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="FILENAME">RELNOTES.TXT</tt>: The release notes, showing what's new and
different in FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE compared to the previous release (FreeBSD
7.2-RELEASE).</p>

<li>
<p><tt class="FILENAME">ERRATA.TXT</tt>: Release errata. Late-breaking, post-release
information can be found in this file, which is principally applicable to releases (as
opposed to snapshots). It is important to consult this file before installing a release
of FreeBSD, as it contains the latest information on problems which have been found and
fixed since the release was created.</p>

<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">sysinstall</span>(8)</span></a>
(currently amd64, i386, ia64, pc98, and sparc64), these documents are generally available
via the Documentation menu during installation. Once the system is installed, you can
revisit this menu by re-running the <a

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> It is extremely important to read the errata for any given release before
installing it, to learn about any &#8220;late-breaking news&#8221; or post-release
problems. The errata file accompanying each release (most likely right next to this file)
is already out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet
and should be consulted as the &#8220;current errata&#8221; for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN144" name="AEN144">4.2 Manual Pages</a></h3>

<p>As with almost all <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> like operating systems, FreeBSD
comes with a set of on-line manual pages, accessed through the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">man</span>(1)</span></a> command
or through the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi" target="_top">hypertext
manual pages gateway</a> on the FreeBSD Web site. In general, the manual pages provide
information on the different commands and APIs available to the FreeBSD user.</p>

<p>In some cases, manual pages are written to give information on particular topics.
Notable examples of such manual pages are <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tuning</span>(7)</span></a> (a
guide to performance tuning), <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=security&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">security</span>(7)</span></a> (an
introduction to FreeBSD security), and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE">

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN162" name="AEN162">4.3 Books and Articles</a></h3>

<p>Two highly-useful collections of FreeBSD-related information, maintained by the
FreeBSD Project, are the FreeBSD Handbook and FreeBSD FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions
document). On-line versions of the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
target="_top">Handbook</a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/" target="_top">FAQ</a> are
always available from the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/docs.html"
target="_top">FreeBSD Documentation page</a> or its mirrors. If you install the <tt
class="FILENAME">doc</tt> distribution set, you can use a Web browser to read the
Handbook and FAQ locally. In particular, note that the Handbook contains a step-by-step
guide to installing FreeBSD.</p>

<p>A number of on-line books and articles, also maintained by the FreeBSD Project, cover
more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics. This material spans a wide range of topics,
from effective use of the mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other operating
systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like the Handbook and FAQ, these documents are
available from the FreeBSD Documentation Page or in the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
distribution set.</p>

<p>A listing of other books and documents about FreeBSD can be found in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html"
target="_top">bibliography</a> of the FreeBSD Handbook. Because of FreeBSD's strong <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> heritage, many other articles and books written for <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> systems are applicable as well, some of which are also
listed in the bibliography.</p>

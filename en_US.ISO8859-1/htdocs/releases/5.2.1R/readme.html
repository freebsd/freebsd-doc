<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="INTRO" name="INTRO">1 Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This distribution is a release of FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE. This is a ``point release''.
It exists primarily to address some specific issues found (after-the-fact) in the FreeBSD
5.2-RELEASE distribution. Changes made for this point release are described, in the
release notes. Generally speaking, the features of this release are unchanged compared to
FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN26" name="AEN26">1.1 About FreeBSD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen
``x86'' based PC hardware (<span class="TRADEMARK">i386</span>&#8482;), NEC PC-9801/9821
series PCs and compatibles (pc98), DEC/Compaq/HP Alpha computers (alpha), and <span
class="TRADEMARK">UltraSPARC</span>&reg; machines (<span
class="TRADEMARK">Sparc64</span>&reg;). Versions for the IA64 (ia64), <span
class="TRADEMARK">PowerPC</span>&reg; (<span class="TRADEMARK">PowerPC</span>), and AMD
``Hammer'' (amd64) architectures are currently under development as well. FreeBSD works
with a wide variety of peripherals and configurations and can be used for everything from
software development to games to Internet Service Provision.</p>

<p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such a system, including
full source code for the kernel and all utilities in the base distribution. With the
source distribution installed, you can literally recompile the entire system from scratch
with one command, making it ideal for students, researchers, or users who simply want to
see how it all works.</p>

<p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the ``Ports Collection'') is also
provided to make it easy to obtain and install all your favorite traditional <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg; utilities for FreeBSD. Each ``port'' consists of a set
of scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a piece of software, with a single
command. Over 10,000 ports, from editors to programming languages to graphical
applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive operating environment that
extends far beyond what's provided by many commercial versions of <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>. Most ports are also available as pre-compiled
``packages'', which can be quickly installed from the installation program.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN43" name="AEN43">1.2 Target Audience</a></h3>

<p>This release of FreeBSD is suitable for all users. It has undergone a period of
testing and quality assurance checking to ensure the highest reliability and
dependability.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT1">
<hr />
<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="OBTAIN" name="OBTAIN">2 Obtaining FreeBSD</a></h2>

<p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This section focuses on those ways that
are primarily useful for obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating
an existing installation.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN49" name="AEN49">2.1 CDROM and DVD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM or DVD from several publishers.
This is frequently the most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new installations, as it
provides a convenient way to quickly reinstall the system if necessary. Some
distributions include some of the optional, precompiled ``packages'' from the FreeBSD
Ports Collection.</p>

<p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the project are listed in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"
target="_top">``Obtaining FreeBSD''</a> appendix to the Handbook.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN56" name="AEN56">2.2 FTP</a></h3>

<p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the
official FreeBSD release site, or any of its ``mirrors''.</p>

<p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or on the <a
href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a>
Web pages. Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which to download the
distribution is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact <code class="EMAIL">&#60;<a
href="mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</code> for
more details on becoming an official mirror site. You can also find useful information
for mirror sites at the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/hubs/" target="_top">Mirroring
FreeBSD</a> article.</p>

<p>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images necessary to begin an installation,
as well as the distribution files needed for the install process itself. Many mirrors
also contain the ISO images necessary to create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.</p>

Project</a></h2>

<div class="SECT2">
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN70" name="AEN70">3.1 Email and Mailing Lists</a></h3>

<p>For any questions or general technical support issues, please send mail to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD
general questions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>If you're tracking the 5-CURRENT development efforts, you <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> join the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a>, in order to keep abreast of recent
developments and changes that may affect the way you use and maintain the system.</p>

<p>Being a largely-volunteer effort, the FreeBSD Project is always happy to have extra
hands willing to help--there are already far more desired enhancements than there is time
to implement them. To contact the developers on technical matters, or with offers of
help, please send mail to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers" target="_top">FreeBSD
technical discussions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that these mailing lists can experience <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">significant</i></span> amounts of traffic. If you have slow or expensive
mail access, or are only interested in keeping up with major FreeBSD events, you may find
it preferable to subscribe instead to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce" target="_top">FreeBSD
announcements mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing to do so. Visit the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo" target="_top">FreeBSD Mailman Info
Page</a>. This will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc. There are a number of mailing lists targeted at special interest groups
not mentioned here; more information can be obtained either from the Mailman pages or the
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#mailing-list" target="_top">mailing lists
section</a> of the FreeBSD Web site.</p>

<div class="IMPORTANT">
<blockquote class="IMPORTANT">
<p><b>Important:</b> Do <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> send
email to the lists asking to be subscribed. Use the Mailman interface instead.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN88" name="AEN88">3.2 Submitting Problem Reports</a></h3>

<p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always valued--please do not
hesitate to report any problems you may find. Bug reports with attached fixes are of
course even more welcome.</p>

<p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with Internet mail
connectivity is to use the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2.1-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
command. ``Problem Reports'' (PRs) submitted in this way will be filed and their progress
tracked; the FreeBSD developers will do their best to respond to all reported bugs as
soon as possible. <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi"
target="_top">A list of all active PRs</a> is available on the FreeBSD Web site; this
list is useful to see what potential problems other users have encountered.</p>

<p>Note that <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2.1-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
itself is a shell script that should be easy to move even onto a non-FreeBSD system.
Using this interface is highly preferred. If, for some reason, you are unable to use <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2.1-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a> to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-bugs" target="_top">FreeBSD
problem reports mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>For more information, <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/problem-reports/"

errata file accompanying each release (most likely right next to this file) is already
out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the ``current errata'' for this release. These other copies of the errata

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN158" name="AEN158">4.2 Manual Pages</a></h3>

<p>As with almost all <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> like operating systems, FreeBSD
comes with a set of on-line manual pages, accessed through the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2.1-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">man</span>(1)</span></a> command
or through the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi" target="_top">hypertext
manual pages gateway</a> on the FreeBSD Web site. In general, the manual pages provide
information on the different commands and APIs available to the FreeBSD user.</p>

<p>In some cases, manual pages are written to give information on particular topics.
Notable examples of such manual pages are <a

Handbook and FAQ locally.</p>

<p>A number of on-line books and articles, also maintained by the FreeBSD Project, cover
more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics. This material spans a wide range of topics,
from effective use of the mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other operating
systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like the Handbook and FAQ, these documents are
available from the FreeBSD Documentation Page or in the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>

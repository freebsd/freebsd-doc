<p>Please read an <A HREF="security.html">important security 
announcement</A> regarding FreeBSD 2.1.6</p>

<p>FreeBSD 2.1.6 is now available in:</p>

<blockquote>

<![ IGNORE [
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.6-RELEASE">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.6-RELEASE</a>
]]>

<a href="security.html">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.6-RELEASE</a>

</blockquote>

<p>And shortly from its various mirror sites, a list of which may be
obtained from:  <a href="&base;/handbook/mirrors.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html</a></p>

<p>This release will also be available on CDROM from <a
href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</a>, hopefully
shipping within the next 4-6 weeks.</p>

<p>Those puzzled by the near-simultaneous release of 2.1.6 and 2.2 need
also look no further than http://www.FreeBSD.org/branch.html for the
reasons behind this release schedule.  CDROM subscription customers
should also see this page for information on Walnut Creek CDROM's
plans for these releases.</p>

<p>If you are a commercial user of FreeBSD who would like to take
advantage of recent bug fixes without making the jump to our more
ambitious 2.2 release (or delay that jump until 2.2 has had more time
to mature), or if you're simply looking for the lowest-impact upgrade
from 2.1.5, then 2.1.6-RELEASE is for you.</p>

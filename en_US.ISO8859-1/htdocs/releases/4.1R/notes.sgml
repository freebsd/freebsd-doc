1. What's new since 4.0-RELEASE
--------------------------------------

1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

FreeBSD 4.1-RELEASE contains updated code from the KAME project
(http://www.kame.net) including the following features:

* Significantly improved IPSEC functionality.  In particular, IPSEC
  security associations must no longer be manually keyed: the new code
  supports racoon, the KAME IKE daemon, which is located in
  /usr/ports/security/racoon.  Racoon has been shown to interoperate
  well with other vendor IKE systems, meaning that FreeBSD 4.1 can be
  used in a heterogeneous IPSEC environment.  However, racoon *is*
  still a work in progress, meaning that there may still be bugs,
  configuration syntax changes, etc.

* About 9 months of fixes and improvements to the IPv6 code relative to
  what was in 4.0-RELEASE.

* FreeBSD 4.1 can now be installed on an IPv6-only network - this will be
  the first release of FreeBSD that never needs to operate using IPv4 at
  all! ftp7.jp.FreeBSD.org (Listed as Japan #7 in sysinstall) is an
  IPv6-reachable mirror site for installation and package-fetching.

* The ALTQ traffic-shaping system has not yet been merged - it will
  hopefully be added before the release of 4.2.  The more experimental
  KAME code has also not been merged.  If you need those features,
  consider using the 4.1-RELEASE+KAME snapshots from
  ftp://ftp.kame.net which will become available after 4.1-RELEASE.

* KNOWN ISSUES: NFS mounts over IPSEC do not seem to work reliably in
  all cases - mount hangs and possible data corruption have been
  observed.

A new event notification facility called kqueue was added to the
FreeBSD kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to replace
poll/select, offering improved performance, as well as the ability
to report many different types of events.  Support for monitoring
changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files are present, as well as
for signals and processes.

Support for Intel's Wired for Management 2.0 (PXE) was added to
the FreeBSD boot loader.  Due to API differences, the older PXE
versions are not supported.  This allow network booting using DHCP.

For the alpha release of FreeBSD, the following specifics also
apply:

   FreeBSD/alpha now posseses a loader with FICL (Forth support) builtin. 

   Parallel ports are now supported.

   Support for multiple new Alpha system types has been added. Please
   check HARDWARE.TXT for details.

   AlphaServer 4100 (Rawhide) does not want to allow installation using
   floppies or cdrom. Workaround is to install using another Alpha machine and 
   move the disk to the AS4100. Once installed FreeBSD runs fine.

   AlphaServer 2100A (Lynx) is not supported in this release. Note that
   AlphaServer 2100 (Sable) works fine.

   Machines that have onboard IDE interfaces that their SRM can boot from 
   are now supported with the IDE disk being the root/boot device. See
   HARDWARE.TXT for machine specifics like speed, use of DMA etc.

   Note that TGA consoles (either builtin or on TGA expansion cards) will
   not work. You will need to use a serial console or install a VGA card.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

The kernel and userland have been audited for bugs and security
vulnerabilities resulting from the incorrect use of format strings in
vfprintf()-like functions.  No vulnerabilities were discovered.

For additional security fixes, see the list of released Security
Advisories located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/

1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

Support for the KAME IKE daemon, racoon, as noted in section 1.1 above.

Several additional system utilities (whois, fetch, and possibly
others) have gained the ability to operate over IPv6.

cdcontrol(1) now supports a "cdid" command, which calculates and
displays the CD serial number, using the same algorithm used by the CDDB
database.

mtree(8) now includes support for a file listing pathnames to be excluded
when creating and verifying prototypes.  This makes it easier to use
mtree as a part of an intrusion-detection system.

The OPIE one-time-password suite has been updated to 2.32.

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.1.0, which provides support for the
SSH2 protocol, including DSA keys.  Therefore, OpenSSH users in the US
no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed RSAREF toolkit
which is required to handle RSA keys.  OpenSSH 2.1 interoperates well
with other SSH2 clients and servers, including the ssh2 port.  See
http://www.openssh.com for more details.

OpenSSH can now authenticate using OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.
Support is not yet available in SSH2 mode.

camcontrol(8) now includes a built in 'format' function to low-level
format SCSI disks.

Support for USB devices was added to the GENERIC kernel and to the
installation programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that
an AT keyboard must still be used during the initial install, but it
should work fine afterwards.

The entire i386 bootstrap was revamped to support automatic detection and
use of the Enhanced Disk Drive BIOS extensions to support booting beyond
the 1023rd cylinder.  As part of this change, the FreeBSD boot manager
(boot0) was increased from 1 sector in size (512 bytes), to 2 sectors in
length (1024 bytes).  As a result, several userland changes were made to
cope with MBR boot loaders of varying sizes.

libfetch has been greatly improved.  fetch(1) and the pkg tools now use
libfetch instead of libftpio, which means that the pkg tools have gained
HTTP support, and both have gained IPv6 support.

The csh(1) shell has been replaced by tcsh(1), although it can still
be run as csh(1).

The more(1) command has been replaced by less(1), although it can still
be run as more(1).

ls(1) can produce colorized listings with the -G flag (and appropriate
terminal support).

2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------
FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA, MCA and PCI
bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium class machines (though the
386sx is not recommended).  Support for generic IDE or ESDI drive
configurations, various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is
also provided.

What follows is a list of all peripherals currently known to work with

4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -stable development efforts, you should
definitely join the -stable mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!

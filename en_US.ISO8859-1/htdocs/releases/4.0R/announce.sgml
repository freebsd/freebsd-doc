  <b>From:</b> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@zippy.cdrom.com&gt;<br>
  <b>To:</b> announce@FreeBSD.org<br>
  <b>Subject:</b> 4.0-RELEASE is now available</p>

<p>Well, it's a bit late and hopefully all the better for it, but here
  it is.  It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD
  4.0-RELEASE.  This is our first release along the 4.x-stable (RELENG_4)
  branch and contains a number of significant advancements over FreeBSD
  3.4.  Please see the release notes for further information as the list
  of new features is too long to list here.</p>

<p>FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE is available from ftp.FreeBSD.org and various FTP
  mirror sites throughout the world.  It can also be ordered on CD from
  <a href="http://www.freebsdmall.com/">The FreeBSD Mall</a>, from where
  it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set.  There will also be two such
  sets available for 4.0, one containing installation bits for the x86
  architecture (as well a lot of other material of general interest to
  programmers and end-users alike) and another for DEC Alpha architecture
  machines.</p>

<p>As usual, disc #1 from Walnut Creek CDROM's official distribution (for
  both architectures) will also be available via anonymous FTP as soon
  as it's been compiled in its final form.  Please monitor the master FTP
  site for details.  We also can't promise that all the mirror sites will
  carry this rather large (660MB) installation image, but it will at least
  be available (once ready) from:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso</a><br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.0-install.iso</a></p>

<p>These files allow one to install the base system and all of its most
  important add-ons from a single bootable image, one which can be written
  as a raw ISO 9660 image by most CD creator software.</p>

<p>Even though we make our installation CDs freely available, we also
  hope that you'll continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing
  one of its official CD releases from the FreeBSD mall.  A portion of
  each sale goes to support FreeBSD's development and general infrastructure
  and is thus highly appreciated.</p>

<p>The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD</a></p>

1. What's new since the 3.1/4.0 branch
--------------------------------------
All changes described here are unique to the 4.0 branch unless
specifically marked as [MERGED] features.


1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

NFS has been immensely improved with bug fixes and performance tuning.

Support for more than 32 signals has been added. 

POSIX 1003.1 conformant SA_SIGINFO signal handlers are now supported.
SIGFPE signal handlers (both SA_SIGINFO and traditional BSD handlers)
now get meaningful error codes describing the kind of error. See
sigaction(2).

IA32 hardware debug registers are now supported.  See ptrace(2) and
procfs(5).

Jail(8) aware sysctl(8) variables have been added for Linux mode.

A large number of bug fixes and performance improvements have been
made to the VM system, including and most especially to mmap() and
related functions.  The MAP_NOSYNC option has been added to better support 
the use of shared files as an IPC mechanism.  The VM system's swapper has
been completely rewritten and performance has been greatly enhanced,
especially when swapping over NFS.

An emulator for SVR4 binaries has been added.

Support has been added for direct access to NTFS filesystems.

Support for the NWFS filesystem and NetWare client connections has
been added.  A variety of NetWare related tools, such as ipxping
and ncprint, have been added in ports/net/ncplib.

A new ATA/ATAPI driver has been implemented. The aim of this new
subsystem is to maximise performance on modern ATA/ATAPI based
systems. The "ata" driver supports all major chipsets including
those used on PCI card based controllers like the Promise and the
Abit/SIIG. There is support for busmaster DMA transfers upto and 
including the new ATA/66 mode. The 'ata' driver automatically
setup the hardware for the maximum possible transfer mode to
maximise system throughput. Supported devices are all ATA compliant
disks and ATAPI CDROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, LS120, ZIP 
and tape drives. The ata driver also support PCCARD ATA devices. 
The 'ata' driver also sports error handling and timeout code, to 
avoid the problems of "hung" ATA/ATAPI devices.

A new utility 'burncd' has been written to facilitate easy control
of ATAPI CD-R and CD-RW drives, and allows burning of CD-R/RW
media in a wide selction of formats, including multisession mode.

Driver support has been added for PCI gigabit ethernet adapters
based on the Alteon Networks Tigon 1 and Tigon 2 chipsets, including
the Alteon AceNIC, 3Com 3c985 and Netgear GA620. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for IEEE 802.11 PCMCIA wireless network
adapters based on the Lucent Hermes chipset, including the Lucent
WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11, the Cabletron RoamAbout and Melco Aireconnect.  
Both 2Mbps and 6Mbps Turbo adapters are supported. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for PCI fast ethernet cards based
on the ADMtek Inc. AL981 Comet chipset. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for PCI fast ethernet cards based
on the ADMtek Inc. AL985 Centaur chipset. [MERGED]

Support has been added for the Rise mP6 processor. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for SysKonnect SK-984x PCI gigabit
ethernet adapters. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for Adaptec Duralink PCI ethernet adapters
based on the Adaptec AIC-6915 fast ethernet controller. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for PCI fast ethernet adapters based on
the Sundance Technologies ST201 controller, including the D-Link DFE-550TX.
[MERGED]

Driver support has been added for the 3Com 3c905C-TX. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for SMC SMC9xxx-based Ethernet adapters.

Several IPFW improvements including stateful inspection, user- and
group-based firewalling, dynamic logging with arbitrary logging
limits, probabilistic rule match. [MERGED]

IPv6 IPFW has been imported from the KAME project.

The "dummynet" traffic shaper now handles efficiently thousands
of independent queues. [MERGED]

Several fixes to bridging, which now supports clusters of interfaces
with bridging being done independently within each cluster. [MERGED]

The top-level syslog(3) category "security" has been added, and IPFW now
uses syslog(3) to log all messages to /var/log/security.

Driver support has been added for PCI fast ethernet adapters based on
the Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 and SiS 7016 ethernet controllers.
[MERGED]

Driver support has been added for PCI fast ethernet adapters based on
the Davicom DM9100 and DM9102 ethernet controllers, including the Jaton
Corporation XpressNet.

Support has been added for blocking incoming ICMP redirects, outgoing RST
frames and incoming SYN|FIN frames in order to lessen or nullify the
impact of certain kinds of DoS attacks. [MERGED]

Support has been added for forwarding IP datagrams without inspecting or
decreasing the TTL in order to make gateways and firewalls less visible
and therefore less exposed to attacks. [MERGED]

The old `sd' (SCSI Disk) backwards compatibility support has been removed.
Any usage of "/dev/sd*" in ``/etc/fstab'' must be replaced by "/dev/da*".
In addition, any useage of "/dev/*sd*" in scripts need to be changed.
Even if you have old `sd' device entries in /dev, they will no longer work.

The `al' `ax' `dm' `pn' and `mx' drivers have been removed and replaced
with a single driver (`dc') in order to reduce code duplication. The
new driver handles all chipsets supported by the older drivers, and it
offers improved support for 10/100 cards based on the DEC/Intel 21143.

Driver support has been added for the 3Com 3c450-TX HomeConnect
PCI ethernet NIC. [MERGED]

Driver support has been added for USB ethernet adapters based on
the ADMtek AN986 Pegasus chip, including the LinkSys USB100TX,
the Billionton USB100, the Melco Inc. LU-ATX, the D-Link 650TX
and the SMC-2202USB.

Driver support has been added for USB ethernet adapters based on
the Kawasaki LSI KL5KUSB101B chip, including the LinkSys USB10T,
the Peracom USB Ethernet Adapter, the 3Com 3c19250, the Entrega
NET-USB-E45, the ADS Technologies USB-10BT, the ATen UC10T, the
Netgear EA101, the D-Link DSB-650, and the SMC 2102USB and 2104USB.

IPfilter version 3.3.8 has been integrated.

Driver support has been added for USB ethernet adapters based on
the CATC USB-EL1210A chip, including the CATC Netmate and Netmate II,
and the Belkin F5U111.

Driver support has been added for Aironet 4500/4800 802.11 wireless
adapters. This includes PCMCIA, PCI and ISA models.

IPv6 support has been imported from the KAME project. This includes the
kernel IPv6 protocol stack (sys/netinet6), TCP IPv6 support, configurable
IPv6 and IPv4 tunneling over IPv6 or IPv4, and IPv6 TCP to IPv4 TCP
translation gateway support. Protocol-independent name resolution
functions have been added to libc (getaddrinfo, getnameinfo, etc).

Floating point exceptions for new processes (devide-by-zero,
under/overflow, invalid range etc.) are now disabled by default. Use
fpsetmask(3) to reenable those you need. Note that integer
device-by-zero is not covered by the FPU and will still trap after
this change. Also note that conversion of float/double to integer
where the float variable is too big now doesn't trap as well (it can't
be separated from other operations we want masked).


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

Numerous security enhancements and fixes have been applied during the
course of development of FreeBSD 4.0. Most of these have also been
backported to the 3.X-STABLE series.

A new jail(2) system call and admin command (jail(8)) have been added for
additional flexibility in creating secure process execution environments.

OpenSSL v0.9.4 (a general-purpose cryptography and SSL2/3/TLSv1 toolkit)
has been integrated with the base system. In the future this will be used
to provide strong cryptography for FreeBSD utilities out-of-the-box.

OpenSSH 1.2 has been integrated with the base system. OpenSSH is a free
(BSD-licensed), full-featured implementation of the SSH v1 protocol, which
is completely interoperable with other SSH v1 clients and servers, such as
the /usr/ports/security/ssh port.  OpenSSH provides all of the features of
this port - in fact it is based on an older release before the software
became restrictively licensed.  FreeBSD 4.0 provides SSH client/server
functionality out-of-the-box if you choose to install the 'DES'
cryptography distribution in sysinstall.

Telnet has a new encrypted authentication mechanism called SRA. SRA
uses a Diffie-Hellmen exchange to establish a session key, then uses
that to DES encrypt the username and password. As a side effect the
session key is used to DES encrypt the session. SRA is vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks, the DH parameters are on the small side,
and DES is showing its age, but the benefits are that it requires
absolutely no administrative changes to the machine to work, and is
at the very least a step up from plaintext. To use it, you need to
either use "telnet -ax" or set up a .telnetrc to enable it by default.

IPsec support has been imported from the KAME project. This includes IPsec
tunnel mode to implement a Virtual Private Network via a security gateway,
and IPsec transport mode to achieve secure socket-level communication.
Also, kernel-internal crypto code has been imported to sys/crypto, and
IPsec support has been added to the following userland applications:
sbin/ping, usr.sbin/inetd, usr.sbin/rrenumd, usr.sbin/traceroute6,
usr.sbin/rtadvd, usr.sbin/setkey


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

The base C/C++ compiler has been upgraded from GCC 2.7.2 to GCC 2.95.2.
This gives users full ISO C++ support, and preliminary C9x support.

Various changes has been made to /bin/sh to improve POSIX 1003.2
conformance, especially for scripting.

The f77 emulation via f2c has been replaced by a native F77 compiler.

The timezone database has been updated to catch all of the recent changes
in Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Central and South America.
The timezone data files now contain a magic number allowing for easy
identification.

Groff/troff/eqn has been updated to version 1.15.

Gdb has been updated to version 4.18.

Numerous fixes have been applied to improve the security of FreeBSD code
as part of the FreeBSD Auditing Project.

FreeBSD's threads library, libc_r, has had many features and performance
improvements added, which makes it almost completely POSIX-compliant.  In
addition, Linux's kernel-supported LinuxThreads library is now available as
a port (ports/devel/linuxthreads), which can be used for native FreeBSD
programs.

The following dedicated IPv6 applications have been added:
 sbin/ping6, sbin/rtsol, usr.sbin/gifconfig, usr.sbin/ifmcstat,
 usr.sbin/pim6dd, usr.sbin/pim6sd, usr.sbin/prefix, usr.sbin/rip6query,
 usr.sbin/route6d, usr.sbin/rrenumd, usr.sbin/rtadvd, usr.sbin/rtsold,
 usr.sbin/traceroute6

The following applications have been updated to support IPv6:
 usr.bin/netstat, usr.bin/fstat, usr.bin/sockstat, usr.sbin/tcpdchk,
 usr.sbin/tcpdump, usr.sbin/trpt, libexec/ftpd, libexec/rlogind,
 libexec/rshd, libexec/telnetd

Many ports have been updated to support IPv6. See the 'ipv6' virtual ports
category for a list.

Sysinstall enables PC-card controllers and pccardd(8) for PC-card 
installation media.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE and 3.X-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite F
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and some of the following issues may affect you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!

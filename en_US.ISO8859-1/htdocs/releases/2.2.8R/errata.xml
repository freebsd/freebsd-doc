For the latest information.

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 2.2.8:   None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o /usr/sbin/sysctl is an invalid link and whereis(1) doesn't work.</strong>

Fix: sysctl(8) has actually moved to /sbin/sysctl.  Simply create
     a symbolic link for compatability purposes as follows:

        ln -sf /sbin/sysctl /usr/sbin

     or syncronize your sources with 2.2-stable and rebuild/install
     from /usr/src/usr.bin/whereis/ and just rm /usr/sbin/sysctl

<strong>o    /usr/share/doc/FAQ is in spanish.</strong>

Fix: This was a build failure which affected only the FAQ and has since
     been fixed.  If you are already cvsup/CTM'ing the doc-all tag then
     you can simply remake and install the FAQ from sources, otherwise
     grab ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/FAQ.tar.gz and unpack
     as follows:  tar --unlink -xvzf FAQ.tar.gz -C /usr/share/doc
     to get an english FAQ.

<strong>o    getpwnam(3) semantics are incorrect in some cases.</strong>

Fix: If passed a string longer than the maximum allowed for a user name,
     getpwnam will incorrectly return an entry for a user that matches the
     initial characters in the string up to the maximum length allowed for a
     user name.  To correct this behaviour, libc needs to be patched and
     recompiled.  The appropriate patch can be obtained from:
     http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/lib/libc/gen/getpwent.c.diff?r1="1".35.2.2&amp;r2="1".35.2.3

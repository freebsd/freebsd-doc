</p>

    <p>Could it be?  Could the long-awaited release of FreeBSD
      2.1 truly have arrived?</p>

    <p>It gives me great pleasure to answer those questions with
      a ``yes!''</p>

    <p>FreeBSD 2.1.0-RELEASE is now available on <a
      href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.0-RELEASE/">ftp.freebsd.org</a>
      and various FTP <a
      href="../../handbook/mirrors.html">mirror sites throughout
      the world</a>.  It can also be ordered on CD from <a
      href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek CDROM</a>, from
      where it will be shipping shortly.</p>

    <p>FreeBSD 2.1 represents the culmination of 6 months worth
      of work on the 2.1-STABLE branch of FreeBSD since the
      previous release (FreeBSD 2.0.5).</p>

    <p>The STABLE branch was conceived out of the need to allow
      FreeBSD to grow and support long-term development projects
      like devfs, NFSv3, IPX, PCCARD, etc. while at the same time
      not jeopardizing the stability of its existing user base.
      Experimental or high-impact changes are allowed into <a
      href="../../handbook/current.html">FreeBSD-current</a>,
      which represents a sort of shared group development tree,
      and only well tested or obvious fixes are allowed into
      STABLE.  In a few rare cases, where some bit of
      functionality was entirely missing before, we've supplied
      an ALPHA test quality version in STABLE on the premise that
      some functionality is better than none at all (a good
      example being the IDE CDROM driver).</p>

    <p>For more information on the 2.1 release itself, please
      consult the documentation that accompanies the <a
      href="../../handbook/install.html">installation
      procedure</a>.</p>

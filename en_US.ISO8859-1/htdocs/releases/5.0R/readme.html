        Introduction</a></h1>

        <p>This distribution is a release of FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE,
        the latest point along the 5-CURRENT branch.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN17" name="AEN17">1.1 About
          FreeBSD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite
          for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen ``x86'' based PC
          hardware, Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers, and
          UltraSPARC machines. Versions for the IA64 and PowerPC
          architectures are currently under development as well.
          FreeBSD works with a wide variety of peripherals and
          configurations and can be used for everything from
          software development to games to Internet Service
          Provision.</p>

          <p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need
          to run such a system, including full source code for the
          kernel and all utilities in the base distribution. With
          the source distribution installed, you can literally
          recompile the entire system from scratch with one
          command, making it ideal for students, researchers, or
          users who simply want to see how it all works.</p>

          <p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
          ``Ports Collection'') is also provided to make it easy to
          obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
          utilities for FreeBSD. Each ``port'' consists of a set of
          scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a
          piece of software, with a single command. Over 7,800
          ports, from editors to programming languages to graphical
          applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive
          operating environment that extends far beyond what's
          provided by many commercial versions of UNIX. Most ports
          are also available as pre-compiled ``packages'', which
          can be quickly installed from the installation
          program.</p>

          Audience</a></h2>

          <p>This release of FreeBSD is suitable for all users. It
          has undergone a period of testing and quality assurance
          checking to ensure the highest reliability and
          dependability.</p>

        FreeBSD</a></h1>

        <p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This
        section focuses on those ways that are primarily useful for
        obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than
        updating an existing installation.</p>

        <div class="SECT2">

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN32" name="AEN32">2.1 CDROM
          and DVD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM
          or DVD from several publishers. This is frequently the
          most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new
          installations, as it provides a convenient way to quickly
          reinstall the system if necessary. Some distributions
          include some of the optional, precompiled ``packages''
          from the FreeBSD Ports Collection.</p>

          <p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the
          project are listed in the <a

          FTP</a></h2>

          <p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of
          its optional packages from <a
          href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/"
          target="_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the
          official FreeBSD release site, or any of its
          ``mirrors''.</p>

          <p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in
          the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
           target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or
          on the <a href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/"
          target="_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a> Web
          pages. Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from
          which to download the distribution is highly
          recommended.</p>

          <p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact
          <tt class="EMAIL">&#60;<a
          href="mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</tt>
          for more details on becoming an official mirror site. You
          can also find useful information for mirror sites at the
          <a

           target="_top">Mirroring FreeBSD</a> article.</p>

          <p>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images
          necessary to begin an installation, as well as the
          distribution files needed for the install process itself.
          Many mirrors also contain the ISO images necessary to
          create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.</p>

          <p>Being a largely-volunteer effort, the FreeBSD Project
          is always happy to have extra hands willing to
          help--there are already far more desired enhancements
          than there is time to implement them. To contact the

          Submitting Problem Reports</a></h2>

          <p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are
          always valued--please do not hesitate to report any
          problems you may find. Bug reports with attached fixes
          are of course even more welcome.</p>

          <p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a
          machine with Internet mail connectivity is to use the <a

          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span

          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html"
          target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html</a>.
          ``Problem Reports'' (PRs) submitted in this way will be
          filed and their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers
          will do their best to respond to all reported bugs as
          soon as possible. <a

          on the FreeBSD Web site; this list is useful to see what
          potential problems other users have encountered.</p>

          <p>Note that <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span

          is a shell script that should be easy to move even onto a
          non-FreeBSD system. Using this interface is highly
          preferred. If, for some reason, you are unable to use <a

          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span

          <p>As with almost all UNIX-like operating systems,
          FreeBSD comes with a set of on-line manual pages,
          accessed through the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span
          class="REFENTRYTITLE">man</span>(1)</span></a> command or
          through the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi"
          target="_top">hypertext manual pages gateway</a> on the
          FreeBSD Web site. In general, the manual pages provide
          information on the different commands and APIs available
          to the FreeBSD user.</p>

          <p>In some cases, manual pages are written to give
          information on particular topics. Notable examples of
          such manual pages are <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span
          class="REFENTRYTITLE">tuning</span>(7)</span></a> (a
          guide to performance tuning), <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=security&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span
          class="REFENTRYTITLE">security</span>(7)</span></a> (an
          introduction to FreeBSD security), and <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span
          class="REFENTRYTITLE">style</span>(9)</span></a> (a style
          guide to kernel coding).</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN158" name="AEN158">4.3 Books
          and Articles</a></h2>

          <p>Two highly-useful collections of FreeBSD-related
          information, maintained by the FreeBSD Project, are the
          FreeBSD Handbook and FreeBSD FAQ (Frequently Asked
          Questions document). On-line versions of the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
           target="_top">Handbook</a> and <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/"
           target="_top">FAQ</a> are always available from the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/docs.html"
          target="_top">FreeBSD Documentation page</a> or its
          mirrors. If you install the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
          distribution set, you can use a Web browser to read the
          Handbook and FAQ locally.</p>

          <p>A number of on-line books and articles, also
          maintained by the FreeBSD Project, cover
          more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics. This material
          spans a wide range of topics, from effective use of the
          mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other
          operating systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like
          the Handbook and FAQ, these documents are available from
          the FreeBSD Documentation Page or in the <tt
          class="FILENAME">doc</tt> distribution set.</p>

          <p>A listing of other books and documents about FreeBSD
          can be found in the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html"
           target="_top">bibliography</a> of the FreeBSD Handbook.
          Because of FreeBSD's strong UNIX heritage, many other
          articles and books written for UNIX systems are
          applicable as well, some of which are also listed in the
          bibliography.</p>

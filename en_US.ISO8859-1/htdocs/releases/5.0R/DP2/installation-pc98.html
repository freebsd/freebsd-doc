        <p>This section documents the process of installing a new
        distribution of FreeBSD. These instructions pay particular
        emphasis to the process of obtaining the FreeBSD 5.0-DP2
        distribution and to beginning the installation procedure.
        The <a href=

         target="_top">FreeBSD Handbook</a> provides more in-depth
        information about the installation program itself,
        including a guided walkthrough with screenshots.</p>

        <p>If you are upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD,
        please see <a href="#UPGRADING">Section 3</a> for
        instructions on upgrading.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="GETTING-STARTED">1.1 Getting
          Started</a></h2>

          <p>Probably the most important pre-installation step that
          can be taken is that of reading the various instruction
          documents provided with FreeBSD. A roadmap of documents
          pertaining to this release of FreeBSD can be found in <tt
          class="FILENAME">README.TXT</tt>, which can usually be
          found in the same location as this file; most of these
          documents, such as the release notes and the hardware
          compatibility list, are also accessible in the
          Documentation menu of the installer.</p>

          <p>Note that on-line versions of the FreeBSD <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/"
          target="_top">FAQ</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
           target="_top">Handbook</a> are also available from the
          <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">FreeBSD
          Project Web site</a>, if you have an Internet
          connection.</p>

          <p>This collection of documents may seem daunting, but
          the time spent reading them will likely be saved many
          times over. Being familiar with what resources are
          available can also be helpful in the event of problems
          during installation.</p>

          <p>The best laid plans sometimes go awry, so if you run
          into trouble take a look at <a href="#TROUBLE">Section
          4</a>, which contains valuable troubleshooting
          information. You should also read an updated copy of <tt
          class="FILENAME">ERRATA.TXT</tt> before installing, since
          this will alert you to any problems which have reported
          in the interim for your particular release.</p>

          Requirements</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD for the NEC PC-98x1 requires a 386 or better
          processor to run (sorry, there is no support for 286
          processors) and at least 5 megs of RAM to install and 4
          megs of RAM to run. You will need at least 100MB of free
          hard drive space for the most minimal installation. See
          below for ways of shrinking existing DOS partitions in
          order to install FreeBSD.</p>

          <p>If you are not familiar with configuring hardware for
          FreeBSD, you should be sure to read the <tt class=

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="FLOPPIES">1.3 Floppy Disk
          Image Instructions</a></h2>

          <p>Depending on how you choose to install FreeBSD, you
          may need to create a set of floppy disks (usually two) to
          begin the installation process. This section briefly
          describes how to create these disks, either from a CDROM
          installation or from the Internet. Note that in the
          common case of installing FreeBSD from CDROM, on a
          machine that supports bootable CDROMs, the steps outlined
          in this section will not be needed and can be
          skipped.</p>

          <p>For a normal CDROM or network installation, all you
          need to copy onto actual floppies from the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/</tt> directory are the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> images (for 1.44MB floppies)
          or <tt class="FILENAME">kern-small.flp</tt> and <tt
          class="FILENAME">mfsroot-small.flp</tt> images (for 1.2MB
          floppies).</p>

          <p>Getting these images over the network is easy. Simply
          fetch the <tt class="REPLACEABLE"><i>release</i></tt><tt
          class="FILENAME">/floppies/kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "REPLACEABLE"><i>release</i></tt><tt class=
          "FILENAME">/floppies/mfsroot.flp</tt> files from <a href=
          "http://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">http://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/</a> or one of the
          many mirrors listed at <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
           target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or
          on the <a href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a> Web pages.</p>

          <p>Get two blank, freshly formatted floppies and image
          copy <tt class="FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> onto one and <tt
          class="FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> onto the other. These
          images are <span class="emphasis"><i class=
          "EMPHASIS">not</i></span> DOS files. You cannot simply
          copy them to a DOS or UFS floppy as regular files, you
          need to ``image'' copy them to the floppy with <tt class=
          "FILENAME">rawrite.exe</tt> under DOS (see the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">tools</tt> directory on your CDROM or FreeBSD
          FTP mirror) or the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">dd</span>(1)</span></a> command in
          UNIX.</p>

          <p>For example, to create the kernel floppy image from
          DOS, you'd do something like this:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">A&#62;</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>rawrite</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>Assuming that you'd copied <tt class=
          "FILENAME">rawrite.exe</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> into a directory somewhere. You
          would do the same for <tt class=
          "FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt>, of course.</p>

          <p>If you're creating the boot floppy from a UNIX
          machine, you may find that:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>dd if=floppies/kern.flp of=/dev/rfd0.1440</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>or</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>dd if=floppies/kern-small.flp of=/dev/rfd0.1200</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>work well, depending on your hardware and operating
          system environment (different versions of UNIX have
          different names for the floppy drive).</p>

          Installing FreeBSD from CDROM or the Internet</a></h2>

          <p>The easiest type of installation is from CDROM. If you
          have a supported CDROM drive and a FreeBSD installation
          CDROM, there is a next way of starting the installation
          from it:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Build a set of FreeBSD boot floppies from the <tt
              class="FILENAME">floppies/</tt> directory in every
              FreeBSD distribution. Read <a href=
              "#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a> for more information on
              creating the bootable floppies under different
              operating systems. Then you simply boot from the
              first floppy and you should soon be in the FreeBSD
              installation.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p>If you don't have a CDROM and would like to simply
          install over the net using PPP, SLIP or a dedicated
          connection. You should start the installation by building
          a set of FreeBSD boot floppies from the files <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/mfsroot.flp</tt> using the
          instructions found in <a href="#FLOPPIES">Section
          1.3</a>. Restart your computer using the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> disk; when prompted, insert the
          <tt class="FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> disk. Then, please
          go to <a href="#FTPNFS">Section 1.5.5</a> for additional
          tips on installing via FTP or NFS.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN205">1.5 Detail on various
          installation types</a></h2>

          <p>Once you've gotten yourself to the initial
          installation screen somehow, you should be able to follow
          the various menu prompts and go from there. If you've
          never used the FreeBSD installation before, you are also
          encouraged to read some of the documentation in the
          Documentation submenu as well as the general ``Usage''
          instructions on the first menu.</p>

          <div class="NOTE">
            <blockquote class="NOTE">
              <p><b>Note:</b> If you get stuck at a screen, press

          </div>

          <p>If you've never installed FreeBSD before, or even if
          you have, the ``Standard'' installation mode is the most
          recommended since it makes sure that you'll visit all the
          various important checklist items along the way. If
          you're much more comfortable with the FreeBSD
          installation process and know <span class="emphasis"><i
          class="EMPHASIS">exactly</i></span> what you want to do,
          use the ``Express'' or ``Custom'' installation options.
          If you're upgrading an existing system, use the
          ``Upgrade'' option.</p>

          <p>The FreeBSD installer supports the direct use of
          floppy, DOS, tape, CDROM, FTP, NFS and UFS partitions as
          installation media; further tips on installing from each
          type of media are listed below.</p>

                <p>If you would rather use NFS to export the CDROM
                directly to the machine(s) you'll be installing
                from, you need to first add an entry to the <tt
                class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> file (on the
                machine with the CDROM drive). The example below
                allows the machine <tt class=

                directly via NFS during installation:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">

                <p>The machine with the CDROM must also be
                configured as an NFS server, of course, and if
                you're not sure how to do that then an NFS
                installation is probably not the best choice for

            from Floppies</a></h3>

            <p>If you must install from floppy disks, either due to
            unsupported hardware or just because you enjoy doing
            things the hard way, you must first prepare some

            <p>First, make your boot floppies as described in <a

            <p>Second, peruse <a href="#LAYOUT">Section 2</a> and

            section since it describes which files you're going to
            need to put onto floppy and which you can safely
            skip.</p>

            <p>Next you will need, at minimum, as many 1.44MB
            floppies as it takes to hold all files in the <tt

            <p>If you're creating the floppies from another FreeBSD
            machine, a format is still not a bad idea though you
            don't need to put a DOS filesystem on each floppy. You
            can use the <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">disklabel</span>(8)</span></a> and <a
            href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=newfs&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">newfs</span>(8)</span></a> commands to
            put a UFS filesystem on a floppy, as the following
            sequence of commands illustrates:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=

</pre>

            <p>After you've formatted the floppies for DOS or UFS,
            you'll need to copy the files onto them. The
            distribution files are split into chunks conveniently
            sized so that 5 of them will fit on a conventional
            1.44MB floppy. Go through all your floppies, packing as
            many files as will fit on each one, until you've got
            all the distributions you want packed up in this
            fashion. Each distribution should go into its own
            subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.: <tt class=
            "FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.inf</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.aa</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.ab</tt>, ...</p>

                <p><b>Important:</b> The <tt class=

                installation program in order to figure out how
                many additional pieces to look for when fetching

            <p>To prepare for installation from an MS-DOS partition
            you should simply copy the files from the distribution

            (<tt class="DEVICENAME">A:</tt>). For example, to do a
            minimal installation of FreeBSD from DOS using files
            copied from the CDROM, you might do something like
            this:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">A:\&#62;</tt> <tt class=

            <p>Assuming that <tt class="DEVICENAME">E:</tt> was

            <p>For as many distributions as you wish to install

            requirement.</p>

            <p>Once you've copied the directories, you can simply

              <p>SLIP support is rather primitive, and is limited
              primarily to hard-wired links, such as a serial cable
              running between two computers. The link must be
              hard-wired because the SLIP installation doesn't
              currently offer a dialing capability. If you need to
              dial out with a modem or otherwise dialog with the
              link before connecting to it, then I recommend that
              the PPP utility be used instead.</p>

              <p>If you're using PPP, make sure that you have your
              Internet Service Provider's IP address and DNS
              information handy as you'll need to know it fairly
              early in the installation process. You may also need
              to know your own IP address, though PPP supports
              dynamic address negotiation and may be able to pick
              up this information directly from your ISP if they
              support it.</p>

              <p>You will also need to know how to use the various
              ``AT commands'' for dialing out with your particular

              simple terminal emulator.</p>

              parallel cable in this way and you can generally just

              <p>FreeBSD supports many common Ethernet cards; a
              table of supported cards is provided as part of the
              FreeBSD Hardware Notes (see <tt class=
              "FILENAME">HARDWARE.TXT</tt> in the Documentation
              menu on the boot floppy or the top level directory of
              the CDROM). If you are using one of the supported
              PCMCIA Ethernet cards, also be sure that it's plugged
              in <span class="emphasis"><i class=
              "EMPHASIS">before</i></span> the laptop is powered
              on. FreeBSD does not, unfortunately, currently
              support ``hot insertion'' of PCMCIA cards during
              installation.</p>

              <p>You will also need to know your IP address on the
              network, the <tt class="OPTION">netmask</tt> value
              for your subnet and the name of your machine. Your
              system administrator can tell you which values are
              appropriate to your particular network setup. If you
              will be referring to other hosts by name rather than
              IP address, you'll also need a name server and
              possibly the address of a gateway (if you're using
              PPP, it's your provider's IP address) to use in
              talking to it. If you want to install by FTP via an
              HTTP proxy (see below), you will also need the
              proxy's address.</p>

              <p>If you do not know the answers to these questions
              then you should really probably talk to your system
              administrator <span class="emphasis"><i class=

              of installation. Using a randomly chosen IP address
              or netmask on a live network is almost guaranteed not
              to work, and will probably result in a lecture from
              said system administrator.</p>

              <p>Once you have a network connection of some sort

              <p>NFS installation is fairly straight-forward:
              Simply copy the FreeBSD distribution files you want
              onto a server somewhere and then point the NFS media
              selection at it.</p>

              <p>If this server supports only ``privileged port''
              access (this is generally the default for Sun and
              Linux workstations), you will need to set this option
              in the Options menu before installation can
              proceed.</p>

              <p>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which
              suffers from very slow transfer rates, you may also
              wish to toggle the appropriate Options flag.</p>

              <p>In order for NFS installation to work, the server
              must also support ``subdir mounts'', e.g. if your
              FreeBSD distribution directory lives on <tt class=
              "FILENAME">wiggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>,
              then <tt class="HOSTID">wiggy</tt> will have to allow
              the direct mounting of <tt class=
              "FILENAME">/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>, not just
              <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> or <tt class=

              <p>In FreeBSD's <tt class=

              by the <tt class="OPTION">-alldirs</tt> option. Other

              that you don't have this properly enabled.</p>

              Installation tips</a></h4>

              <p>FTP installation may be done from any mirror site
              containing a reasonably up-to-date version of
              FreeBSD. A full menu of reasonable choices for almost
              any location in the world is provided in the FTP site
              menu during installation.</p>

              <p>If you are installing from some other FTP site not
              listed in this menu, or you are having troubles
              getting your name server configured properly, you can
              also specify your own URL by selecting the ``URL''
              choice in that menu. A URL can contain a hostname or
              an IP address, so something like the following would
              work in the absence of a name server:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    ftp://216.66.64.162/pub/FreeBSD/releases/pc98/4.2-RELEASE
</pre>

              <p>There are three FTP installation modes you can
              use:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>FTP: This method uses the standard ``Active''
                  mode for transfers, in which the server initiates
                  a connection to the client. This will not work
                  through most firewalls but will often work best
                  with older FTP servers that do not support
                  passive mode. If your connection hangs with
                  passive mode, try this one.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>FTP Passive: This sets the FTP "Passive" mode
                  which prevents the server from opening
                  connections to the client. This option is best
                  for users to pass through firewalls that do not
                  allow incoming connections on random port
                  addresses.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>FTP via an HTTP proxy: This option instructs
                  FreeBSD to use HTTP to connect to a proxy for all
                  FTP operations. The proxy will translate the
                  requests and send them to the FTP server. This
                  allows the user to pass through firewalls that do
                  not allow FTP at all, but offer an HTTP proxy.
                  You must specify the hostname of the proxy in
                  addition to the FTP server.</p>

                  <p>In the rare case that you have an FTP proxy
                  that does not go through HTTP, you can specify
                  the URL as something like:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="USERINPUT"><b>ftp://foo.bar.com:<tt class=

                  <p>In the URL above, <tt class=

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="LAYOUT">2 Distribution
        Format</a></h1>

        <p>A typical FreeBSD distribution directory looks something
        like this (exact details may vary depending on version,
        architecture, and other factors):</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    ERRATA.HTM      README.TXT      compat1x        dict            kernel
    ERRATA.TXT      RELNOTES.HTM    compat20        doc             manpages
    HARDWARE.HTM    RELNOTES.TXT    compat21        docbook.css     packages
    HARDWARE.TXT    base            compat22        filename.txt    ports
    INSTALL.HTM     boot            compat3x        floppies        proflibs
    INSTALL.TXT     catpages        compat4x        games           src
    README.HTM      cdrom.inf       crypto          info            tools
</pre>

        <p>If you want to do a CDROM, FTP or NFS installation from
        this distribution directory, all you need to do is make the
        1.44MB boot floppies from the floppies directory (see <a
        href="#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a> for instructions on how to
        do this), boot them and follow the instructions. The rest
        of the data needed during the installation will be obtained
        automatically based on your selections. If you've never
        installed FreeBSD before, you also want to read the
        entirety of this document (the installation instructions)
        file.</p>

        <p>If you're trying to do some other type of installation
        or are merely curious about how a distribution is
        organized, what follows is a more thorough description of
        some of these items in more detail:</p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">*.TXT</tt> and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">*.HTM</tt> files contain documentation (for
            example, this document is contained in both <tt class=
            "FILENAME">INSTALL.TXT</tt> and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">INSTALL.HTM</tt>) and should be read before
            starting an installation. The <tt class=
            "FILENAME">*.TXT</tt> files are plain text, while the
            <tt class="FILENAME">*.HTM</tt> files are HTML files
            that can be read by almost any Web browser. Some
            distributions may contain documentation in other
            formats as well, such as PDF or PostScript.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><tt class="FILENAME">docbook.css</tt> is a Cascading
            Style Sheet (CSS) file used by some Web browsers for
            formatting the HTML documentation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">base</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">catpages</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">crypto</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">dict</tt>,
            <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">games</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">info</tt>,
            <tt class="FILENAME">manpages</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">proflibs</tt>, and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">src</tt> directories contain the primary
            distribution components of FreeBSD itself and are split
            into smaller files for easy packing onto floppies
            (should that be necessary).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">compat1x</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat20</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat21</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat22</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat3x</tt>, and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat4x</tt> directories contain
            distributions for compatibility with older releases and
            are distributed as single gzip'd tar files - they can
            be installed during release time or later by running
            their <tt class="FILENAME">install.sh</tt> scripts.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">floppies/</tt> subdirectory
            contains the floppy installation images; further
            information on using them can be found in <a href=
            "#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">packages</tt> and <tt
            class="FILENAME">ports</tt> directories contain the
            FreeBSD Packages and Ports Collections. Packages may be
            installed from the packages directory by running the
            command:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt><tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>/stand/sysinstall configPackages</b></tt>
</pre>

            <p>Packages can also be installed by feeding individual
            filenames in <tt class="FILENAME">packages</tt>/ to the
            <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">pkg_add</span>(1)</span></a>
            command.</p>

            <p>The Ports Collection may be installed like any other
            distribution and requires about 100MB unpacked. More
            information on the ports collection may be obtained
            from <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/" target=
            "_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/</a> or locally
            from <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/share/doc/handbook</tt>
            if you've installed the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
            distribution.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Last of all, the <tt class="FILENAME">tools</tt>
            directory contains various DOS tools for discovering
            disk geometries, installing boot managers and the like.
            It is purely optional and provided only for user
            convenience.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>A typical distribution directory (for example, the <tt
        class="FILENAME">info</tt> distribution) looks like this
        internally:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    CHECKSUM.MD5    info.ab         info.ad         info.inf        install.sh
    info.aa         info.ac         info.ae         info.mtree
</pre>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">CHECKSUM.MD5</tt> file contains
        MD5 signatures for each file, should data corruption be
        suspected, and is purely for reference. It is not used by
        the actual installation and does not need to be copied with
        the rest of the distribution files. The <tt class=
        "FILENAME">info.a*</tt> files are split, gzip'd tar files,
        the contents of which can be viewed by doing:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>cat info.a* | tar tvzf -</b></tt>
</pre>

        <p>During installation, they are automatically concatenated
        and extracted by the installation procedure.</p>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">info.inf</tt> file is also
        necessary since it is read by the installation program in
        order to figure out how many pieces to look for when
        fetching and concatenating the distribution. When putting
        distributions onto floppies, the <tt class=
        "FILENAME">.inf</tt> file <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">must</i></span> occupy the first floppy of each
        distribution set!</p>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">info.mtree</tt> file is another
        non-essential file which is provided for user reference. It
        contains the MD5 signatures of the <span class=
        "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">unpacked</i></span>
        distribution files and can be later used with the <a href=
        "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mtree&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
        <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
        "REFENTRYTITLE">mtree</span>(8)</span></a> program to
        verify the installation permissions and checksums against
        any possible modifications to the file. When used with the
        <tt class="FILENAME">base</tt> distribution, this can be an
        excellent way of detecting trojan horse attacks on your
        system.</p>

        <p>Finally, the <tt class="FILENAME">install.sh</tt> file
        is for use by those who want to install the distribution
        after installation time. To install the info distribution
        from CDROM after a system was installed, for example, you'd
        do:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>cd /cdrom/info</b></tt>
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>sh install.sh</b></tt>

            rule, the <tt class="LITERAL">base</tt> distribution

            installed. Other distributions may be selected beyond
            those originally installed if the administrator wishes
            to add additional functionality.</p>

           target="_top">The Cutting Edge</a> in the FreeBSD
          Handbook. This procedure involves rebuilding all of
          FreeBSD from source code. It requires reliable network
          connectivity, extra disk space, and time, but has
          advantages for networks and other more complex
          installations. This is roughly the same procedure as is
          used for track the -STABLE or -CURRENT development

          <p>FreeBSD features a ``Fixit'' option in the top menu of
          the boot floppy. To use it, you will also need either a
          <tt class="FILENAME">fixit.flp</tt> image floppy,
          generated in the same fashion as the boot floppy, or the
          ``live filesystem'' CDROM; typically the second CDROM in
          a multi-disc FreeBSD distribution.</p>

          <p>To invoke fixit, simply boot the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> floppy, choose the ``Fixit''
          item and insert the fixit floppy or CDROM when asked. You
          will then be placed into a shell with a wide variety of
          commands available (in the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">/stand</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">/mnt2/stand</tt> directories) for checking,
          repairing and examining filesystems and their contents.
          Some UNIX administration experience <span class=

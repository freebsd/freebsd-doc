          <p>This document gives a brief introduction to FreeBSD
          5.0-DP1. It includes some information on how to obtain
          FreeBSD, a listing of various ways to contact the FreeBSD

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN13">1 Introduction</a></h1>

        <p>FreeBSD 5.0-DP1 is a ``developer preview'', which is
        based on the state of FreeBSD 5-CURRENT on 15 March 2002. A
        small number of changes have been made to the system,
        primarily to improve its stability so that more of its
        features can be used and tested.</p>

        <p>There are two main goals behind FreeBSD 5.0-DP1
        (``Developer Preview 1''). The first is to give the wider
        FreeBSD community a preview of some of the new features of
        5.0-RELEASE, which is scheduled for release late in 2002.
        The second goal of the developer preview is solicit test
        reports and feedback on both new and old features.</p>

        <p>This developer preview is not for production use; it
        contains known bugs and instabilities that should be fixed
        before FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE. It is best considered a
        ``polished snapshot''. Users testing 5.0-DP1 are highly
        encouraged to read the errata file, which lists some of the
        known problems, as well as areas of the system that could
        benefit from some extra attention during testing.</p>

        <div class="SECT2">

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN21">1.1 About
          FreeBSD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite
          for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen ``x86'' based PC
          hardware, Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers, and
          UltraSPARC machines. Versions for the IA64 and PowerPC
          architectures are currently under development as well.
          FreeBSD works with a wide variety of peripherals and
          configurations and can be used for everything from
          software development to games to Internet Service
          Provision.</p>

          <p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need
          to run such a system, including full source code for the
          kernel and all utilities in the base distribution. With
          the source distribution installed, you can literally
          recompile the entire system from scratch with one
          command, making it ideal for students, researchers, or
          users who simply want to see how it all works.</p>

          <p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
          ``Ports Collection'') is also provided to make it easy to
          obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
          utilities for FreeBSD. Each ``port'' consists of a set of
          scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a
          piece of software, with a single command. Over 6,600
          ports, from editors to programming languages to graphical
          applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive
          operating environment that extends far beyond what's
          provided by many commercial versions of UNIX. Most ports
          are also available as pre-compiled ``packages'', which
          can be quickly installed from the installation
          program.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN30">1.2 Target
          Audience</a></h2>

          <p>This snapshot is aimed primarily at early adopters and
          various other users who want to get involved with the
          ongoing development of FreeBSD. While the FreeBSD
          development team tries its best to ensure that each
          snapshot works as advertised, 5-CURRENT is very much a
          work-in-progress.</p>

          <p>The basic requirements for using this snapshot are
          technical proficiency with FreeBSD and an understanding
          of the ongoing development process of FreeBSD 5-CURRENT
          (as discussed on the FreeBSD-current mailing list <tt
          class="EMAIL">&#60;<a href=
          "mailto:freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</tt>).</p>

          <p>For those more interested in doing business with
          FreeBSD than in experimenting with new FreeBSD
          technology, formal releases (such as 4.5-RELEASE) are
          frequently more appropriate. Releases undergo a period of
          testing and quality assurance checking to ensure high
          reliability and dependability.</p>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN36">2 Obtaining
        FreeBSD</a></h1>

        <p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This
        section focuses on those ways that are primarily useful for
        obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than
        updating an existing installation.</p>

        <div class="SECT2">
          <hr>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN39">2.1 CDROM and
          DVD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM
          or DVD from several publishers. This is frequently the
          most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new
          installations, as it provides a convenient way to quickly
          reinstall the system if necessary. Some distributions
          include some of the optional, precompiled ``packages''
          from the FreeBSD Ports Collection.</p>

          <p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the
          project are listed in the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN46">2.2 FTP</a></h2>

          <p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of
          its optional packages from <a href=
          "ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the official
          FreeBSD release site, or any of its ``mirrors''.</p>

          <p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in
          the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
           target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or
          on the <a href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a> Web pages.
          Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which
          to download the distribution is highly recommended.</p>

          <p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact
          <tt class="EMAIL">&#60;<a href=
          "mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</tt>
          for more details on becoming an official mirror site. You
          can also find useful information for mirror sites at the
          <a href=

           target="_top">Mirroring FreeBSD</a> article.</p>

          <p>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images
          necessary to begin an installation, as well as the
          distribution files needed for the install process itself.
          Many mirrors also contain the ISO images necessary to
          create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.</p>

          <p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are

          <p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a

          Reports'' (PRs) submitted in this way will be filed and
          their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers will do
          their best to respond to all reported bugs as soon as

          FreeBSD comes with a set of on-line manual pages,
          accessed through the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">man</span>(1)</span></a> command or
          through the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi"
          target="_top">hypertext manual pages gateway</a> on the
          FreeBSD Web site. In general, the manual pages provide
          information on the different commands and APIs available
          to the FreeBSD user.</p>

          <p>In some cases, manual pages are written to given
          information on particular topics. Notable examples of
          such manual pages are <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">tuning</span>(7)</span></a> (a guide to
          performance tuning), <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=security&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">security</span>(7)</span></a> (an
          introduction to FreeBSD security), and <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">style</span>(9)</span></a> (a style guide
          to kernel coding).</p>

          Articles</a></h2>

          <p>Two highly-useful collections of FreeBSD-related
          information, maintained by the FreeBSD Project, are the
          FreeBSD Handbook and FreeBSD FAQ (Frequently Asked
          Questions document). On-line versions of the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
           target="_top">Handbook</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/"
          target="_top">FAQ</a> are always available from the <a
          href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/docs.html" target=
          "_top">FreeBSD Documentation page</a> or its mirrors. If
          you install the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
          distribution set, you can use a Web browser to read the
          Handbook and FAQ locally.</p>

          <p>A number of on-line books and articles, also
          maintained by the FreeBSD Project, cover
          more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics. This material
          spans a wide range of topics, from effective use of the
          mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other
          operating systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like
          the Handbook and FAQ, these documents are available from
          the FreeBSD Documentation Page or in the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">doc</tt> distribution set.</p>

          <p>A listing of other books and documents about FreeBSD
          can be found in the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html"
           target="_top">bibliography</a> of the FreeBSD Handbook.
          Because of FreeBSD's strong UNIX heritage, many other
          articles and books written for UNIX systems are
          applicable as well, some of which are also listed in the
          bibliography.</p>

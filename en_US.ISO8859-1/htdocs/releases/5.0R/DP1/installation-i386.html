        FreeBSD</a></h1>

        <p>This section documents the process of installing a new
        distribution of FreeBSD. These instructions pay particular
        emphasis to the process of obtaining the FreeBSD 5.0-DP1
        distribution and to beginning the installation procedure.
        The <a href=

         target="_top">FreeBSD Handbook</a> provides more in-depth
        information about the installation program itself,
        including a guided walkthrough with screenshots.</p>

        <p>If you are upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD,
        please see <a href="#UPGRADING">Section 3</a> for
        instructions on upgrading.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="GETTING-STARTED">1.1 Getting
          Started</a></h2>

          <p>Probably the most important pre-installation step that
          can be taken is that of reading the various instruction
          documents provided with FreeBSD. A roadmap of documents
          pertaining to this release of FreeBSD can be found in <tt
          class="FILENAME">README.TXT</tt>, which can usually be
          found in the same location as this file; most of these
          documents, such as the release notes and the hardware
          compatibility list, are also accessible in the
          Documentation menu of the installer.</p>

          <p>Note that on-line versions of the FreeBSD <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/"
          target="_top">FAQ</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
           target="_top">Handbook</a> are also available from the
          <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">FreeBSD
          Project Web site</a>, if you have an Internet
          connection.</p>

          <p>This collection of documents may seem daunting, but
          the time spent reading them will likely be saved many
          times over. Being familiar with what resources are
          available can also be helpful in the event of problems
          during installation.</p>

          <p>The best laid plans sometimes go awry, so if you run
          into trouble take a look at <a href="#TROUBLE">Section
          4</a>, which contains valuable troubleshooting
          information. You should also read an updated copy of <tt
          class="FILENAME">ERRATA.TXT</tt> before installing, since
          this will alert you to any problems which have reported
          in the interim for your particular release.</p>

          Requirements</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD for the IA-32 requires a 386 or better
          processor to run (sorry, there is no support for 286
          processors) and at least 5 megs of RAM to install and 4
          megs of RAM to run. You will need at least 100MB of free
          hard drive space for the most minimal installation. See
          below for ways of shrinking existing DOS partitions in
          order to install FreeBSD.</p>

          <p>If you are not familiar with configuring hardware for
          FreeBSD, you should be sure to read the <tt class=

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="FLOPPIES">1.3 Floppy Disk
          Image Instructions</a></h2>

          <p>Depending on how you choose to install FreeBSD, you
          may need to create a set of floppy disks (usually two) to
          begin the installation process. This section briefly
          describes how to create these disks, either from a CDROM
          installation or from the Internet. Note that in the
          common case of installing FreeBSD from CDROM, on a
          machine that supports bootable CDROMs, the steps outlined
          in this section will not be needed and can be
          skipped.</p>

          <p>For a normal CDROM or network installation, all you
          need to copy onto actual floppies from the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/</tt> directory are the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> images (for 1.44MB
          floppies).</p>

          <p>Getting these images over the network is easy. Simply
          fetch the <tt class="REPLACEABLE"><i>release</i></tt><tt
          class="FILENAME">/floppies/kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "REPLACEABLE"><i>release</i></tt><tt class=
          "FILENAME">/floppies/mfsroot.flp</tt> files from <a href=
          "ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/" target=
          "_top">ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/</a> or one
          of the many mirrors listed at <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
           target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or
          on the <a href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a> Web pages.</p>

          <p>Get two blank, freshly formatted floppies and image
          copy <tt class="FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> onto one and <tt
          class="FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> onto the other. These
          images are <span class="emphasis"><i class=
          "EMPHASIS">not</i></span> DOS files. You cannot simply
          copy them to a DOS or UFS floppy as regular files, you
          need to ``image'' copy them to the floppy with <tt class=
          "FILENAME">fdimage.exe</tt> under DOS (see the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">tools</tt> directory on your CDROM or FreeBSD
          FTP mirror) or the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
          "REFENTRYTITLE">dd</span>(1)</span></a> command in
          UNIX.</p>

          <p>For example, to create the kernel floppy image from
          DOS, you'd do something like this:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">C&#62;</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>fdimage kern.flp a:</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>Assuming that you'd copied <tt class=
          "FILENAME">fdimage.exe</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> into a directory somewhere. You
          would do the same for <tt class=
          "FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt>, of course.</p>

          <p>If you're creating the boot floppy from a UNIX
          machine, you may find that:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>dd if=floppies/kern.flp of=/dev/rfd0</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>or</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>dd if=floppies/kern.flp of=/dev/floppy</b></tt>
</pre>

          <p>work well, depending on your hardware and operating
          system environment (different versions of UNIX have
          different names for the floppy drive).</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="START-INSTALLATION">1.4
          Installing FreeBSD from CDROM or the Internet</a></h2>

          <p>The easiest type of installation is from CDROM. If you
          have a supported CDROM drive and a FreeBSD installation
          CDROM, there are 2 ways of starting the installation from
          it:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>If your system supports bootable CDROM media
              (usually an option which can be selectively enabled
              in the controller's setup menu or in the PC BIOS for
              some systems) and you have it enabled, FreeBSD
              supports the ``El Torito'' bootable CD standard.
              Simply put the installation CD in your CDROM drive
              and boot the system to begin installation.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Build a set of FreeBSD boot floppies from the <tt
              class="FILENAME">floppies/</tt> directory in every
              FreeBSD distribution. Either simply use the <tt
              class="FILENAME">makeflp.bat</tt> script from DOS or
              read <a href="#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a> for more
              information on creating the bootable floppies under
              different operating systems. Then you simply boot
              from the first floppy and you should soon be in the
              FreeBSD installation.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p>If you don't have a CDROM (or your computer does not
          support booting from CDROM) and would like to simply
          install over the net using PPP, SLIP or a dedicated
          connection. You should start the installation by building
          a set of FreeBSD boot floppies from the files <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/kern.flp</tt> and <tt class=
          "FILENAME">floppies/mfsroot.flp</tt> using the
          instructions found in <a href="#FLOPPIES">Section
          1.3</a>. Restart your computer using the <tt class=
          "FILENAME">kern.flp</tt> disk; when prompted, insert the
          <tt class="FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> disk. Then, please
          go to <a href="#FTPNFS">Section 1.5.5</a> for additional
          tips on installing via FTP or NFS.</p>

          installation types</a></h2>

          <p>Once you've gotten yourself to the initial
          installation screen somehow, you should be able to follow
          the various menu prompts and go from there. If you've
          never used the FreeBSD installation before, you are also
          encouraged to read some of the documentation in the
          Documentation submenu as well as the general ``Usage''
          instructions on the first menu.</p>

          <div class="NOTE">

          </div>

          <p>If you've never installed FreeBSD before, or even if
          you have, the ``Standard'' installation mode is the most
          recommended since it makes sure that you'll visit all the
          various important checklist items along the way. If
          you're much more comfortable with the FreeBSD
          installation process and know <span class="emphasis"><i
          class="EMPHASIS">exactly</i></span> what you want to do,
          use the ``Express'' or ``Custom'' installation options.
          If you're upgrading an existing system, use the
          ``Upgrade'' option.</p>

          <p>The FreeBSD installer supports the direct use of
          floppy, DOS, tape, CDROM, FTP, NFS and UFS partitions as
          installation media; further tips on installing from each
          type of media are listed below.</p>

                <p>If you would rather use NFS to export the CDROM
                directly to the machine(s) you'll be installing
                from, you need to first add an entry to the <tt
                class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> file (on the
                machine with the CDROM drive). The example below
                allows the machine <tt class=

                directly via NFS during installation:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    /cdrom          -ro             ziggy.foo.com
</pre>

                <p>The machine with the CDROM must also be
                configured as an NFS server, of course, and if
                you're not sure how to do that then an NFS
                installation is probably not the best choice for
                you unless you're willing to read up on <a href=

            from Floppies</a></h3>

            <p>If you must install from floppy disks, either due to
            unsupported hardware or just because you enjoy doing
            things the hard way, you must first prepare some
            floppies for the install.</p>

            <p>First, make your boot floppies as described in <a
            href="#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a>.</p>

            <p>Second, peruse <a href="#LAYOUT">Section 2</a> and
            pay special attention to the ``Distribution Format''
            section since it describes which files you're going to
            need to put onto floppy and which you can safely
            skip.</p>

            <p>Next you will need, at minimum, as many 1.44MB
            floppies as it takes to hold all files in the <tt
            class="FILENAME">bin</tt> (binary distribution)
            directory. If you're preparing these floppies under
            DOS, then these floppies <span class="emphasis"><i

            <p>If you're creating the floppies from another FreeBSD
            machine, a format is still not a bad idea though you
            don't need to put a DOS filesystem on each floppy. You
            can use the <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=

            put a UFS filesystem on a floppy, as the following
            sequence of commands illustrates:</p>

            <p>After you've formatted the floppies for DOS or UFS,
            you'll need to copy the files onto them. The
            distribution files are split into chunks conveniently
            sized so that 5 of them will fit on a conventional
            1.44MB floppy. Go through all your floppies, packing as
            many files as will fit on each one, until you've got
            all the distributions you want packed up in this
            fashion. Each distribution should go into its own
            subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.: <tt class=
            "FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.inf</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.aa</tt>, <tt class=

            <p>To prepare for installation from an MS-DOS partition

            (<tt class="DEVICENAME">C:</tt>). For example, to do a
            minimal installation of FreeBSD from DOS using files
            copied from the CDROM, you might do something like
            this:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">C:\&#62;</tt> <tt class=

            <p>Assuming that <tt class="DEVICENAME">E:</tt> was

            <p>For as many distributions as you wish to install

            requirement.</p>

            <p>Once you've copied the directories, you can simply

              <p>SLIP support is rather primitive, and is limited
              primarily to hard-wired links, such as a serial cable
              running between two computers. The link must be
              hard-wired because the SLIP installation doesn't
              currently offer a dialing capability. If you need to
              dial out with a modem or otherwise dialog with the
              link before connecting to it, then I recommend that
              the PPP utility be used instead.</p>

              <p>If you're using PPP, make sure that you have your
              Internet Service Provider's IP address and DNS
              information handy as you'll need to know it fairly
              early in the installation process. You may also need
              to know your own IP address, though PPP supports
              dynamic address negotiation and may be able to pick
              up this information directly from your ISP if they
              support it.</p>

              <p>You will also need to know how to use the various

              simple terminal emulator.</p>

              <p>FreeBSD supports many common Ethernet cards; a
              table of supported cards is provided as part of the
              FreeBSD Hardware Notes (see <tt class=
              "FILENAME">HARDWARE.TXT</tt> in the Documentation
              menu on the boot floppy or the top level directory of
              the CDROM). If you are using one of the supported
              PCMCIA Ethernet cards, also be sure that it's plugged
              in <span class="emphasis"><i class=
              "EMPHASIS">before</i></span> the laptop is powered
              on. FreeBSD does not, unfortunately, currently
              support ``hot insertion'' of PCMCIA cards during
              installation.</p>

              <p>You will also need to know your IP address on the
              network, the <tt class="OPTION">netmask</tt> value
              for your subnet and the name of your machine. Your
              system administrator can tell you which values are
              appropriate to your particular network setup. If you
              will be referring to other hosts by name rather than
              IP address, you'll also need a name server and
              possibly the address of a gateway (if you're using
              PPP, it's your provider's IP address) to use in
              talking to it. If you want to install by FTP via an
              HTTP proxy (see below), you will also need the
              proxy's address.</p>

              <p>If you do not know the answers to these questions
              then you should really probably talk to your system
              administrator <span class="emphasis"><i class=

              of installation. Using a randomly chosen IP address

              to work, and will probably result in a lecture from
              said system administrator.</p>

              <p>Once you have a network connection of some sort

              <p>NFS installation is fairly straight-forward:
              Simply copy the FreeBSD distribution files you want

              selection at it.</p>

              access (this is generally the default for Sun and
              Linux workstations), you will need to set this option
              in the Options menu before installation can
              proceed.</p>

              <p>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which
              suffers from very slow transfer rates, you may also
              wish to toggle the appropriate Options flag.</p>

              <p>In order for NFS installation to work, the server
              must also support ``subdir mounts'', e.g. if your
              FreeBSD distribution directory lives on <tt class=
              "FILENAME">wiggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>,
              then <tt class="HOSTID">wiggy</tt> will have to allow
              the direct mounting of <tt class=
              "FILENAME">/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>, not just
              <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> or <tt class=

              <p>In FreeBSD's <tt class=

              that you don't have this properly enabled.</p>

              <p>FTP installation may be done from any mirror site
              containing a reasonably up-to-date version of
              FreeBSD. A full menu of reasonable choices for almost
              any location in the world is provided in the FTP site
              menu during installation.</p>

              <p>If you are installing from some other FTP site not
              listed in this menu, or you are having troubles
              getting your name server configured properly, you can
              also specify your own URL by selecting the ``URL''
              choice in that menu. A URL can contain a hostname or
              an IP address, so something like the following would
              work in the absence of a name server:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    ftp://216.66.64.162/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.2-RELEASE
</pre>

              <p>There are three FTP installation modes you can
              use:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>FTP: This method uses the standard ``Active''
                  mode for transfers, in which the server initiates
                  a connection to the client. This will not work
                  through most firewalls but will often work best
                  with older FTP servers that do not support
                  passive mode. If your connection hangs with
                  passive mode, try this one.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>FTP Passive: This sets the FTP "Passive" mode
                  which prevents the server from opening
                  connections to the client. This option is best
                  for users to pass through firewalls that do not
                  allow incoming connections on random port
                  addresses.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>FTP via an HTTP proxy: This option instructs
                  FreeBSD to use HTTP to connect to a proxy for all
                  FTP operations. The proxy will translate the
                  requests and send them to the FTP server. This
                  allows the user to pass through firewalls that do
                  not allow FTP at all, but offer an HTTP proxy.
                  You must specify the hostname of the proxy in
                  addition to the FTP server.</p>

                  <p>In the rare case that you have an FTP proxy
                  that does not go through HTTP, you can specify
                  the URL as something like:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="USERINPUT"><b>ftp://foo.bar.com:<tt class=

            Serial Console Users</a></h3>

            <p>If you'd like to install FreeBSD on a machine using
            just a serial port (e.g. you don't have or wish to use
            a VGA card), please follow these steps:</p>

            <div class="PROCEDURE">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  <p>Connect some sort of ANSI (vt100) compatible
                  terminal or terminal emulation program to the <tt
                  class="DEVICENAME">COM1</tt> port of the PC you
                  are installing FreeBSD onto.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Unplug the keyboard (yes, that's correct!) and
                  then try to boot from floppy or the installation
                  CDROM, depending on the type of installation
                  media you have, with the keyboard unplugged.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>If you don't get any output on your serial
                  console, plug the keyboard in again and wait for
                  some beeps. If you are booting from the CDROM,
                  proceed to <a href="#HITSPACE">step 5</a> as soon
                  as you hear the beep.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>For a floppy boot, the first beep means to
                  remove the <tt class="FILENAME">kern.flp</tt>
                  floppy and insert the <tt class=
                  "FILENAME">mfsroot.flp</tt> floppy, after which
                  you should press <b class="KEYCAP">Enter</b> and
                  wait for another beep.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <a name="HITSPACE"></a>

                  <p>Hit the space bar, then enter</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="USERINPUT"><b>boot -h</b></tt>
</pre>

                  <p>and you should now definitely be seeing
                  everything on the serial port. If that still
                  doesn't work, check your serial cabling as well
                  as the settings on your terminal emulation
                  program or actual terminal device. It should be
                  set for 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>If your machine is already running DOS
                and has little or no free space available for
                FreeBSD's installation, all is not lost! You may
                find the <b class="APPLICATION">FIPS</b> utility,
                provided in the <tt class="FILENAME">tools/</tt>
                subdirectory on the FreeBSD CDROM or on the various
                FreeBSD ftp sites, to be quite useful.</p>

                <p><b class="APPLICATION">FIPS</b> allows you to
                split an existing DOS partition into two pieces,
                preserving the original partition and allowing you
                to install onto the second free piece. You first
                ``defrag'' your DOS partition, using the DOS 6.xx
                <tt class="FILENAME">DEFRAG</tt> utility or the <b
                class="APPLICATION">Norton Disk Tools</b>, then run
                FIPS. It will prompt you for the rest of the
                information it needs. Afterwards, you can reboot
                and install FreeBSD on the new partition. Also note
                that FIPS will create the second partition as a
                ``clone'' of the first, so you'll actually see that
                you now have two DOS Primary partitions where you
                formerly had one. Don't be alarmed! You can simply
                delete the extra DOS Primary partition (making sure
                it's the right one by examining its size).</p>

                <p><b class="APPLICATION">FIPS</b> does NOT
                currently work with FAT32 or VFAT style partitions
                as used by newer versions of Windows 95. To split
                up such a partition, you will need a commercial
                product such as <b class="APPLICATION">Partition
                Magic</b>. Sorry, but this is just the breaks if
                you've got a Windows partition hogging your whole
                disk and you don't want to reinstall from
                scratch.</p>

                compressed DOS filesystems from FreeBSD?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>No. If you are using a utility such as <b
                class="APPLICATION">Stacker</b>(tm) or <b class=
                "APPLICATION">DoubleSpace</b>(tm), FreeBSD will
                only be able to use whatever portion of the
                filesystem you leave uncompressed. The rest of the
                filesystem will show up as one large file (the
                stacked/dblspaced file!). <span class="emphasis"><i
                class="EMPHASIS">Do not remove that file</i></span>
                as you will probably regret it greatly!</p>

                <p>It is probably better to create another
                uncompressed DOS extended partition and use this
                for communications between DOS and FreeBSD if such
                is your desire.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>Yes. DOS extended partitions are mapped
                in at the end of the other ``slices'' in FreeBSD,
                e.g. your <tt class="DEVICENAME">D:</tt> drive
                might be <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/da0s5</tt>, your
                <tt class="DEVICENAME">E:</tt> drive <tt class=
                "FILENAME">/dev/da0s6</tt>, and so on. This example
                assumes, of course, that your extended partition is
                on SCSI drive 0. For IDE drives, substitute <tt
                class="LITERAL">ad</tt> for <tt class=
                "LITERAL">da</tt> appropriately. You otherwise
                mount extended partitions exactly like you would
                mount any other DOS drive, e.g.:</p>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="LAYOUT">2 Distribution
        Format</a></h1>

        <p>A typical FreeBSD distribution directory looks something
        like this:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    ERRATA.HTM      README.TXT      compat1x        dict            manpages
    ERRATA.TXT      RELNOTES.HTM    compat20        doc             packages
    HARDWARE.HTM    RELNOTES.TXT    compat21        docbook.css     ports
    HARDWARE.TXT    XF86336         compat22        floppies        proflibs
    INSTALL.HTM     bin             compat3x        games           src
    INSTALL.TXT     catpages        compat4x        info            tools
    README.HTM      cdrom.inf       crypto          kernel
</pre>

        <p>If you want to do a CDROM, FTP or NFS installation from
        this distribution directory, all you need to do is make the
        1.44MB boot floppies from the floppies directory (see <a
        href="#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a> for instructions on how to
        do this), boot them and follow the instructions. The rest
        of the data needed during the installation will be obtained
        automatically based on your selections. If you've never
        installed FreeBSD before, you also want to read the
        entirety of this document (the installation instructions)
        file.</p>

        <p>If you're trying to do some other type of installation
        or are merely curious about how a distribution is
        organized, what follows is a more thorough description of
        each item in more detail:</p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">*.TXT</tt> and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">*.HTM</tt> files contain documentation (for
            example, this document is contained in both <tt class=
            "FILENAME">INSTALL.TXT</tt> and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">INSTALL.HTM</tt>) and should be read before
            starting an installation. The <tt class=
            "FILENAME">*.TXT</tt> files are plain text, while the
            <tt class="FILENAME">*.HTM</tt> files are HTML files
            that can be read by almost any Web browser. Some
            distributions may contain documentation in other
            formats as well, such as PDF or PostScript.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><tt class="FILENAME">docbook.css</tt> is a Cascading
            Style Sheet (CSS) file used by some Web browsers for
            formatting the HTML documentation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">XF86336</tt> directory
            contains the XFree86 project's 3.3.6 release and
            consists of a series of gzip'd tar files which contain
            each component of the XFree86 distribution.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">bin</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">catpages</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">crypto</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">dict</tt>,
            <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">games</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">info</tt>,
            <tt class="FILENAME">manpages</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">proflibs</tt>, and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">src</tt> directories contain the primary
            distribution components of FreeBSD itself and are split
            into smaller files for easy packing onto floppies
            (should that be necessary).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">compat1x</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat20</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat21</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat22</tt>, <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat3x</tt>, and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">compat4x</tt> directories contain
            distributions for compatibility with older releases and
            are distributed as single gzip'd tar files - they can
            be installed during release time or later by running
            their <tt class="FILENAME">install.sh</tt> scripts.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">floppies/</tt> subdirectory
            contains the floppy installation images; further
            information on using them can be found in <a href=
            "#FLOPPIES">Section 1.3</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">packages</tt> and <tt
            class="FILENAME">ports</tt> directories contain the
            FreeBSD Packages and Ports Collections. Packages may be
            installed from the packages directory by running the
            command:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt><tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>/stand/sysinstall configPackages</b></tt>
</pre>

            <p>Packages can also be installed by feeding individual
            filenames in <tt class="FILENAME">packages</tt>/ to the
            <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">pkg_add</span>(1)</span></a>
            command.</p>

            <p>The Ports Collection may be installed like any other
            distribution and requires about 100MB unpacked. More
            information on the ports collection may be obtained
            from <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/" target=
            "_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/</a> or locally
            from <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/share/doc/handbook</tt>
            if you've installed the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
            distribution.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Last of all, the <tt class="FILENAME">tools</tt>
            directory contains various DOS tools for discovering
            disk geometries, installing boot managers and the like.
            It is purely optional and provided only for user
            convenience.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>A typical distribution directory (for example, the <tt
        class="FILENAME">info</tt> distribution) looks like this
        internally:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    CHECKSUM.MD5    info.ab         info.ad         info.inf        install.sh
    info.aa         info.ac         info.ae         info.mtree
</pre>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">CHECKSUM.MD5</tt> file contains
        MD5 signatures for each file, should data corruption be
        suspected, and is purely for reference. It is not used by
        the actual installation and does not need to be copied with
        the rest of the distribution files. The <tt class=
        "FILENAME">info.a*</tt> files are split, gzip'd tar files,
        the contents of which can be viewed by doing:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="PROMPT">#</tt> <tt class=
"USERINPUT"><b>cat info.a* | tar tvzf -</b></tt>

        <p>During installation, they are automatically concatenated
        and extracted by the installation procedure.</p>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">info.inf</tt> file is also
        necessary since it is read by the installation program in
        order to figure out how many pieces to look for when
        fetching and concatenating the distribution. When putting
        distributions onto floppies, the <tt class=
        "FILENAME">.inf</tt> file <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">must</i></span> occupy the first floppy of each
        distribution set!</p>

        <p>The <tt class="FILENAME">info.mtree</tt> file is another
        non-essential file which is provided for user reference. It
        contains the MD5 signatures of the <span class=
        "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">unpacked</i></span>
        distribution files and can be later used with the <a href=

        <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=

        verify the installation permissions and checksums against
        any possible modifications to the file. When used with the
        <tt class="FILENAME">bin</tt> distribution, this can be an
        excellent way of detecting trojan horse attacks on your
        system.</p>

        <p>Finally, the <tt class="FILENAME">install.sh</tt> file
        is for use by those who want to install the distribution
        after installation time. To install the info distribution
        from CDROM after a system was installed, for example, you'd
        do:</p>

          <p>FreeBSD features a ``Fixit'' option in the top menu of

          <tt class="FILENAME">fixit.flp</tt> image floppy,

          ``live filesystem'' CDROM; typically the second CDROM in

          <p>To invoke fixit, simply boot the <tt class=

          item and insert the fixit floppy or CDROM when asked. You

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>There is a longstanding problem in the
                case where the boot disk is not the first disk in
                the system. The BIOS uses a different numbering
                scheme to FreeBSD, and working out which numbers
                correspond to which is difficult to get right.</p>

                <p>In the case where the boot disk is not the first
                disk in the system, FreeBSD can need some help
                finding it. There are two common situations here,
                and in both of these cases, you need to tell
                FreeBSD where the root filesystem is. You do this
                by specifying the BIOS disk number, the disk type
                and the FreeBSD disk number for that type.</p>

                <p>The first situation is where you have two IDE
                disks, each configured as the master on their
                respective IDE busses, and wish to boot FreeBSD
                from the second disk. The BIOS sees these as disk 0
                and disk 1, while FreeBSD sees them as <tt class=
                "DEVICENAME">wd0</tt> and <tt class=
                "DEVICENAME">wd2</tt>.</p>

                <p>FreeBSD is on BIOS disk 1, of type <tt class=
                "LITERAL">wd</tt> and the FreeBSD disk number is 2,
                so you would say:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    <tt class="USERINPUT"><b>1:wd(2,a)kernel</b></tt>
</pre>

                <p>Note that if you have a slave on the primary
                bus, the above is not necessary (and is effectively
                wrong).</p>

                <p>The second situation involves booting from a
                SCSI disk when you have one or more IDE disks in
                the system. In this case, the FreeBSD disk number
                is lower than the BIOS disk number. If you have two
                IDE disks as well as the SCSI disk, the SCSI disk
                is BIOS disk 2, type <tt class="LITERAL">da</tt>
                and FreeBSD disk number 0, so you would say:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">

                <p>To tell FreeBSD that you want to boot from BIOS
                disk 2, which is the first SCSI disk in the system.
                If you only had one IDE disk, you would use '1:'
                instead.</p>

                <p>Once you have determined the correct values to
                use, you can put the command exactly as you would
                have typed it in the <tt class=
                "FILENAME">/boot.config</tt> file using a standard
                text editor. Unless instructed otherwise, FreeBSD
                will use the contents of this file as the default
                response to the <tt class="LITERAL">boot:</tt>
                prompt.</p>

                <p><b></b>The hard disk geometry was set
                incorrectly in the Partition editor when you
                installed FreeBSD. Go back into the partition
                editor and specify the actual geometry of your hard
                disk. You must reinstall FreeBSD again from the
                beginning with the correct geometry.</p>

                <p>If you are failing entirely in figuring out the
                correct geometry for your machine, here's a tip:
                Install a small DOS partition at the beginning of
                the disk and install FreeBSD after that. The
                install program will see the DOS partition and try
                to infer the correct geometry from it, which
                usually works.</p>

                <p>The following tip is no longer recommended, but
                is left here for reference:</p>

                  <p>If you are setting up a truly dedicated

                  care for (future) compatibility with DOS, Linux
                  or another operating system, you've also got the
                  option to use the entire disk (`A' in the
                  partition editor), selecting the non-standard
                  option where FreeBSD occupies the entire disk
                  from the very first to the very last sector. This
                  will leave all geometry considerations aside, but
                  is somewhat limiting unless you're never going to

                <p><a name="Q4.3.2."></a><b>4.3.2.</b> FreeBSD
                claims to support the 3Com PCMCIA card, but my card
                isn't recognized when it's plugged into my
                laptop.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>There are a couple of possible problems.
                First of all, FreeBSD does not support
                multi-function cards, so if you have a combo
                Ethernet/modem card (such as the 3C562), it won't
                work. The default driver for the 3C589 card was
                written just like all of the other drivers in
                FreeBSD, and depend on the card's own configuration
                data stored in NVRAM to work. You must correctly
                configure FreeBSD's driver to match the IRQ, port,
                and IOMEM stored in NVRAM.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the only program capable of
                reading them is the 3COM supplied DOS program. This
                program must be run on a absolutely clean system
                (no other drivers must be running), and the program
                will whine about CARD-Services not being found, but
                it will continue. This is necessary to read the
                NVRAM values. You want to know the IRQ, port, and
                IOMEM values (the latter is called the CIS tuple by
                3COM). The first two can be set in the program, the
                third is un-settable, and can only be read. Once
                you have these values, set them in UserConfig and
                your card will be recognized.</p>

              <div class="ANSWER">
                <p><b></b>Many PCMCIA cards have the ability to use
                either the 10-Base2 (BNC) or 10-BaseT connectors
                for connecting to the network. The driver is unable
                to ``auto-select'' the correct connector, so you
                must tell it which connector to use. In order to
                switch between the two connectors, the link flags
                must be set. Depending on the model of the card,
                <tt class="OPTION">-link0 link1</tt> or <tt class=

                <p><b></b>Your card is probably on a different IRQ
                from what is specified in the kernel configuration.
                The ed driver does not use the `soft' configuration
                by default (values entered using EZSETUP in DOS),
                but it will use the software configuration if you
                specify <tt class="LITERAL">?</tt> in the IRQ field
                of your kernel config file.</p>

                <p>Either move the jumper on the card to a hard
                configuration setting (altering the kernel settings
                if necessary), or specify the IRQ as <tt class=
                "LITERAL">-1</tt> in UserConfig or <tt class=
                "LITERAL">?</tt> in your kernel config file. This
                will tell the kernel to use the soft
                configuration.</p>

                <p>Another possibility is that your card is at IRQ
                9, which is shared by IRQ 2 and frequently a cause
                of problems (especially when you have a VGA card
                using IRQ 2!). You should not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at

                you have. (Some SoundBlaster DOS drivers report a
                hardware I/O port address for the CD-ROM interface
                that is 0x10 lower than it really is.)</p>

                <p>If you are unable to determine the settings for
                the card by examining the board or documentation,
                you can use UserConfig to change the 'port' address
                (I/O port) to -1 and start the system. This setting
                causes the driver to look at a number of I/O ports
                that various manufacturers use for their
                Matsushita/Panasonic/Creative CD-ROM interfaces.
                Once the driver locates the address, you should run
                UserConfig again and specify the correct address.
                Leaving the 'port' parameter set to -1 increases
                the amount of time that it takes the system to
                boot, and this could interfere with other

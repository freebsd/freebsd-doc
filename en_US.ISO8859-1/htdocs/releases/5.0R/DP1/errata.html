          <li>
            <p>LOMAC doesn't protect against a certain class of
            inter-process activities such as signaling, since the
            MAC hooks those checks rely on aren't in the base tree
            yet.</p>

          <li>
            <p>The system documentation indicates that there is
            support for POSIX.1e capabilities, but the kernel
            infrastructure is not merged; the documentation and
            library may be removed before 5.0 depending on strategy
            decisions not yet made.</p>

        Features</a></h1>

        <p>A number of very significant changes to the system will
        be made for FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE. These features, and their
        approximate status, are noted here.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The lock-pushdown for fine-grained kernel threading
            is in-process, and not complete in this snapshot. As a
            result, the full benefits are not yet realized.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Scheduler activation support exists only in the
            kernel, not in the userland thread library, and in this
            snapshot, threads from the same process using KSE can
            execute on only one processor at a time.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Mandatory access control support from the TrustedBSD
            branch is not yet merged.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>UFS2 (essentially, UFS with extended attributes in
            inodes) is not yet ready for inclusion in the
            snapshot.</p>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN65">3 Known Pitfalls</a></h1>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>FreeBSD 5.0-DP1 has a number of debugging features
            enabled. These generally have a negative impact on
            performance. One notable example is that the user-level
            <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=malloc&sektion=3&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">malloc</span>(3)</span></a> functions
            behave, by default, as though the <tt class=
            "LITERAL">AJ</tt> debugging flags were set. Those
            benchmarking the system should be sure to run without
            debugging features enabled.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Interrupt latency is high due to on-going SMP work,
            this will be fixed prior to the final release.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Tighter enforcement of <tt class=
            "LITERAL">#include</tt> file deprecation results in a
            number of common applications failing to build. In
            particular, if you <tt class="LITERAL">#include
            &lt;malloc.h&#62;</tt>, you now get a <tt class=
            "LITERAL">#error</tt> instead of a <tt class=
            "LITERAL">#warning</tt>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The kernel is no longer installed as <tt class=
            "FILENAME">/kernel</tt> and <tt class=
            "FILENAME">/modules</tt>, these have moved to <tt
            class="FILENAME">/boot/kernel</tt>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When upgrading a system, make sure to pay attention
            to the change from an <tt class=
            "FILENAME">/etc/pam.conf</tt> configure file to
            multiple files in <tt class=
            "FILENAME">/etc/pam.d/</tt>. Likewise, <b class=
            "APPLICATION">OpenPAM</b> has replaced <b class=
            "APPLICATION">LinuxPAM</b>, and new PAM modules have
            been introduced; this may result in warnings from older
            authentication-related applications compiled under <tt
            class="LITERAL">RELENG_4</tt>, such as <b class=
            "APPLICATION">xdm</b>, <b class="APPLICATION">kdm</b>,
            and <b class="APPLICATION">gdm</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The <b class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b> startup code
            in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/rc</tt> has been changed
            to support the new requirements of <b class=
            "APPLICATION">sendmail</b> 8.12. The new setup may
            cause problems for users running MTAs other than <b
            class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b>. You can prevent any
            <b class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b> daemons from
            starting at boot time by adding the following to <tt
            class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt>:</p>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
    sendmail_enable="NO"
    sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
    sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
    sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
</pre>

            <p>Note that 5.0-DP2 (as well as 5.0-RELEASE) will
            support a <tt class=
            "LITERAL">sendmail_enable="NONE"</tt> setting to
            disable all <b class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b> daemons
            with a single variable. This functionality was <span
            class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span>
            merged to the 5.0-DP1 snapshot.</p>
          </li>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN110">4 Testing Guide</a></h1>

        <p>While testing reports of all aspects of FreeBSD 5.0-DP1
        are welcomed, there are several areas which could benefit
        from some extra testing:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Basic kernel functionality. The changes for SMPng
            are still in progress, and have some far-reaching
            effects throughout many parts of the kernel. Testing
            the kernel's stability on both UP and SMP machines will
            help find any regressions that may have come about.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The PAM infrastructure has undergone significant
            changes, including a replacement of <b class=
            "APPLICATION">Linux PAM</b> with <b class=
            "APPLICATION">OpenPAM</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>FFS snapshots and background <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">fsck</span>(8)</span></a>. The latter
            feature is enabled by default; a reasonable test for
            snapshots is to do backups by creating a snapshot using
            the instructions in <tt class=
            "FILENAME">src/sys/ufs/ffs/README.snapshot</tt> and
            performing a <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dump&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">dump</span>(8)</span></a> of the
            snapshot.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Because of API changes, a number of ports in the
            FreeBSD Ports Collection are broken under FreeBSD
            5-CURRENT. Frequently, there are straightforward fixes
            for these ports; submitting these fixes will improve
            the state of buildable ports and packages that can be
            shipped with FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>NFS has undergone some significant code
            reorganization, although it is believed to be fairly
            stable. NFS client locking is a new feature.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The sparc64 platform support is new, and could use
            testing on a wider variety of hardware.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><b class="APPLICATION">XFree86</b> 4.2.0 was
            recently made the default version of XFree86 installed
            by <a href=
            "http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current">
            <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
            "REFENTRYTITLE">sysinstall</span>(8)</span></a>.
            Testing with as many different video cards as possible
            will help determine if this should be merged to the
            FreeBSD -STABLE branch.</p>

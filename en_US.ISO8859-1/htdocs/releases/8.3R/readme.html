<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="INTRO" name="INTRO">1 Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This distribution is a release of FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE, the latest point along the
8.2-STABLE branch.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN30" name="AEN30">1.1 About FreeBSD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for &#09;AMD64 and Intel EM64T
based PC hardware (amd64), &#09;Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen &#8220;x86&#8221; based PC
hardware (i386), &#09;Intel Itanium Processor based computers (ia64), &#09;NEC
PC-9801/9821 series PCs and compatibles (pc98), &#09;and <span
class="TRADEMARK">UltraSPARC</span>&reg; machines (sparc64). Versions &#09;for the <span
class="TRADEMARK">ARM</span>&reg; (arm), <span class="TRADEMARK">MIPS</span>&reg; (mips),
and &#09;<span class="TRADEMARK">PowerPC</span>&reg; (powerpc) architectures are
currently under &#09;development as well. FreeBSD works with a wide variety of
&#09;peripherals and configurations and can be used for everything &#09;from software
development to games to Internet Service &#09;Provision.</p>

<p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run &#09;such a system,
including full source code for the kernel and &#09;all utilities in the base
distribution. With the source &#09;distribution installed, you can literally recompile
the entire &#09;system from scratch with one command, making it ideal for &#09;students,
researchers, or users who simply want to see how it &#09;all works.</p>

<p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the &#09;&#8220;Ports
Collection&#8221;) is also provided to make it &#09;easy to obtain and install all your
favorite traditional <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg; &#09;utilities for FreeBSD.
Each &#8220;port&#8221; consists of a &#09;set of scripts to retrieve, configure, build,
and install a &#09;piece of software, with a single command. Over 23,000 &#09;ports, from
editors to programming languages to graphical &#09;applications, make FreeBSD a powerful
and comprehensive operating &#09;environment that extends far beyond what's provided by
many &#09;commercial versions of <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>. Most ports are also
available as &#09;pre-compiled &#8220;packages&#8221;, which can be quickly
&#09;installed from the installation program.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN45" name="AEN45">1.2 Target Audience</a></h3>

<p>This release of FreeBSD is suitable for all users. It &#09;has undergone a period of
testing and quality assurance &#09;checking to ensure the highest reliability and
&#09;dependability.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT1">
<hr />
<h2 class="SECT1"><a id="OBTAIN" name="OBTAIN">2 Obtaining FreeBSD</a></h2>

<p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This section focuses on those ways that
are primarily useful for obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating
an existing installation.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN51" name="AEN51">2.1 CDROM and DVD</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM or DVD &#09;from several
publishers. This is frequently the most &#09;convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new
installations, as it &#09;provides a convenient way to quickly reinstall the system if
&#09;necessary. Some distributions include some of the optional, &#09;precompiled
&#8220;packages&#8221; from the FreeBSD Ports &#09;Collection, or other extra
material.</p>

<p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the &#09;project are listed in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"
target="_top">&#8220;Obtaining &#09;FreeBSD&#8221;</a> appendix to the Handbook.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN58" name="AEN58">2.2 FTP</a></h3>

<p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of its &#09;optional packages from
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the
official &#09;FreeBSD release site, or any of its &#09;&#8220;mirrors&#8221;.</p>

<p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in the &#09;<a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
target="_top">FTP &#09;Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or on the <a
href="http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/" target="_top">http://mirrorlist.FreeBSD.org/</a>
Web pages. &#09;Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which to &#09;download
the distribution is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact &#09;<code class="EMAIL">&#60;<a
href="mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&#62;</code> for
more details on &#09;becoming an official mirror site. You can also find useful
information for mirror sites at the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/hubs/" target="_top">Mirroring
FreeBSD</a> article.</p>

<p>Mirrors generally contain the ISO images generally used to &#09;create a CDROM of a
FreeBSD release. They usually also contain &#09;floppy disk images (for applicable
platforms), as well as the &#09;files necessary to do an installation over the network.
&#09;Finally mirrors sites usually contain a set of packages for &#09;the most current
release.</p>

Project</a></h2>

<div class="SECT2">
<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN72" name="AEN72">3.1 Email and Mailing Lists</a></h3>

<p>For any questions or general technical support issues, &#09;please send mail to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD
general questions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>If you're tracking the 8.2-STABLE development efforts, you &#09;<span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> join the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a>, in order to &#09;keep abreast of recent
developments and changes that may &#09;affect the way you use and maintain the
system.</p>

<p>Being a largely-volunteer effort, the FreeBSD &#09;Project is always happy to have
extra hands willing to help--there are already far more desired enhancements than
&#09;there is time to implement them. To contact the developers on &#09;technical
matters, or with offers of help, please send mail to &#09;the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers" target="_top">FreeBSD
technical discussions mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that these mailing lists can experience &#09;<span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">significant</i></span> amounts of traffic. If you &#09;have slow or
expensive mail access, or are only interested in &#09;keeping up with major FreeBSD
events, you may find it &#09;preferable to subscribe instead to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce" target="_top">FreeBSD
announcements mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone &#09;wishing to do so. Visit
the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo" target="_top">&#09;FreeBSD Mailman
Info Page</a>. This will give you more &#09;information on joining the various lists,
accessing archives, &#09;etc. There are a number of mailing lists targeted at special
&#09;interest groups not mentioned here; more information can be &#09;obtained either
from the Mailman pages or the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#mailing-list"
target="_top">mailing &#09;lists section</a> of the FreeBSD Web site.</p>

<div class="IMPORTANT">
<blockquote class="IMPORTANT">
<p><b>Important:</b> Do <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> send
email to the lists &#09; asking to be subscribed. Use the Mailman interface &#09;
instead.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN90" name="AEN90">3.2 Submitting Problem Reports</a></h3>

<p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are &#09;always valued--please do
not hesitate to report any &#09;problems you may find. Bug reports with attached fixes
are of &#09;course even more welcome.</p>

<p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine &#09;with Internet mail
connectivity is to use the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.3-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
&#09;command. &#09;&#8220;Problem Reports&#8221; (PRs) submitted in this way &#09;will be
filed and their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers &#09;will do their best to
respond to all reported bugs as soon as &#09;possible. <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi" target="_top">A list &#09;of all
active PRs</a> is available on the FreeBSD Web site; &#09;this list is useful to see what
potential problems other users &#09;have encountered.</p>

<p>Note that <a

<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>
itself is a shell script that &#09;should be easy to move even onto a non-FreeBSD system.
Using &#09;this interface is highly preferred. If, for some reason, you &#09;are unable
to use <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.3-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a> to
submit a bug report, you &#09;can try to send it to the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-bugs" target="_top">FreeBSD
problem reports mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN144" name="AEN144">4.2 Manual Pages</a></h3>

<p>As with almost all <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> like operating systems, FreeBSD
comes &#09;with a set of on-line manual pages, accessed through the &#09;<a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+8.3-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">man</span>(1)</span></a> command
or through the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi" target="_top">hypertext
manual &#09;pages gateway</a> on the FreeBSD Web site. In general, the &#09;manual pages
provide information on the different commands and &#09;APIs available to the FreeBSD
user.</p>

<p>In some cases, manual pages are written to give &#09;information on particular topics.
Notable examples of such &#09;manual pages are <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+8.3-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tuning</span>(7)</span></a> (a

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN162" name="AEN162">4.3 Books and Articles</a></h3>

<p>Two highly-useful collections of FreeBSD-related information, &#09;maintained by the
FreeBSD Project, &#09;are the FreeBSD Handbook and FreeBSD FAQ (Frequently Asked
&#09;Questions document). On-line versions of the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
target="_top">Handbook</a> &#09;and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/" target="_top">FAQ</a>
&#09;are always available from the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/docs.html"
target="_top">FreeBSD Documentation &#09;page</a> or its mirrors. If you install the
&#09;<tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt> distribution set, you can use a Web &#09;browser to
read the Handbook and FAQ locally. In particular, &#09;note that the Handbook contains a
step-by-step guide to &#09;installing FreeBSD.</p>

<p>A number of on-line books and articles, also maintained by the FreeBSD Project, cover
more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics. This material spans a wide range of topics,
from effective use of the mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other operating
systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like the Handbook and FAQ, these documents are
available from the FreeBSD Documentation Page or in the <tt class="FILENAME">doc</tt>
distribution set.</p>

<p>A listing of other books and documents about FreeBSD can be found in the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html"
target="_top">bibliography</a> of the FreeBSD Handbook. Because of FreeBSD's strong <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> heritage, many other articles and books written for <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> systems are applicable as well, some of which are also
listed in the bibliography.</p>

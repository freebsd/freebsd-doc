  <b>From:</b> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@freebsd.org&gt;<br>
  <b>To:</b> announce@FreeBSD.org<br>
  <b>Subject:</b> 4.3-RELEASE is now available</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce what is probably the
finest release produced from the 4.x-STABLE branch to date,
FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE.  Following the release of FreeBSD 4.2
in November, 2000, many bugs were fixed, important security issues
dealt with, and a reasonable number of new features added.
Please see the release notes for more information.</p>

<p>4.3-RELEASE is available for the
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.3-RELEASE">i386</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.3-RELEASE">alpha</a>
architectures and can be installed directly over the net using
the boot floppies or copied to a local NFS/ftp server.</p>

ISO (CD) Images<br>
---------------<br>
<p>We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the larger
ISO images, but they will at least be available from:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.3-install.iso">
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.3-install.iso</a><br> and
<a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.3-install.iso">
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.3-install.iso</a></p>

<p>If you can't afford the CDs, are impatient, or just want to use it for
evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISOs, otherwise please
do continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing one of its
official CD releases from BSDi.  FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE can be ordered as a
4 CD set from <a href="http://www.freebsdmall.com">The FreeBSD Mall</a>
from where it will soon be shipping.  Each CD sets contains the FreeBSD
installation and application package bits for either the x86 or the
alpha architecture (each architecture has its own CD set).  For a set of
distfiles used to build ports in the ports collection, please see also the
FreeBSD Toolkit, a 6 CD set containing all such extra bits which we can no
longer fit on the 4 CD sets.  You can also order by phone, postal mail,
FAX or email at:</p>

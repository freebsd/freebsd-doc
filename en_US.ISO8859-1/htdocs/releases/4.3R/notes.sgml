1. What's new since 4.2-RELEASE
-------------------------------

1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

Write combining for crashdumps has been implemented.  This feature
is useful when write caching is disabled on both SCSI and IDE disks,
where large memory dumps could take up to an hour to complete.

The pccard driver and pccardc(8) now support multiple "beep types"
upon card insertion and removal.

The twe(4) driver for 3Ware Escalade controllers has been updated.

The an(4) driver for Cisco Aironet cards now supports Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP) encryption, settable via ancontrol(8).

The wi(4) and an(4) drivers now default to BSS (infrastructure) mode;
previously the default was ad-hoc mode.

The ray(4) driver, which supports the Webgear Aviator wireless network
cards, has been committed.  The operation of ray(4) interfaces can be
modified by raycontrol(8).

Support for the Adaptec FSA family of PCI-SCSI RAID controllers has
been added, in the form of the aac(4) driver.

Linksys Fast Ethernet PCCARD cards supported by the ed(4) driver now
require the addition of flag 0x80000 to their config line in
pccard.conf(5).  This flag is not optional.  These Linksys cards will
not be recognized without it.

A bug in the ed(4) driver that could cause panics with very short
packets and BPF or bridging active has been fixed.

A bug in FFS that could cause superblock corruption on very large
filesystems has been corrected.

The ISO-9660 filesystem now has a hook that supports a loadable
character conversion routine.  The sysutils/cd9660_unicode port
contains a set of common conversions.

A new NFS hash function (based on the Fowler/Noll/Vo hash algorithm)
has been implemented to improve NFS performance by increasing the
efficiency of the nfsnode hash tables.

The cs(4) driver has been updated.

bridge(4) and dummynet(4) have received some enhancements and bug fixes.

The ahc(4) driver has been updated.  Among various improvements are
improved compatibility with chips in "RAID Port" mode and systems with
AAA and ARO cards installed, as well as performance improvements.
Some bugs were also fixed, including a rare hang on Ultra2/U160
controllers.

The cd(4) driver now has support for write operations.  This allows
writing to DVD-RAM, PD and similar drives that probe as CD devices.
Note that this change affects only random-access writeable devices, not
sequential-only writeable devices such as CD-R drives, which are
supported by cdrecord(1).

The "make buildkernel" procedure has changed slightly.  It now gets
the name of the configuration(s) to build from the KERNCONF variable
(KERNEL is still valid, but deprecated).  The installed kernel name
can be changed with the INSTKERNEL variable.  The NO_KERNELCLEAN
variable prevents cleaning of the kernel build directory (which is now
done via "make clean", rather than "config -r").

kobj functionality has been merged from -CURRENT to better support
sound drivers.

Separate drivers for the SoundBlaster 8 and Soundblaster 16 now
replace an older, unified driver.

A driver for the ESS Maestro-3/Allegro has been added, however due to
licensing restrictions, it cannot be compiled into the kernel.  To use
this driver, add the following line to /boot/loader.conf:

	snd_maestro3_load="YES"

The pcm(4) driver now supports the CMedia CMI8338/CMI8738 sound chips,
as well as the CS4281 sound chip.

When sound modules are built, one can now load all the drivers and
infrastructure by "kldload snd".

The isp(4) driver has been updated.

ipfilter has been updated to 3.4.16.

ipfw(8) has a new feature ("me") that allows for packet matching on
interfaces with dynamically-changing IP addresses.

TCP has received some bug fixes for its delayed ACK behavior.

TCP now supports the NewReno modification to the TCP Fast Recovery
algorithm.  This behavior can be controlled via the
net.inet.tcp.newreno sysctl variable.

TCP now uses a more aggressive timeout for initial SYN segments; this
allows initial connection attempts to be dropped much faster.

ICMP UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB messages can now RST TCP connections in the
SYN_SENT state if the correct sequence numbers are sent back, as
controlled by the net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst sysctl.

A new sysctl net.inet.ip.check_interface, which is off by default,
causes IP to verify that an incoming packet arrives on an interface
that has an address matching the packet's destination address.

The ata(4) driver has been updated.

To provide more flexible configuration, the various options for the
ata(4) driver are now boot loader tunables, rather than kernel
configure-time options.

The ata(4) driver now supports ATA66 and ATA100 mode on Acer Alladin
chipsets.

kqueue(2) has been extended to the device layer, and has also received
some bug fixes.

Some signal-handling fixes for Linux have been added, which improves
compatibility with signal-intensive programs running under Linux
emulation.

The ida disk driver now has crashdump support.

The mly(4) driver has received some changes in queueing, concurrency
improvements, and stability fixes.

Several minor bugs have been fixed in the VLAN networking code.

Vinum has received some bugfixes.

Changes specific to Alpha architecture:

   A bug in the machine-dependent code for the AlphaServer 1000 and 1000A
   has been fixed; it had caused only EV4-equipped AS1000 and EV5-equipped
   AS1000A systems to work.

   The API UP1100 mainboard has been verified to work correctly.

   The API CS20 1U high server has been verified to work correctly.

   AlphaServer 2100A ("Lynx") support has been added.

   The AlphaServer 4000 and 4100 refuse to boot from the FreeBSD install
   floppy or install CDROM.  The workaround is to "dd" the 2.88MB floppy image
   onto a hard disk and boot the installer from it. Once sysinstall(8) is
   running, a normal installation can be performed. Similar problems have
   been observed on the AlphaServer 1200 and 8400.

   For AlphaServer 4100 adapter cards with PCI bridge chips might cause
   trouble. In addition, the capability of booting from an adapter might be
   influenced by the placement of the adapter card on a specific PCI hose.
   Please use 'send-pr' to report any problems you might encounter in this area.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

Some fixes were applied to the Kerberos IV implementation related to
environment variables, a possible buffer overrun, and overwriting
ticket files.

telnet(1) now does a better job of sanitizing its environment.

Several vulnerabilities in procfs(4) were fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:77).

A bug in ipfw(8) and ip6fw(8) in which inbound TCP segments could
incorrectly be treated as being part of an "established" connection
has been fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:08).

A bug in crontab(8) that could allow users to read any file on the
system in valid crontab(5) syntax has been fixed (see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:09).

A vulnerability in inetd(8) that could allow read-access to the
initial 16 bytes of wheel-accessible files has been fixed (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:11).

A bug in periodic(8) that used insecure temporary files has been
corrected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:12).

To fix a remotely-exploitable buffer overflow, BIND has been updated
to 8.2.3 (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:18).

OpenSSH now has code to prevent (instead of just mitigating through
connection limits) an attack that can lead to guessing the server key
(not host key) by regenerating the server key when an RSA failure is
detected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:24).

A bug in ICMP that could cause an attacker to disrupt TCP and UDP
"sessions" has been corrected.

A bug in timed(8), which caused it to crash if sent certain malformed
packets, has been corrected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:28).

A bug in rwhod(8), which caused it to crash if sent certain malformed
packets, has been corrected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:29).

A security hole in FreeBSD's FFS and EXT2FS implementations, which
allowed a race condition that could cause users to have unauthorized
access to data, has been fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:30).

A remotely-exploitable vulnerability in ntpd(8) has been closed (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:31).

A security hole in IPFilter's fragment cache has been closed (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:32).

Buffer overflows in glob(3), which could cause arbitrary code to be
run on an FTP server, have been closed.  In addition, to prevent some
forms of DOS attacks, glob(3) now allows specification of a limit on
the number of pathname matches it will return.  ftpd(8) now uses this
feature (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:33).

Initial sequence numbers in TCP are more thoroughly randomized, using
an algorithm obtained from OpenBSD.

A number of programs have had output formatting strings corrected so
as to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.

A number of programs that use temporary files now do so more securely.


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

newfs(1) now implements write combining, which can make creation of
new filesystems up to seven times faster.

A number of buffer overflows in config(8) have been fixed.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.1.

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.6.

OpenSSL now has support for machine-dependent ASM optimizations,
activated by the new CPUTYPE/MACHINE_CPU Makefile variables.

file(1) has been contribify-ed, and imported as version 3.33.

groff(1) and its related utilities have been updated to FSF version
1.16.1.

indent(1) has gained some new formatting options.

sysinstall(8) now uses some more intuitive defaults thanks to some new
dialog support functions.

sysinstall(8) now properly preserves /etc/mail during a binary
upgrade.

The default root partition in sysinstall(8) is now 100MB.

libdisk can now do install-time configuration of the i386 boot0 boot
loader.

rm(1) -v now displays the entire pathname of a file being
removed.

lpr(1), lpq(1), and lpd(8) have received a few minor enhancements.

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.3.0.  This version adds support for the
Rijndael encryption algorithm.

Kerberos compatability has been added to OpenSSH.

OpenSSH has been modified to be more resistant to traffic analysis by
requiring that "non-echoed" characters are still echoed back in a null
packet, as well as by padding passwords sent so as not to hint at
password lengths.

syslogd(8) now supports a "LOG_CONSOLE" facility (disabled by
default), which can be used to log /dev/console output.

cdcontrol(1) now uses the CDROM environment variable to pick a default
device.

All packages and ports now contain an "origin" directive, which makes
it easier for programs like pkg_version(1) to determine the directory
from which a package was built.

pkg_info(1) can now accept a -g flag for verifying an installed
package against its recorded checksums (to see if it's been modified
post-installation).  Naturally, this mechanism is only as secure as
the contents of /var/db/pkg if it's to be used for auditing
purposes.

pkg_create(1) and pkg_add(1) can now work with packages that have
been compressed using bzip2(1).  pkg_add(1) will use the
PACKAGEROOT environment variable to determine a mirror site for new
packages.

pkg_info(1) now supports globbing against names of installed packages.
The -G option disables this behavior, and the -x option causes regular
expression matching instead of shell globbing.

pkg_sign(1) and pkg_check(1) have been added to digitally sign and
verify the signatures on binary package files.

pkg_update(1), a utility to update installed packages and update their
dependencies, has been added.

pkg_delete(1) now can perform glob/regexp matching of package names.
In addition, it supports the -a option for removing all packages and
the -i option for rm(1)-style interactive confirmation.

pkg_create(1) now records dependencies in dependency order rather than
in the order specified on the command line.  This improves the
functioning of "pkg_add -r".

pkg_version(1) now has a version number comparison routine that
corresponds to the Porters Handbook.  It also has a -t option for
testing address comparisons.

awk has been upgraded from gawk-3.0.4 to gawk-3.0.6.  This fixes a number
of non-critical bugs and includes a few performance tweaks.

Shortly after the receipt of a SIGINFO signal (normally control-T from
the controlling tty), fsck(8) will now output a line indicating the
current phase number and progress information relevant to the current
phase.

pwd(1) can now double as realpath(1), a program to resolve pathnames
to their underlying physical paths.

gcc(1) has been updated to 2.95.3.

gcc(1) now uses a unified libgcc rather than a separate one for threaded
and non-threaded programs.  /usr/lib/libgcc_r.a can be removed.

config(8) is now better about converting various warnings that should
have been errors into actual fatal errors with an exit code.  This
ensures that that "make buildkernel" doesn't quietly ignore them and
build a bogus kernel without a human to read the errors.

In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, the ConnectionsPerPeriod parameter has been
deprecated in favor of MaxStartups.

find(1) now takes the -empty flag, which returns true if a file or
directory is empty.

find(1) now takes the -iname and -ipath primaries for case-insensitive
matches, and the -regexp and -iregexp primaries for regular-expression
matches.  The -E flag now enables extended regular expressions.

ldconfig(8) now checks directory ownerships and permissions for
greater security; these checks can be disabled with the -i
flag.

sendmail(8) and associated utilities upgraded from version 8.11.1 to
version 8.11.3.  See /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more
information.

New make.conf options: SENDMAIL_MC and SENDMAIL_ADDITIONAL_MC.  See
/etc/defaults/make.conf for more information.

The Makefile in /etc/mail now supports: the new SENDMAIL_MC make.conf
option; the ability to build .cf files from .mc files; generalized map
rebuilding; rebuilding the aliases file; and the ability to stop, start,
and restart sendmail.

vidcontrol(1) now accepts a -g parameter to select custom text
geometry in the VESA_800x600 raster text mode.

The rfork_thread(3) library call has been added as a helper function
to rfork(2).  Using this function should avoid the need to implement
complex stack swap code.

The compat3x distribution has been updated to include libraries
present in FreeBSD 3.5.1-RELEASE.

gperf has been updated to 2.7.2.

Catching up with most other network utilities in the base system,
lpr(1), lpd(8), syslogd(8), and logger(1) are now all IPv6-capable.

When requested to delete multiple packages, pkg_delete(1) will now
attempt to remove them in dependency order rather than the order
specified on the command line.

burncd(8) now supports a -m option for multisession mode (the default
behavior now is to close disks as single-session).  A -l option to
take a list of image files from a filename was also added; "-" can be
used as a filename for stdin.

tar(1) now supports the TAR_RSH variable, principally to enable the
use of ssh(1) as a transport.

Bugs in make(1), among which include broken null suffix behavior, bad
assumptions about current directory permissions, and potential buffer
overflows, have been fixed.

The new CPUTYPE make.conf variable controls the compilation of
processor-specific optimizations in various pieces of code such as
OpenSSL.

Boot-time syscons configuration was moved to a machine-independent
rc.syscons.

login(1) now exports environment variables set by PAM modules.

ipfstat(8) now supports the -t option to turn on a top(1)-like
display.

tftpd(8) now takes the -c and -C options, which allow the server to
chroot(2) based on the IP address of the connecting client.  tftp(1)
and tftpd(8) can now transfer files larger than 65535 blocks.

The lastlogin(1) utility, which prints the last login time of each
user, has been imported from NetBSD.

/usr/src/share/examples/BSD_daemon/ now contains a scalable Beastie
graphic.

bc has been updated from 1.04 to 1.06.

savecore(8) now supports a -k option to prevent clearing a crash dump
after saving it.  It also attempts to avoid writing large stretches of
zeros to crash dump files to save space and time.

tcsh has been updated to version 6.10.

The default value for the CVS_RSH variable (used by cvs(1)) is now
ssh, rather than rsh.

disklabel(8) now supports partition sizes expressed in kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes, in addition to sectors.

Kerberos IV has been updated to 1.0.5.

Heimdal has been updated to 0.3e.

dump(8) now supports inheritance of the "nodump" flag down a
hierarchy.

The ISC DHCP client has been updated to 2.0pl5.

stty(1) now has support for an "erase2" control character, so that
both "delete" and "backspace" can be used to erase characters.

split(1) now has the ability to split a file longer than 2GB.

units(1) has received some updates and bugfixes.

netstat(1) now keeps track of input and output packets on a
per-address basis for each interface.

netstat(1) now has a -W flag that tells it not to truncate addresses,
even if they're too long for the column they're printed in.

sockstat(1) now has -c and -l flags for listing connected and
listening sockets, respectively.

Many manual pages were improved, both in terms of their formatting
markup and in their content.

"lprm -" now works for remote printer queues.

mergemaster(8) now sources an /etc/mergemaster.rc file and also
prompts the user to run recommended commands (such as "newaliases") as
needed.

ftpd(8) now supports a -r flag for read-only mode and a -E flag to
disable EPSV.  It also has some fixes to reduce information leakage
and the ability to specify compile-time port ranges.

rc(8) now has an framework for handling dependencies between
rc.conf(5) variables.

The default TCP port range used by libfetch for passive FTP retrievals
has changed; this affects the behavior of fetch(1), which has gained the
-U option to restore the old behavior.

portmap(8) now takes a -h option to indicate the IP addresses to which
it should bind.  This option may be specified multiple times and is
typically necessary for multi-homed hosts.

GNATS has been updated to 3.113.

tail(1) now has the ability to work on files longer than 2GB.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------
FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA, MCA and PCI
bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium class machines (though the
386sx is not recommended).  Support for generic IDE drive
configurations, various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is
also provided.

With all supported SCSI controllers, full support is provided for
SCSI-I & SCSI-II peripherals, including hard disks, optical disks,
tape drives (including DAT and 8mm Exabyte), medium changers, processor
target devices and CDROM drives.  WORM devices that support CDROM commands
are supported for read-only access by the CDROM driver.  WORM/CD-R/CD-RW
writing support is provided by cdrecord, which is in the ports tree.

The following CD-ROM type systems are supported at this time:
(cd)    SCSI interface (also includes ProAudio Spectrum and
        SoundBlaster SCSI)
(matcd) Matsushita/Panasonic (Creative SoundBlaster) proprietary
        interface (562/563 models)
(scd)   Sony proprietary interface (all models)
(acd)   ATAPI IDE interface

The following drivers were supported under the old SCSI subsystem, but are

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        BSDi / Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite D
        Concord CA  94520
        USA
        +1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -stable development efforts, you should
definitely join the -stable mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!

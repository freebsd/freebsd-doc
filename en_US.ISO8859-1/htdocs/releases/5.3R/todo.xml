    <td>&a.jmg;</td>
    <td>There have been reports that specific gigabit ethernet cards
      supported by the if_re driver are experiencing poor performance; a
      patch has been posted that corrects timer and interrupt problems
      with the driver, and is believed to correct the performace problems.
      The patch will be merged to 6.x and 5.x shortly.</td>

    <td>With improved support for threading primitives, support is now
      required to ease debugging of threaded applications.  Ideally,
      this support will work for both libthr and libkse threading
      models.</td>

    <td>Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use
      non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1).
      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security
      risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in
      a post-procfs world.  &a.des; had prototype patches; &a.robert;
      is developing and testing patches now.  Support for system
      call tracing has been added to ptrace().</td>

    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6
      implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel
      indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto
      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,
      this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf
      header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.</td>

      cancellation and interruption events.</td>

    <td>Revised kld build infrastructure</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.peter;</td>
    <td>Kernel modules are currently built independently from a kernel
      configuration, and independently from one another, resulting in
      substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the
      inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel
      objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional
      compilation in the kernel modules.  In order to improve build
      performance and better support options of this sort, the
      KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped.  &a.peter; has
      done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before
      starting on this work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>

    <td>There have been reports that if_de ethernet cds behave poorly when
      running with debug.mpsafenet="1", even though the driver is marked to
      run all portions with the Giant lock.  This suggests a race condition
      specific to this drive, which is currently being debugged.  A patch
      has been committed to the 6.x and 5.x branches, and appears to correct
      the problem.</td>

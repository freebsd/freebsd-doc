---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.2:     None

---- System Update Information:

<strong>o The compat20 and compat21 distributions install themselves into
  /usr/lib/compat.  The compat20/compat21 distributions are a.out libraries,
  thus they should live in /usr/lib/compat/aout to match the
  "ldconfig_paths_aout" configuration in /etc/defaults/rc.conf.</strong>
                                                                              
Fix: cd /usr/lib/compat
     mkdir -p aout
     mv lib*.so.*.* aout

<strong>o /usr/bin/gdb crashes when debugging core files from static programs</strong>

Fix: This was corrected in revision 1.3.2.2 of solib.c. Obtain the fixed
     version via CVSup (see instructions in handbook) or apply <a href="http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/contrib/gdb/gdb/solib.c.diff?r1=1.3.2.1&amp;r2=1.3.2.2">the patch</a>
     from our CVSweb service.

<strong>o While booting the install floppy, user sees the following message 
  and nothing seems to happen, nor can anything be entered from the keyboard:
 
     Keyboard: no</strong>

Fix: Due to a lack of space, full support for old XT/AT (84-key) keyboards 
     is no longer available in the bootblocks.  Some notebook computers may
     also have this type of keyboard and if you are still using this kind of 
     hardware, you will see the above message about no keyboard being found
     when you boot from an installation CD-ROM or floppy.
  
     As soon as you see the message, hit the space bar and you will see
     the following prompt:
  
       >> FreeBSD/i386 BOOT
       Default: x:xx(x,x)/boot/loader 
       boot:
  
     Then enter `-Dh', and things should proceed normally with your keyboard
     type.  This only happens once at initial installation time and will
     not be a problem afterwards.

    <P><B>Date:</B> Mon, 20 Dec 1999 10:45:47 -0800<BR>
      <B>From:</B> "Jordan K. Hubbard" &lt;jkh@freebsd.org&gt;<BR>
      <B>Subject:</B>FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE is now available.</P>
    
    <p>Just in under the wire for the current millenium, I'm happy to announce
      the availability of FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE, the very latest in 3.x-STABLE
      branch technology.  Following the release of FreeBSD 3.3 in Sept, 1999,
      a lot of new features have been added, many bugs were fixed and even
      more important security issues were dealt with.  Please see the
      <a href="notes.html">release notes</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE is available at <a
	href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/">ftp.FreeBSD.org</a> and
      various <a href="../../handbook/mirrors.html">FTP
	mirror sites</a> throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
      <a href="http://www.FreeBSDMall.com/">The FreeBSD Mall</a>, from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set
      containing installation bits for x86 architecture, as well as a lot of
      other material of general interest to programmers and end-users alike
      (3.4-RELEASE for the Alpha architecture is available from the FTP site
      and will also be available on CDROM several weeks after the x86 product
      is released).</p>
    
    <p>NOTE: All of the profits from the sales of this CD set go to support
      the FreeBSD Project!  We are also continuing our new tradition
      (started with 3.3-RELEASE) of making disc #1 from Walnut Creek CDROM's
      official distribution available via anonymous FTP.  This is the most
      important CD of their 4 set, one which will allow users to install the
      base system and all of its most important add-ons from a single ISO 9660
      image.  We are doing this because the ISO image is rapidly becoming the
      preferred format for distributing operating system releases and we're
      certainly not going to go out of our way to make FreeBSD harder to
      "test drive" if providing the standard NFS/FTP network installation
      methods is no longer enough.  This is a fully-bootable ISO 9660 (with
      RockRidge extensions) image and can be written as a raw ISO image
      by most CD creator software.</p>

    <p>We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the rather large
      installation (660MB) image, but it will at least be available from:</p>

    <p><a
	href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/3.4-install.iso">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/3.4-install.iso</a></p>
    
    <p>along with the more traditional 3.4-RELEASE bits.  If you can't
      afford the CDs, are impatient, or just want to use it for evangelism
      purposes, then by all means download the ISO, otherwise please do
      continue to support the FreeBSD project by purchasing one of its
      official CD releases from Walnut Creek CDROM.</p>
      
    <p>The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:</p>

<h1>Open Issues</h1>

<p>This is a list of open issues that need to be resolved for FreeBSD
  &local.rel;.  If you have any updates for this list, please e-mail
  re@FreeBSD.org.</p>

<p>As many of these open issues involve merging bus_dma driver changes
  from -CURRENT, the <a
  href="&base;/projects/busdma/index.html">busdma</a> project page is
  also useful.</p>

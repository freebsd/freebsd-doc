    <td>When unmounting filesystems &a.kris; reports seeing this warning: <tt>/c: unmount pending error: blocks -68512 files 0</tt>.  This dates back at least to 5.3.  It might be associated with
filesystem corruption reported by many users in which the 'used' space
on a filesystem is negative; fsck -f is needed to correct this.</td>

      update the calibration code to be more precise on 2 March.</td>

    <td>&status.wip;</td>

    <td>Running fsx between a 7.0 NFS client and server

    <td>unreliable serial console</td>
    <td>&status.unknown;</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>At the manual 'root mount' prompt, the serial console is very
      unreliable and drops most characters.  This appears to be caused
      by cngetc() polling the sio driver for input, and the sio driver
      resetting the chip on every poll iteration.  That results in a very
      small window for it to accept input.  Fixing this requires a
      large review of the operation of the sio driver.  The uart driver
      looks to handle this better and might be a suitable replacement.</td>

    <td>Sysinstall could use the same fixes recently made to fdisk so it
      plays nice with GEOM and disk labeling.  This does not cause problems
      during install because nothing on the disk is mounted when its label
      is being manipulated but it can cause problems if sysinstall gets
      used on a live system to adjust labels on existing disks which
      sys-admins tend to do.</td>

      Increasing the kern.maxswzone tunable would be a workaround
      this.  Although a patch from &a.alc; is needed to allow this variable to
      be increased, this is not suitable for 6.1R.  This limitation should
      be documented in the Release Notes.</td>

    <td><em>From the <a
      href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/ideas/">ideas
      page</a>.</em>  Right now we only install a UP kernel, for performance
      reasons. We should be able to package both a UP and SMP kernel
      into the release bits, and have sysinstall install both. It
      should also select the correct one for the target system and
      make that the default on boot. The easiest way to do this would
      be to have sysinstall boot an SMP kernel and then look at the
      hw.ncpu sysctl. The only problem is being able to have
      sysinstall fall back to booting a UP kernel for itself if the
      SMP one fails. This can probably be 'faked' by setting one of
      the SMP-disabling variables in the loader. But in any case, the
      point is to make the process Just Work for the user, without the
      user needing to know arcane loader/sysctl knobs. SMP laptops are
      here, and we should be ready to support SMP out-of-the-box.</td>

<h3>Stress Test Panics</h3>

<a name="stresstest"></a>
<p>The system is continuously being subjected to Peter Holm's <a
  href="http://www.holm.cc/stress/">Kernel Stress Test Suite</a>.  The
  following issues have recently been discovered from this test
  suite.</p>

<h3>sparc64 problems</h3>

<p>These are problems that range in severity for FreeBSD/sparc64.  They
will not hold up the release, but they will still be tracked for future
releases.</p>

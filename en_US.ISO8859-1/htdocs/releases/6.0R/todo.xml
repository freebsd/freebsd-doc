      plays nice with GEOM and disk labeling.  This does not cause problems
      during install because nothing on the disk is mounted when its label

      used on a live system to adjust labels on existing disks which

      This is most often seen when a filesystem fills up and uprintf() is
      called to report it to the console, but it can happen in many other
      places also.  Properly locking the upper and lower parts of the tty
      subsystem likely cannot happen for 6.0, but temporary fixes must be
      developed and committed.  A patch has now been committed that is
      believed to fix this problem by acquiring Giant in uprintf() and
      tprintf(), as well as a regression test.  This work-around has now been
      merged to RELENG_6 and is ready for wide-spread testing.</td>

    <td>panic on multicast socket close after interface removal</td>

    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Due to the addition of multicast locking, a long-present memory
      corruption bug now generates an immediate panic if an interface is
      removed while a multicast group is in use on the interface.  This
      can manifest if running routed and using vlans.  A regression test
      has now been committed as msocket_ifnet_remove.  A short-term fix
      will be to GC references to the interface in the IPv4/IPv6
      multicast socket options hung off of the inpcb; a long term solution
      will require determining the correct application semantics for
      interface removal as relates to multicast sockets.  This problem is
      described in detail in PR kern/77665.  A fix has now been committed
      to 7-CURRENT in the CVS HEAD, and merged to RELENG_6.</td>

      the POSIX named fifo support.  A number of regression tests have been
      written to confirm that any fix does not break fifos, and a number of
      other unrelated bugs were fixed in the process.  The cause of the

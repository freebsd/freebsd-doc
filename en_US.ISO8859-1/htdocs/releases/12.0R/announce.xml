    <h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>

    <p>&os;&nbsp;&thisrelease;-RELEASE is now available for the amd64,
      i386, powerpc, powerpc64, powerpcspe, sparc64, armv6, armv7, and
      aarch64 architectures.</p>

    <p>&os;&nbsp;&thisrelease;-RELEASE can be installed from bootable
      ISO images or over the network.  Some architectures also support
      installing from a USB memory stick.  The required files can be
      downloaded as described in the section below.</p>

    <p>SHA512 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and
      SD card images are included at the bottom of this message.</p>

    <p>PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available
      at:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>A PGP-signed version of this announcement is available at:</p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are
      as follows:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>dvd1</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>This contains everything necessary to install the base &os;
	  operating system, the documentation, debugging distribution
	  sets, and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting
	  a graphical workstation up and running.  It also supports
	  booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.  This should be
	  all you need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.</p>

	<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick
	  (flash drive) for the &arch.amd64; architecture and used to
	  do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives.
	  It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue
	  mode.</p>

	<p>As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming
	  the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something
	  like this should work:</p>

	<pre>
	  # dd if=FreeBSD-&thisrelease;-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso \
	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>disc1</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>This contains the base &os; operating system.  It also
	  supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.  There
	  are no pre-built packages.</p>

	<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick
	  (flash drive) for the &arch.amd64; architecture and used to
	  do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives.
	  It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.
	  There are no pre-built packages.</p>

	  like this should work:</p>

	<pre>
	  # dd if=FreeBSD-&thisrelease;-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso \
	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>bootonly</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but
	  does not contain the installation distribution sets for
	  installing &os; from the CD itself.  You would need to
	  perform a network based install (e.g., from an HTTP or FTP
	  server) after booting from the CD.</p>

	<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick
	  (flash drive) for the &arch.amd64; architecture and used to
	  do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives.
	  It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.
	  There are no pre-built packages.</p>

	  the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something
	  like this should work:</p>

	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>memstick</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive)
	  and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off
	  USB drives.  It also supports booting into a "livefs" based
	  rescue mode.  There are no pre-built packages.</p>

	<p>As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming
	  the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something
	  like this should work:</p>

	<pre>
	  # dd if=FreeBSD-&thisrelease;-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img \
	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>mini-memstick</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive)
	  and used to boot a machine, but does not contain the
	  installation distribution sets on the medium itself, similar
	  to the bootonly image.  It also supports booting into
	  a "livefs" based rescue mode.  There are no pre-built
	  packages.</p>

	<p>As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image,
	  assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine
	  something like this should work:</p>

	<pre>
	  # dd if=FreeBSD-&thisrelease;-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img \
	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>&os;/arm SD card images</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the
	  supported arm system.  The SD card image contains the full
	  &os; installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as
	  small as 512Mb.</p>

	<p>For convenience for those without console access to the
	  system, a <tt>freebsd</tt> user with a password of
	  <tt>freebsd</tt> is available by default for <tt>ssh(1)</tt>
	  access.  Additionally, the <tt>root</tt> user password is
	  set to <tt>root</tt>, which it is strongly recommended to
	  change the password for both users after gaining access to
	  the system.</p>

	<p>To write the &os;/arm image to an SD card, use the
	  <tt>dd(1)</tt> utility, replacing <i>KERNEL</i> with the
	  appropriate kernel configuration name for the system.</p>

	<pre>
	  # dd if=FreeBSD-&thisrelease;-RELEASE-arm-<i>armv7</i>-<i>KERNEL</i>.img \
	    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre>

	<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=)
	  correct.</p>
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>&os;&nbsp;&thisrelease;-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM
      or DVD from several vendors.  One of the vendors that will be
      offering &os;&nbsp;&thisrelease;-based products is:</p>

      amd64 (x86_64), i386 (x86_32), and AArch64 (arm64) architectures
      in <tt>QCOW2</tt>, <tt>VHD</tt>, and <tt>VMDK</tt> disk image
      formats, as well as raw (unformatted) images.</p>

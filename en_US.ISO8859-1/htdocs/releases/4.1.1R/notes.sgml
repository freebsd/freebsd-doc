                                 RELEASE NOTES
                             FreeBSD 4.1.1-RELEASE

Any installation failures or crashes should be reported by using the
send-pr command (those preferring a Web-based interface can also see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html).

For information about FreeBSD and the layout of the 4.1.1-RELEASE
directory (especially if you're installing from floppies!), see
ABOUT.TXT.  For installation instructions, see the INSTALL.TXT and
HARDWARE.TXT files.

For the latest of these 4.1.1-stable snapshots, you should always see:

1. What's new since 4.1-RELEASE
--------------------------------------

1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged 
configurations, has been added.

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added.

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed.

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers.

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit 
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit Ethernet cards.

The ng_bridge(4) node type has been added to the netgraph subsystem.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

GDB now supports hardware watchpoints.

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.0.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README); newaliases is limited to root and
trusted users; and the MSA port (587) is turned on by default.  See
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more information.

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22.

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length
of files, has been added.

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request.

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added. 

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
and /etc/periodic.conf.

logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog.

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.5a, which includes numerous bugfixes
and enhancements.

finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file.

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer
required for USA residents.

sshd now enabled by default on new installs.

The xl(4) driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B MiniPCI
adapters used on some laptops.

killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1).

boot98cfg(8), a PC-98 boot manager installation and configuration
utility, has been added.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.0.

libreadline has been upgraded to 4.1.

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an interface. 

bktr(4) driver update to 2.1.5.  New tuner types have been added, 
and improvememts to the KLD module and to memory allocation have been
made.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------
FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA, MCA and PCI
bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium class machines (though the
386sx is not recommended).  Support for generic IDE or ESDI drive
configurations, various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is
also provided.

What follows is a list of all peripherals currently known to work with
FreeBSD.  Other configurations may also work, we have simply not as yet
received confirmation of this.

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -stable development efforts, you should
definitely join the -stable mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword

Special mention to:

        The donors listed at http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/donors.html

        Justin M. Seger &lt;jseger@FreeBSD.org&gt; for almost single-handedly
        converting the ports collection to ELF.

        Doug Rabson &lt;dfr@FreeBSD.org&gt; and John Birrell &lt;jb@FreeBSD.org&gt;
        for making FreeBSD/alpha happen and to the NetBSD project for
        substantial indirect aid.

        Peter Wemm &lt;peter@FreeBSD.org&gt; for the new kernel module system
        (with substantial aid from Doug Rabson).

        And to the many thousands of FreeBSD users and testers all over the
        world, without whom this release simply would not have been possible.

We sincerely hope you enjoy this release of FreeBSD!

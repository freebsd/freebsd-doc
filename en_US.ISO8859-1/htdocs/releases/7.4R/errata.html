<p>This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 7.4-RELEASE, containing significant
information discovered after the release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
included in the release documentation. This information includes security advisories, as
well as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
installing this version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This errata document for FreeBSD 7.4-RELEASE will be maintained until the release of
FreeBSD 7.5-RELEASE.</p>

<p>This errata document contains &#8220;late-breaking news&#8221; about FreeBSD
7.4-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to
learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and
fixed.</p>

<p>Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for
example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are
kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the &#8220;current errata&#8221;
for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"
target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>, plus any sites which keep up-to-date
mirrors of this location.</p>

<p>Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 7.4-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of
this document (as of the time of the snapshot).</p>

Corrections</a></h2>

<p>A bug in <b class="APPLICATION">OpenSSL</b> that could cause it to parse past the end
of the message was found at the late stage of 7.4-RELEASE release process. The
7.4-RELEASE includes a fix for this issue by importing relevant parts from the OpenSSL
CVS. This could be triggered by an incorrectly formatted ClientHello SSL/TLS handshake
messages. The details can be found at <a
href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20110208.txt"
target="_top">http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20110208.txt</a>.</p>

<p>The shared object version numbers of <b class="APPLICATION">libcrypto</b> and <b
class="APPLICATION">libssl</b> have been decreased from <tt class="LITERAL">6</tt> to <tt
class="LITERAL">5</tt>. These are accidentaly increased on 28 November, 2010 (r215997) as
OpenSSL 0.9.8p was merged. Note that this affects systems running 7-STABLE after that
date (after 7.3-RELEASE), not 7.3-RELEASE and the security branch. Also note that in
FreeBSD 7.4-RELEASE, the library files with the version number <tt class="LITERAL">6</tt>
are still provided as symbolic links to prevent binaries built in the time window with
the accidentaly increased version number from being broken after the system gets updated
to 7.4-RELEASE.</p>

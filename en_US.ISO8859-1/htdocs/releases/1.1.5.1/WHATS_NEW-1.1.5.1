Yes, it's a point release only 3 days after the last one!  A new record
for us!  :-)  In general, this is NOT something we'd actually generally do
but 1.1.5 is a special case, being our last release for this branch and one
likely to be used for some time.  It's worth-while to make sure that as many
of the obvious stumbling blocks are removed, if only to reduce our question
load! :)

Those of you who are staring at this release in indisguised horror after
downloading the entire 1.1.5R release need not worry - upgrading from
1.1.5R to 1.1.5.1R is easy, and I'll show this step by step as I document
each change below.


List of (reported) problems fixed:
----------------------------------

PROBLEM 1:  Telnet/rlogin/su falls over with:
	ld.so: vi: libcrypt.so.1.1: No such file or directory

CAUSE:	During the `non-crypt' build only the libcrypt.a library was removed,
leaving a dependency on libcrypt.so.1.1.  This library is not shipped with
the exportable release, for obvious reasons.

FIX FOR 1.1.5R USERS:	1.1.5R users must install the secrdist.  In the U.S.,
this is easy - just install the one provided with 1.1.5R and skip ahead to
problem 2 since the rest that follows is for non-domestic users only.

Abroad, this is a little harder in that users must grab one of the `foreign'
secrdists from one of the following two sites:

        South Africa:   braae.ru.ac.za:/pub/FreeBSD/securedist/
                        owl.und.ac.za (currently uncertain)
        Iceland:        ftp.veda.is:/pub/crypt/FreeBSD/

These secrdists are compiled for FreeBSD 1.1R, and as such have a shared
library revision number of 1.0 for libcrypt.  This library has NOT changed,
so what I recommend is NOT to install the entire secrdist using the EXTRACT
script, but to simply do the following in a temporary directory somewhere:

    Extract the des tarball as follows:

        cat des_tgz.a* | tar xvzf -

    Move the 1.1 libcrypt shared library (which has NOT changed, despite the
    version number bump) into place like so:
   
        mv usr/lib/libcrypt.so.1.0 /usr/lib/libcrypt.so.1.1

This will leave you a full set of 1.1.5R binaries and a working crypt library.


PROBLEM 2:  Installation onto wd1 fails after insertion of filesystem disk.

CAUSE:	The filesystem floppy didn't have device entries for wd1, making
	installations onto the second drive fail for IDE drives (it works
	for SCSI drives, which were my test case :-( ).

FIX FOR 1.1.5R USERS:	Just grab the filesystem floppy from 1.1.5.1R.


PROBLEM 3:  There are .o files in the sys.* collection of the srcdist.

CAUSE:	The src-tarball target in the installation procedure forgot to
	clean the GENERIC* kernels out before bunding! :(

FIX FOR 1.1.5R USERS:	If you've already grabbed it, don't sweat it - just
remove the extra files and be happy!  If not (say you've already grabbed
the 1.1.5R bindist but not the srcdist), then simply grab the 1.1.5.1R
srcdist.


PROBLEM 4:  EXTRACT.sh in the srcdist can't find the `bin.*' files.

CAUSE:	I moved the bin.aa and bin.ab files to srcbin.aa and srcbin.ab
	in order to avoid problems with the `extract' command, but forgot
	to update the EXTRACT.sh script.

FIX FOR 1.1.5R USERS:	Simply use the `extract' command on srcbin, or
edit the EXTRACT.sh script to look for srcbin.* instead of bin.* (it's
the second extract from the top, after base.*).  You can also simply grab the 
EXTRACT.sh file from 1.1.5.1's srcdist.


PROBLEM 5:  Kerberos source code missing.

CAUSE:	This wasn't really a problem so much as a deliberate omission.
	Kerberos support was never fully integrated from the binary
	distribution point of view and my initial decision was to
	simply leave it out.  I've since reconsidered this decision somewhat
	and decided to make the drop-in sources available at least since
	there's no harm in doing so and they work quite well.  This is, of
	course, encription software subject to the SAME EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
	as the DES code.  Do NOT grab the secrdist distribution if you're
	outside the U.S.!

FIX FOR 1.1.5R USERS:	Grab the 1.1.5.1 secrdist.

That's it!  See, I told you it wasn't so bad! :-)  Of purely academic
interest will probably also be the changes to /usr/src/etc/Makefile
I had to make to fix all the problems above (these were ALL release
problems, not source problems).  I'll be including a diff in this
directory shortly.

Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience some of these problems may have
caused 1.1.5R users!

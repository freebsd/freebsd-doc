<p>This document tries to provide a starting point for those who want to run FreeBSD on
an Alpha-based machine. It is aimed at providing background information on the various
hardware designs. It is not a replacement for the systems manuals.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN46" name="AEN46">2.2 In general, what do you need to run
FreeBSD on an Alpha?</a></h3>

<p>Obviously you will need an Alpha machine that FreeBSD knows about. Alpha machines are
NOT like PCs. There are considerable differences between the various core logic chip sets
and mainboard designs. This means that a kernel needs to know the intimate details of a
particular machine before it can run on it. Throwing some odd <tt
class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> kernel at unknown hardware is almost guaranteed to fail
miserably.</p>

<p>For a machine even to be considered for FreeBSD use please make sure it has the SRM
console firmware installed. Or at least make sure that SRM console firmware is available
for the particular machine type. If FreeBSD does not currently support your machine type,
there is a good chance that this will change at some point in time, assuming SRM is
available. All bets are off when SRM console firmware is not available.</p>

<p>Machines with the ARC or AlphaBIOS console firmware were intended for WindowsNT. Some
have SRM console firmware available in the system ROMs which you only have to select (via
an ARC or AlphaBIOS menu). In other cases you will have to re-flash the ROMs with SRM
code. Check on http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware to see what is available for
your particular system. In any case: no SRM means <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">no</i></span> FreeBSD (or NetBSD, OpenBSD, Tru64 Unix or OpenVMS for
that matter). With the demise of WindowsNT/alpha a lot of former NT boxes are sold on the
second hand market. They have little or no trade-in value when they are NT-only from the
console firmware perspective. So, be suspicious if the price appears too good.</p>

<p>In case you have problems making your selection of SRM 'stick', in other words if the
system falls back to AlphaBIOS after you selected the SRM console, it is time to check if
the battery of your CMOS clock/parameter RAM is empty. If so, a replacement battery most
likely fixes the issue.</p>

<p>Known non-SRM machines are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Digital XL series</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Digital XLT series</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Samsung PC164UX (&#8220;Ruffian&#8221;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Samsung 164B</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Machines that have SRM but are not supported by FreeBSD are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>DECpc 150 (&#8220;Jensen&#8221;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>DEC 2000/300 (&#8220;Jensen&#8221;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>DEC 2000/500 (&#8220;Culzean&#8221;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>AXPvme series (&#8220;Medulla&#8221;)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To complicate things a bit further: Digital used to have so called
&#8220;white-box&#8221; Alpha machines destined as NT-only and &#8220;blue-box&#8221;
Alpha machines destined for OpenVMS and Digital Unix. These names are based on the color
of the cabinets, &#8220;FrostWhite&#8221; and &#8220;TopGunBlue&#8221; respectively.
Although you could put the SRM console firmware on a whitebox, OpenVMS and Digital Unix
will refuse to boot on them. FreeBSD in post-4.0-RELEASE will run on both the white and
the blue-box variants. Before someone asks: the white ones had a rather different (read:
cheaper) Digital price tag.</p>

<p>As part of the SRM you will get the so called OSF/1 PAL code (OSF/1 being the initial
name of Digital's UNIX offering on Alpha). The PAL code can be thought of as a software
abstraction layer between the hardware and the operating system. It uses normal CPU
instruction plus a handful of privileged instructions specific for PAL use. PAL is not
microcode. The ARC console firmware contains a different PAL code, geared towards WinNT
and in no way suitable for use by FreeBSD (or more generic: Unix or OpenVMS). Before
someone asks: Linux/alpha brings its own PAL code, allowing it to boot on ARC and
AlphaBIOS. There are various reasons why this is not a very good idea in the eyes of the
*BSD folks. I don't want to go into details here. If you are interested in the gory
details search the FreeBSD and NetBSD web sites.</p>

<p>There is another pitfall ahead: you will need a disk adapter that the SRM console
firmware recognizes in order to be able to boot from a disk. What is acceptable to SRM as
a boot adapter is unfortunately highly system and SRM version dependent. For older PCI
based machines it means you will need either a NCR/Symbios 53C810 based adapter, or a
Qlogic 1020/1040 based adapter. Some machines come with a SCSI chip embedded on the
mainboard. Newer machine designs and SRM versions will be able to work with more modern
SCSI chips/adapters. Check out the machine specific info below. Please note that the rest
of this discussion only refers to Symbios chips, this is meant to include the older chips
that still have NCR stamped on them. Symbios bought NCR sometime.</p>

<p>The problem might bite those who have machines that started their lives as WindowsNT
boxes. The ARC or AlphaBIOS knows about <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">other</i></span> adapter types that it can boot from than the SRM. For
example you can boot from an Adaptec 2940UW with ARC/AlphaBios but (generally) not with
SRM. Some newer machine types have introduced Adaptec boot support. Please consult the
machine specific section for details.</p>

<p>Most adapters that cannot be booted from work fine for data-only disks. The
differences between SRM and ARC could also get you pre-packaged IDE CDROMs and hard
drives in some (former WindowsNT) systems. SRM versions exist (depends on the machine
type) that can boot from IDE disks and CDROMs. Check the machine specific section for
details.</p>

<p>In order to be bootable the root partition (partition a) must be at offset 0 of the
disk drive. This means you have to use the installer's partitioning menu and start with
assigning partition a at offset 0 to the root partition. Subsequently layout the rest of
the partitions to your liking. If you do not adhere to this rule the install will proceed
just fine, but the system will not be bootable from the freshly installed disk. Note that
fdisk is not used on FreeBSD running on Alpha, disks are directly labeled using
disklabel.</p>

<p>If you don't have/want a local disk drive you can boot via the Ethernet. This assumes
an Ethernet adapter/chip that is recognized by the SRM console. Generally speaking this
boils down to either a 21040 or 21142 or 21143 based Ethernet interface. Older machines
or SRM versions may not recognize the 21142 / 21143 Fast Ethernet chips, you are then
limited to using 10Mbit Ethernet for net booting those machines. Non-DEC cards based on
said chips will generally (but are not guaranteed to) work. Note that Intel took over the
21x4x chips when it bought Digital Semiconductor. So you might see an Intel logo on them
these days. Recent machine designs have SRM support for Intel 8255x Ethernet chips.</p>

<p>Alpha machines can be run with SRM on a graphics console or on a serial console. ARC
can also be run on a serial consoles if need be. VT100 emulation with 8 bit controls
should at least allow you to switch from ARC/AlphaBIOS to SRM mode without having to
install a graphics card first.</p>

<p>If you want to run your Alpha machine without a monitor/graphics card just don't
connect a keyboard/mouse to the machine. Instead hook up a serial terminal[emulator] to
serial port #1. The SRM will talk 9600N81 to you. This can also be really practical for
debugging purposes. Beware: some/most (?) SRMs will also present you with a console
prompt at serial port #2. The booting kernel, however, will display the boot messages on
serial port #1 and will also put the console there. <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">This can be extremely confusing.</i></span></p>

<p>Most PCI based Alphas can use ordinary PC-type VGA cards. The SRM contains enough
smarts to make that work. It does not, however, mean that each and every PCI VGA card out
on the street will work in an Alpha machine. Things like S3 Trio64, Mach64, and Matrox
Millennium generally work. Old ET4000 based ISA cards have also worked for me. But ask
around first before buying.</p>

<p>Most PCI devices from the PC-world will also work in FreeBSD PCI-based machines. Check
the <tt class="FILENAME">/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</tt> file for the latest word on this.
Check the appropriate machine type's discussion in case you want to use PCI cards that
have PCI bridge chips on them. In some cases you might encounter problems with PCI cards
not handling PCI parity correctly. This can lead to panics. PCI parity checking can be
disabled using the following SRM command:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET PCI_PARITY OFF</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This is not a FreeBSD problem, all operating systems running on Alpha hardware will
need this workaround.</p>

<p>If your system (also) contains EISA expansion slots you will need to run the EISA
Configuration Utility (ECU) after you have installed EISA cards or after you have
upgraded your console firmware.</p>

<p>For Alpha CPUs you will find multiple generations. The original Alpha design is the
21064. It was produced in a chip process called MOS4, chips made in this process are
nicknamed EV4. Newer CPUs are 21164, 21264 etc. You will see designations like EV4S,
EV45, EV5, EV56, EV6, EV67, EV68. The EVs with double digit numbers are slightly improved
versions. For example EV45 has an improved FPU and 16 kByte on-chip separate I &amp; D
caches compared to the EV4 on which it is based. Rule of thumb: the higher the digit
immediately following &#8220;EV&#8221; the more desirable (read: faster / more modern).
Spending money on anything less than an EV5 is not recommended. Hardware available for
free is a different matter of course.</p>

<p>For memory you want at least 32 Mbytes. I have had FreeBSD run on a 16 Mbyte system
years ago but you will not enjoy that. Kernel build times halved when I went to 32
Mbytes. Note that the SRM console steals 2Mbyte from the total system memory (and keeps
it). For more serious work 128 Mbytes or more are recommended. Although Alpha machines
typically can accommodate large to very large physical memory sizes, FreeBSD is limited
to 1 or 2 Gbytes (dependent on the core chipset) of RAM. This restriction is due to the
current implementation of the VM system.</p>

<p>While on the subject of memory: pay close attention to the type of memory your machine
uses. There are very different memory configurations and requirements for the various
machines.</p>

<p>Final word: I expect the above to sound a bit daunting to the first-time Alpha user.
Don't be daunted too much. And do feel free to ask questions if something is not clear
after reading this document.</p>

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN107" name="AEN107">2.3 System-specific information</a></h3>

<p>Below is an overview of the hardware that FreeBSD runs on. This list will definitely
grow, a look in <tt class="FILENAME">/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</tt> can be
enlightening.</p>

<p>Alpha machines are often best known by their project code name. Where known these are
listed below in parentheses.</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<hr />
<h4 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN112" name="AEN112">2.3.1 AXPpci33
(&#8220;NoName&#8221;)</a></h4>

<p>The NoName is a baby-AT mainboard based on the 21066 LCA (Low Cost Alpha) processor.
NoName was originally designed for OEM-use. The LCA chip includes almost all of the logic
to drive a PCI bus and the memory subsystem. All of this makes for a low-priced
design.</p>

<p>Due to the limited memory interface the system is not particularly fast in case of
cache misses. As long as you stay inside the on-chip cache the CPU is comparable to a
21064 (first generation Alpha). These boards should be very cheap to obtain these days.
It is a full-fledged 64 bit CPU, just don't expect miracles as far as speed goes.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>21066 Alpha CPU at 166 MHz or 21066A CPU at 233MHz. 21068 CPUs are also possible, but
are even slower.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>on-board Bcache / L2 cache: 0, 256k or 1 Mbyte (uses DIL chips)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PS/2 mouse &#38; keyboard port OR 5pin DIN keyboard (2 mainboard models)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>bus width: 64 bits</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PS/2 style 72 pin 36 bit Fast Page Mode SIMMs</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>70ns or better</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>installed in pairs of 2</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>4 SIMM sockets</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>uses ECC</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>512kB Flash ROM for the console code.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2 16550A serial ports</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>1 parallel port</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>floppy interface</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>1 embedded IDE interface</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>expansion:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3 32 bit PCI slots (1 shared with ISA)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>5 ISA slots (1 shared with PCI)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>embedded Fast SCSI using a Symbios 53C810 chip</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>NoNames can either have SRM <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">or</i></span>
ARC console firmware in their Flash ROM. The Flash ROM is not big enough to hold both ARC
and SRM at the same time and allow software selection of alternate console code. But you
only need SRM anyway.</p>

<p>Cache for the NoNames are 15 or 20 ns DIL chips. For a 256 kByte cache you want to
check your junked 486 mainboard. Chips for a 1 Mbyte cache are a rarer breed
unfortunately. Getting at least a 256kByte cache is recommended performance wise.
Cache-less they are really slow.</p>

<p>The NoName mainboard has a PC/AT-standard power connector. It also has a power
connector for 3.3 Volts. No need to rush out to get a new power supply. The 3.3 Volts is
only needed in case you run 3.3 Volts PCI expansion boards. These are quite rare.</p>

<p>The IDE interface is supported by FreeBSD and requires a line in the kernel
configuration file as follows:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device ata
</pre>

<p>The ATA interface uses irq 14.</p>

<p>The SRM console unfortunately <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">cannot
boot</i></span> from IDE disks. This means you will have to use a SCSI disk as the boot
device.</p>

<p>The NoName is somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial consoles. It needs</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE SERIAL</kbd>
</pre>

<p>before it goes for a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from the machine is not
sufficient, like it is on most other Alpha models. Going back to a graphical console
needs</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</kbd>
</pre>

<p>at the serial console.</p>

<p>There have been reports that you sometimes need to press <b
class="KEYCAP">Control</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">Alt</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">Del</b> to capture
the SRM's attention. I have never seen this myself, but it is worth trying if you are
greeted by a blank screen after powerup.</p>

<p>Make sure you use true 36 bit SIMMs, and only FPM (Fast Page Mode) DRAM. EDO DRAM or
SIMMs with fake parity <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">will not
work</i></span>. The board uses the 4 extra bits for ECC. 33 bit FPM SIMMs will for the
same reason not work.</p>

<p>Given the choice, get the PS/2-variant mainboard. Apart from giving you a mouse port
as bonus it is directly supported by Tru64 Unix in case you ever want or need to run it.
The &#8220;DIN-plug&#8221;-variant should work OK for FreeBSD.</p>

<p>The <a href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/axppci/design_guide.ps" target="_top">OEM
manual</a> is recommended reading.</p>

<p>The kernel configuration file for a NoName kernel must contain:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options    DEC_AXPPCI_33           
cpu EV4
</pre>

<h4 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN187" name="AEN187">2.3.2 Personal Workstation
(&#8220;Miata&#8221;)</a></h4>

<p>The Miata is a small tower machine intended to be put under a desk. There are multiple
Miata variants. The original Miata is the MX5 model. Because it suffers from a number of
hardware design flaws a redesign was done, yielding the MiataGL. Unfortunately the
variants are not easily distinguishable at first sight from the outside of the case. An
easy check is to see if the back of the machine sports two USB connectors. If yes, it is
a MiataGL. MX5 models tend to be more common in the used system market place.</p>

<p>System designations look like &#8220;Personal Workstation 433a&#8221;. Personal
Workstation, being a bit of a mouthful, is often abbreviated to PWS. This means it has a
433 MHz CPU, and started life as a WinNT workstation (the trailing &#8220;a&#8221;).
Systems designated from day 1 to run Tru64 Unix or OpenVMS will sport
&#8220;433au&#8221;. WinNT-Miatas are likely to come pre-configured with an IDE CDROM
drive. So, in general systems are named like PWS[433,500,600]a[u].</p>

<p>There was also a Miata model with a special CPU cooling system by Kryotech. The
Kryotech has a special cooling system and is housed in a different enclosure.</p>

<p>The Miata logic is divided into two printed circuit boards. The lower board in the
bottom of the machine has the PCI and ISA slots and things like the sound chip etc. The
top board has the CPU, the Pyxis chip, memory etc. Note that MX5 and the MiataGL use a
different PCI riser board. This means that you cannot just upgrade to a MiataGL CPU board
(with the newer Pyxis chip) but that you will also need a different riser board.
Apparently an MX5 riser with a MiataGL CPU board will work but it is definitely not a
supported or tested configuration. Everything else (cabinet, wiring, etc.) is identical
for MX5 and MiataGL.</p>

<p>MX5 has problems with DMA via the 2 64-bit PCI slots when this DMA crosses a page
boundary. The 32 bit slots don't have this problem because the PCI-PCI bridge chip does
not allow the offending transfers. The SRM code knows about the problem and refuses to
start the system if there is a PCI card in one of the 64bit slots that it does not know
about. Cards that are &#8220;known good&#8221; to the SRM are allowed to be used in the
64bit slots.</p>

<p>If you want to fool the SRM you can type <kbd class="USERINPUT">set
pci_device_override</kbd> at the SRM prompt. Just don't complain if your data
mysteriously gets mangled.</p>

<p>The complete command is:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE <tt
class="REPLACEABLE"><i>&lt;vendor_id&gt;</i></tt><tt
class="REPLACEABLE"><i>&lt;device_id&gt;</i></tt></kbd>
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE 88c15333</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The most radical approach is to use:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE -1</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This disables PCI ID checking altogether, so that you can install any PCI card without
its ID getting checked. For this to work you need a reasonable current SRM version.</p>

Jan  3 12:22:32 miata /kernel: pcib0: &lt;2117x PCI host bus adapter&gt; on cia0
</pre>

<p>MiataGL does not have the DMA problems of the MX5. PCI cards that make the MX5 SRM
choke when installed in the 64bit slots are accepted without problems by the MiataGL
SRM.</p>

<p>The latest mainboard revisions of MX5 contain a hardware workaround for the bug. The
SRM does not know about the ECO and will complain about unknown cards as before. So does
the FreeBSD kernel by the way.</p>

<p>The Miata SRM can boot from IDE CDROM drives. IDE hard disk boot is known to work for
both MiataGL and MX5 disks, so you can root FreeBSD from an IDE disk. Speeds on MX5 are
around 14 Mbytes/sec assuming a suitable drive. Miata's CMD646 chip will support up to
WDMA2 mode as the chip is too buggy for use with UDMA.</p>

<p>Miata MX5s generally use Qlogic 1040 based SCSI adapters. These are bootable by the
SRM console. Note that Adaptec cards are <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> bootable by the Miata SRM console.</p>

<p>The MiataGL has a faster PCI-PCI bridge chip on the PCI riser card than some of the
MX5 riser card versions. Some of the MX5 risers have the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">same</i></span> chip as the MiataGL. All in all there is a lot of
variation.</p>

<p>Not all VGA cards will work behind the PCI-PCI bridge. This manifests itself as no
video at all. Workaround is to put the VGA card &#8220;before&#8221; the bridge, in one
of the 64 bit PCI slots. Graphics performance using a 64 bit slot is generally
substantially better.</p>

<p>Both MX5 and MiataGL have an on-board sound chip, an ESS1888. It emulates a
SoundBlaster and can be enabled by putting</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device pcm
device  sbc
</pre>

<p>in your kernel configuration file:</p>

<p>in case your Miata has the optional cache board installed make sure it is firmly
seated. A slightly loose cache has been observed to cause weird crashes (not surprising
obviously, but maybe not so obvious when troubleshooting). The cache module is identical
between MX5 and MiataGL.</p>

<p>Installing a 2Mb cache module achieves, apart from a 10-15% speed increase (based on
buildworld elapsed time), a <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">decrease</i></span> for PCI DMA read bandwidth from 64bit PCI cards. A
benchmark on a 64-bit Myrinet card resulted in a decrease from 149 Mbytes/sec to 115
Mbytes/sec. Something to keep in mind when doing really high speed things with 64 bit PCI
adapters.</p>

<p>Although the hardware allows you to install up to 1.5Gbyte of memory, FreeBSD is
limited to 1Gbyte because the DMA code does not correctly handle memory above 1Gbyte.</p>

<p>Moving to a faster CPU is quite simple, swap out the CPU chip and set the clock
multiplier dipswitch to the speed of the new CPU.</p>

<p>If you experience SRM errors like</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
ERROR: scancode 0xa3 not supported on PCXAL
</pre>

<p>after halting FreeBSD you should update your SRM firmware to V7.2-1 or later. This SRM
version is first available on the Firmware Update CD V5.7, or on <a
href="http://www.compaq.com/" target="_top">http://www.compaq.com/</a> This SRM problem
is fixed on both Miata MX5 and Miata GL.</p>

<p>In its attempts to popularize the Alpha CPU DEC produced a number of so called
Evaluation Boards. Members of this family are EB64, EB64+, AlphaPC64 (codename
&#8220;Cabriolet&#8221;). A non-DEC member of this family is the Aspen Alpine. The EB64
family of evaluation boards has the following feature set:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>21064 or 21064A CPU, 150 to 275 MHz</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>memory:</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>21072 (&#8220;APECS&#8221;) chip set</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Intel 82378ZB PCI to ISA bridge chip (&#8220;Saturn&#8221;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>dual 16550A serial ports</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Symbios 53C810 Fast-SCSI (not on AlphaPC64)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>IDE interface (only on AlphaPC64)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>embedded 10 Mbit Ethernet (not on AlphaPC64)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2 PCI slots (4 slots on AlphaPC64)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3 ISA slots</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Aspen Alpine is slightly different, but is close enough to the EB64+ to run an EB64+
SRM EPROM (mine did..). The Aspen Alpine does not have an embedded Ethernet, has 3
instead of 2 PCI slots. It comes with 2 Mbytes of cache already soldered onto the
mainboard. It has jumpers to select the use of 60, 70 or 80ns SIMM speeds.</p>

<p>36 bits SIMMs work fine, 3 bits simply remain unused. Note the systems use Fast Page
Mode memory, not EDO memory.</p>

<p>The EB64+ SRM console code is housed in an UV-erasable EPROM. No easy flash SRM
upgrades for the EB64+ The latest SRM version available for EB64+ is quite ancient
anyway.</p>

<p>The EB64+ SRM can boot both 53C810 and Qlogic1040 SCSI adapters. Pitfall for the
Qlogic is that the firmware that is down-loaded by the SRM onto the Qlogic chip is very
old. There are no updates for the EB64+ SRM available. So you are stuck with old Qlogic
bits too. I have had quite some problems when I wanted to use Ultra-SCSI drives on the
Alpine with Qlogic. The FreeBSD kernel can be compiled to include a much newer Qlogic
firmware revision. This is not the default because it adds hundreds of kBytes worth of
bloat to the kernel. In FreeBSD 4.1 and later the isp firmware is contained in a kernel
loadable module. All of this might mean that you need to use a non-Qlogic adapter to boot
from.</p>

<p>AlphaPC64 boards generally come with ARC console firmware. SRM console code can be
loaded from floppy into the Flash ROM.</p>

<p>The IDE interface of the AlphaPC64 is not bootable from the SRM console. Enabling it
requires the following line in the kernel configuration file:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device ata
</pre>

<p>The ATA interface uses irq 14.</p>

<p>Note that the boards require a power supply that supplies 3.3 Volts for the CPU.</p>

<p>EB164 is a newer design evaluation board, based on the 21164A CPU. This design has
been used to &#8220;spin off&#8221; multiple variations, some of which are used by OEM
manufacturers/assembly shops. Samsung did its own PC164LX which has only 32 bit PCI,

</ul>

<p>Using 8 SIMMs for a 256bit wide memory can yield interesting speedups over a 4
SIMM/128bit wide memory. Obviously all 8 SIMMs must be of the same type to make this
work. The system must be explicitly setup to use the 8 SIMM memory arrangement. You must
have 8 SIMMs, 4 SIMMs distributed over 2 banks will not work. For the AlphaPC164 you can
have a maximum of 1Gbyte of RAM, using 8 128Mbyte SIMMs. The manual indicates the maximum
is 512 Mbyte.</p>

<p>The SRM can boot from Qlogic 10xx boards or the Symbios 53C810[A]. Newer Symbios 810
revisions like the Symbios 810AE are not recognized by the SRM on PC164. PC164 SRM does
not appear to recognize a Symbios 53C895 based host adapter (tested with a Tekram
DC-390U2W). On the other hand some no-name Symbios 53C985 board has been reported to
work. Cards like the Tekram DC-390F (Symbios875 based) have been confirmed to work fine
on the PC164. Symbios 53C896 has been confirmed to not work.</p>

<p>Symbios 53C825[a] will also work as boot adapter. Diamond FirePort, although based on
Symbios chips, is not bootable by the PC164SX SRM. PC164SX is reported to boot fine with
Symbios825, Symbios875, Symbios895 and Symbios876 based cards. In addition, Adaptec 2940U
and 2940UW are reported to work for booting (verified on SRM V5.7-1). Adaptec 2930U2 and
2940U2[W] do not work.</p>

<p>164LX and 164SX with SRM firmware version 5.8 or later can boot from Adaptec
2940-series adapters. A test with an Adaptec 3940UW showed that that one is not supported
however. 164SX SRM recognises Intel 8255x Ethernet cards which show up as eia. Using such
a NIC allows network booting.</p>

<p>In summary: this family of machines is &#8220;blessed&#8221; with a challenging
compatibility as far as SCSI adapters go.</p>

<p>On 164SX you can have a maximum of 1 Gbyte of RAM. 4 regular (PC100 or PC133) 256MB
DIMMs are reported to work just fine. Whether 512MB DIMMs will also work is currently
unknown. You can use ECC or non-ECC DIMMs. The non-ECC ones are the same as commonly
found in PCs. Unfortunately the 164SX is quite picky on which DIMMs it likes, so be
prepared to test and experiment.</p>

<p>PCI bridge chips are sometimes not appreciated by the 164SX, they cause SRM errors and
kernel panics in those cases. This seems to depend on the fact if the card is recognised,
and therefore correctly initialised, by the SRM console. The 164SX' onboard IDE interface
is quite slow, a Promise card gives a 3-4 times speed improvement.</p>

<p>On PC164 the SRM sometimes seems to lose its variable settings. &#8220;For PC164,
current superstition says that, to avoid losing settings, you want to first downgrade to
SRM 4.x and then upgrade to 5.x.&#8221; One sample error that was observed was:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
ERROR: ISA table corrupt!
</pre>

<p>A sequence of a downgrade to SRM4.9, an</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">ISACFG -INIT</kbd>
</pre>

<p>followed by</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">INIT</kbd>
</pre>

<p>made the problem go away. Some PC164 owners report they have never seen the
problem.</p>

<p>On PC164SX the AlphaBIOS allows you a selection to select SRM to be used as console on
the next power up. This selection does not appear to have any effect. In other words, you
will get the AlphaBIOS regardless of what you select. The fix is to reflash the console
ROM with the SRM code for PC164SX. This will overwrite the AlphaBIOS and will get you the
SRM console you desire. The SRM code can be found on the Compaq Web site.</p>

<p>164LX can either have the SRM console code or the AlphaBIOS code in its flash ROM
because the flash ROM is too small to hold both at the same time.</p>

<p>PC164 can boot from IDE disks assuming your SRM version is recent enough.</p>

<p>EB164 needs a power supply that supplies 3.3 Volts. PC164 does not implement the PS_ON
signal that ATX power supplies need to switch on. A simple switch pulling this signal to
ground allows you to run a standard ATX power supply.</p>

<p>For the EB164 class machines the kernel config file must contain:</p>

<p>Early machines had Fast SCSI interfaces, later ones are Ultra SCSI capable. AS500
shares its single SCSI bus with internal and external devices. For a Fast SCSI bus you
are limited to 1.8 meters bus length external to the box. The AS500 Qlogic ISP1020A chip
can be set to run in Ultra mode by setting a SRM variable. FreeBSD however follows the
Qlogic chip errata and limits the bus speed to Fast.</p>

<p>Beware of ancient SRM versions on AS500. When you see weird SCSI speeds being reported
by FreeBSD like</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
cd0 at isp0 bus 0 target 4 lun 0
cd0: &lt;DEC RRD45   DEC 0436&gt; Removable CD-ROM SCSI-2 device
cd0: 250.000MB/s transfers (250.000MHz, offset 12)
</pre>

<p>it is time to do a SRM console firmware upgrade.</p>

<p>AS600 has one Qlogic SCSI chip dedicated to the internal devices whereas the other
Qlogic SCSI chip is dedicated to external SCSI devices. Keep the card, which apart from
the two SCSI interfaces also houses the Ethernet chip by the way in the DEC-recommended,
topmost, 32bit PCI slot. You get machine checks if you plug it into one of the 64 bit
slots.</p>

<p>In AS500 DIMMs are installed in sets of 4, in &#8220;physically interleaved&#8221;
layout. So, a bank of 4 DIMMs is <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> 4 physically adjacent DIMMs. Note that the DIMMs are
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> SDRAM DIMMs.</p>

<p>In AS600 the memory SIMMs are placed onto two memory daughter cards. SIMMs are
installed in sets of 8. Both memory daughter cards must be populated identically.</p>

<p>Note that both AS500 and AS600 are EISA machines. This means you have to run the EISA
Configuration Utility (ECU) from floppy after adding EISA cards or to change things like
the configuration settings of the onboard I/O. For AS500 which does not have a physical
EISA slot the ECU is used to configure the onboard sound interface etc.</p>

<p>AS500 onboard sound can be used by adding a line like</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device pcm
</pre>

<p>to the kernel configuration file.</p>

<p>Using the ECU I configured my AS500 to use IRQ 10, port 0x530, drq 0. Corresponding
entries along with flags 0x10011 must go into the <tt class="FILENAME">device.hints</tt>
file. Note that the flags value is rather non-standard.</p>

<p>AS600 has a peculiarity for its PCI slots. AS600 (or rather the PCI expansion card
containing the SCSI adapters) does not allow I/O port mapping, therefore all devices
behind it must use memory mapping. If you have problems getting the Qlogic SCSI adapters
to work, add the following option to <tt class="FILENAME">/boot/loader.rc</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
set isp_mem_map=0xff
</pre>

<p>This may need to be typed at the boot loader prompt before booting the installation
kernel.</p>

<p>For the AlphaStation-[56]00 machines the kernel config file must contain:</p>

(&#8220;Mikasa&#8221;), 1000A (&#8220;Noritake&#8221;) and
800(&#8220;Corelle&#8221;)</a></h4>

<p>The AlphaServer 1000 and 800 range of machines are intended as departmental servers.
They come in quite some variations in packaging and mainboard/cpu. Generally speaking
there are 21064 (EV4) CPU based machines and 21164 (EV5) based ones. The CPU is on a
daughter card, and the type of CPU (EV4 or EV5) must match the mainboard in use.</p>

<p>AlphaServer 800 has a much smaller mini tower case, it lacks the StorageWorks SCSI
hot-plug chassis. Instead, it has a disk cage that allows up to 4 fullheight 3.5" SCA
SCSI disks to be installed. The carriers used to mount the disks are specific to the
AlphaServer 800. The main difference between AS1000 and AS1000A is that AS1000A has 7 PCI
slots whereas AS1000 only has 3 PCI slots and has EISA slots instead.</p>

<p>The AlphaServer 800 system has a smart power controller. This means that parts of the
system remain powered when it is switched off (like an ATX-style PC power supply). Before
servicing the machine remove the power cord.</p>

<p>The smart power controller is called the RMC. When enabled, typing <b
class="KEYCAP">Escape</b><b class="KEYCAP">Escape</b>RMC on serial port 1 will bring you
to the RMC prompt. RMC allows you to powerup or powerdown, reset the machine, monitor and
set temperature trip levels etc. RMC has its own builtin help.</p>

<p>AlphaServer 800 with an EV5/400 MHz CPU was later re-branded to become a
&#8220;DIGITAL Server 3300[R]&#8221;, AlphaServer 800 with an EV5/500 MHz CPU was later
re-branded to become a &#8220;DIGITAL Server 3305[R]&#8221;.</p>

<p>AS1000 based machines come in multiple enclosure types. Floor standing, rack-mount,
with or without StorageWorks SCSI chassis etc. The electronics are the same.</p>

<p>AS1000-systems: All EV4 based machines use standard PS/2 style 36 bit 72pin SIMMs in
sets of 5. The fifth SIMM is used for ECC. All EV5 based machines use standard PS/2 style
36 bit 72pin SIMMs in sets of 4. The ECC is done based on the 4 extra bits per SIMM (4
bits out of 36). The EV5 mainboards have 16 SIMM slots, the EV4 mainboards have 20
slots.</p>

<p>AS800 machines use DIMMs in sets of 4. DIMM installation must start in slots marked
bank 0. A bank is four physically adjacent slots. The biggest size DIMMs must be
installed in bank 0 in case 2 banks of different DIMM sizes are used. Max memory size is
2GB. Note that it uses buffered EDO DIMMs.</p>

<p>The AS1000/800 are somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial consoles. They need</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE SERIAL</kbd>
</pre>

<p>before they go for a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from the machine is not
sufficient, like it is on most other Alpha models. Going back to a graphical console
needs</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</kbd>
</pre>

<p>at the serial console.</p>

<p>For AS800 you want to check if your Ultra-Wide SCSI is indeed in Ultra mode. This can
be done using the <tt class="FILENAME">EEROMCFG.EXE</tt> utility that is on the Console
Firmware Upgrade CDROM.</p>

<p>Webbrick is shipped in a desktop-style case similar to the older 21164
&#8220;Maverick&#8221; workstations but this case offers much better access to the
components. If you intend to build a farm you can rackmount them in a 19-inch rack; they
are 3U high. Slate is 1U high but has only one PCI slot.</p>

<p>DS10 has 4 DIMM slots. DIMMs are installed as pairs. Please note that DIMM pairs are
not installed in adjacent DIMM sockets but rather physically interleaved. DIMM sizes of
32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 Mbytes are supported.</p>

<p>When 2 pairs of identical-sized DIMMs are installed DS10 will use memory interleaving
for increased performance. DS10L, which has only 2 DIMM slots cannot do interleaving.</p>

<p>Starting with SRM firmware version 5.9 you can boot from Adaptec 2940-series adapters
in addition to the usual set of Qlogic and Symbios/NCR adapters. KZPEA aka Adaptec 39160
gives you dual channel LVD U160 SCSI which is bootable from SRM.</p>

<p>The base model comes with a FUJITSU 9.5GB ATA disk as its boot device. FreeBSD works
just fine using EIDE disks on Webbrick. DS10 has 2 IDE interfaces on the mainboard.
Machines destined for Tru64 Unix or VMS are standard equipped with Qlogic-driven
Ultra-SCSI disks</p>

<p>On the PCI bus 32 and 64 bit cards are supported, in 3.3V and 5V variants.</p>

that of Webbrick. The DIMMs live on the CPU daughter-card. Note that the system uses ECC
RAM so you need DIMMs with 72 bits (not the generic PC-class 64 bit DIMMs)</p>

<p>The EIDE interface is usable / SRM bootable so FreeBSD can be rooted on an EIDE disk.

to the RMC prompt. RMC allows you to powerup or powerdown, reset the machine, monitor and
set temperature trip levels etc. RMC has its own builtin help.</p>

<p>The embedded Adaptec SCSI on the DS20 is disabled and is therefore not usable under
FreeBSD. On the DS20E with recent SRM console code you can use them with FreeBSD.</p>

<p>Starting with SRM firmware version 5.9 you can boot from Adaptec 2940-series adapters
in addition to the usual set of Qlogic and Symbios/NCR adapters. This unfortunately does
not include the embedded Adaptec SCSI chips. You can use a KZPEA aka Adaptec 39160 for
dual channel LVD U160 SCSI, which is bootable from SRM. For a single channel LVD Ultra2
SCSI adapter you can use a LSI Logic / Symbios Sym8952u card.</p>

<p>If you are using banks of DIMMs of different sizes the biggest DIMMs should be
installed in the DIMM slots marked <tt class="LITERAL">0</tt> on the mainboard. The DIMM
slots should be filled &#8220;in order&#8221; so after bank 0 install in bank 1 and so
on.</p>

<p>Don't try to use Symbios-chip based SCSI adapters in the PCI slots connected to hose
1. There is a not-yet-found FreeBSD bug that prevents this from working correctly. DS20
ships by default with a Symbios on hose 1 so you have to move this card before you can
install/boot FreeBSD on it.</p>

<p>The AlphaServer 2[01]00 machines are intended as departmental servers. This is medium
iron. They are multi-CPU machines, up to 2 CPUs (AS2000) or 4 CPUs (2100[A]) can be
installed. Both floor-standing and 19&quot; rackmount boxes exist. Rackmount variations
have different numbers of I/O expansion slots, different max number of CPUs and different
maximum memory size. Some of the boxes come with an integral StorageWorks shelf to house
hot-swap SCSI disks. There was an upgrade program available to convert your Sable machine
into a Lynx by swapping the I/O backplane (the C-bus backplane remains). CPU upgrades
were available as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>21064 EV4[5] CPU[s] at 200, 233, 275 MHz or 21164 EV5[6] CPU[s]s at 250, 300, 375, 400

<li>
<p>PS/2 style keyboard &#38; mouse port</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The CPUs spec-ed as 200 MHz are in reality running at 190 MHz. Maximum number of CPUs
is 4. All CPUs must be of the same type/speed.</p>

<p>If any of the processors are ever marked as failed, they will remain marked as failed
even after they have been replaced (or reseated) until you issue the command</p>

</pre>

<p>on the SRM console and power-cycle the machine. This may be true for other modules (IO
and memory) as well, but it has not been verified.</p>

<p>The machines use dedicated memory boards. These boards live on a 128 bit C-bus shared
with the CPU boards. DemiSable supports up to 1GB, Sable up to 2GB. One of the memory bus
slots can either hold a CPU or a memory card. A 4 CPU machine can have a maximum of 2
memory boards.</p>

<p>Some memory board models house SIMMs. These are called SIMM carriers. There are also
memory modules that have soldered-on memory chips instead of SIMMs. These are called
&#8220;flat memory modules&#8221;.</p>

<p>SIMM boards are used in sets of eight 72-pin 36 bit FPM memory of 70ns or faster. SIMM
types supported are 1M x36 bit (4 Mbyte), 2M x36bit (8 Mbyte) and 4M x36 bit (16 Mbyte).
Each memory board can house 4 banks of SIMMs. SIMM sizes can not be mixed on a single
memory board. The first memory module must be filled with SIMMs before starting to fill
the next memory module. Note that the spacing between the slots is not that big, so make
sure your SIMMs fit physically (before buying them..)</p>

<p>Both Lynx and Sable are somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial consoles. They
need</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE SERIAL</kbd>
</pre>

<p>before they go for a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from the machine is not
sufficient, like it is on many other Alpha models. Going back to a graphical console
needs</p>

class="USERINPUT">SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</kbd>
</pre>

<p>at the serial console. On Lynx keep the VGA card in one of the primary PCI slots. EISA
VGA cards are not slot sensitive.</p>

<p>The machines are equipped with a small OCP (Operator Control Panel) LCD screen. On
this screen the self-test messages are displayed during system initialization. You can
put your own little text there by using the SRM:</p>

hardware revisions and error log counts.</p>

<p>Both Sable, DemiSable and Lynx have Symbios 810 based Fast SCSI on-board. Check if it
is set to Fast SCSI speed by</p>

</pre>

<p>enables Fast SCSI speeds.</p>

<p>AS2100[A] come equipped with a StorageWorks 7 slot SCSI cage. A second cage can be
added inside the cabinet. AS2000 has a single 7 slot SCSI cage, which cannot be expanded
with an additional one. Note that the slot locations in these cages map differently to
SCSI IDs compared to the standard StorageWorks shelves. Slot IDs from top to bottom are
0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3 when using a single bus configuration.</p>

<p>The cage can also be set to provide two independent SCSI buses. This is used for
embedded RAID controllers like the KZPSC (Mylex DAC960). Slot ID assignments for split
bus are, from top to bottom: 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B. Where A and B signify a SCSI
bus. In a single bus configuration the terminator module on the back of the SCSI cage is
on the TOP. The jumper module is on the BOTTOM. For split bus operation these two modules
are reversed. The terminator can be distinguished from the jumper by noting the chips on
the terminator. The jumper does not have any active components on it.</p>

<p>DemiSable has 7 EISA slots and 3 PCI slots. Sable has 8 EISA and 3 PCI slots. Lynx,
being newer, has 8 PCI and 3 EISA slots. The Lynx PCI slots are grouped in sets of 4. The
4 PCI slots closest to the CPU/memory slots are the primary slots, so logically before
the PCI bridge chip. Note that contrary to expectation the primary PCI slots are the
highest numbered ones (PCI4 - PCI7).</p>

<p>Make sure you run the EISA Configuration Utility (from floppy) when adding/change
expansion cards in EISA slots or after upgrading your console firmware. This is done by
inserting the ECU floppy and typing</p>

</div>

<p>A special Extended I/O module for use on the C-bus was planned-for. If they ever saw
daylight is unknown. In any case FreeBSD has never been verified with an ExtIO
module.</p>

<p>The machines can be equipped with redundant power supplies. Note that the enclosure is
equipped with interlock switches that switch off power when the enclosure is opened. The
system's cooling fans are speed controlled. When the machine has more than 2 CPUs and
more than 1 memory board dual power supplies are mandatory.</p>

<h4 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN998" name="AEN998">2.3.12 AlphaServer 4x00
(&#8220;Rawhide&#8221;)</a></h4>

<p>The AlphaServer 4x00 machines are intended as small enterprise servers. Expect a
30&quot; high pedestal cabinet or alternatively the same system box in a 19&quot; rack.
Rawhides are multi-CPU machines, up to 4 CPUs can be in a single machine. Basic disk
storage is housed in one or two StorageWorks shelves at the bottom of the pedestal. The
Rawhides intended for the NT market are designated DIGITAL Server 7300 (5/400 CPU),
DIGITAL Server 7305 (5/533 CPU). A trailing R on the part-number means a rackmount
variant.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>21164 EV5 CPUs at 266, 300, 333 MHz or 21164A EV56 CPUs at 400, 466, 533, 600 Mhz</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>cache: 4 Mbytes per CPU. EV5 300 MHz was also available cache-less. 8 Mbytes for EV56
600Mhz</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>memory bus: 128 bit with ECC</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>embedded floppy controller</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2 serial ports</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>1 parallel port</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PS/2 style keyboard &#38; mouse port</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Rawhide can be equipped with a variety of CPU modules. CPU modules exist in versions
with and without external cache. In all cases the CPU modules installed always must be of
the same speed. A mix of NT-only and full-blown Tru64/VMS CPUs works fine. It will
however result in the system reporting itself to the operating system as a Digital Server
730x (so the NT-only variant). FreeBSD does not care, but such a system will not allow
Tru64 or VMS to run.</p>

<p>Rawhide uses a maximum of 8 RAM modules. These modules are used in pairs and supply 72
bits to the bus (this includes ECC bits). Memory can be EDO RAM or synchronous DRAM. A
fully populated AS4100 has 4 pairs of memory modules. The AS4000 model is limited to 2
pairs of memory modules. Given the choice use SDRAM for best performance. The highest
capacity memory boards must be in the memory slots marked MEM0L and MEM0H. A mix of
memory board sizes is allowed. A mix of EDO and SDRAM works as well (assuming you don't
try to mix EDO and SDRAM in a single module pair). A mix of EDO and SDRAM results in the
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">entire</i></span> memory subsystem running at
the slower EDO timing.</p>

<p>Rawhide has an embedded Symbios 810 chip that gives you a narrow fast-SCSI bus.
Generally only the SCSI CDROM is driven by this interface.</p>

<p>Rawhides are available with a 8 64-bit PCI / 3 EISA slot expansion backplanes (called
&#8220;Saddle&#8221; modules). There are 2 separate PCI buses, PCI0 and PCI1. PCI0 has 1
dedicated PCI slot and (shared) 3 PCI/EISA slots. PCI0 also has a PCI/EISA bridge that
drives things like the serial and parallel ports, keyboard/mouse etc. PCI1 has 4 PCI
slots and a Symbios 810 SCSI chip. VGA console cards must be installed in a slot
connected to PCI0.</p>

<p>The current FreeBSD implementation has problems in handling PCI bridges. There is
currently a limited fix in place which allows for single level, single device PCI
bridges. The fix allows the use of the Digital supplied Qlogic SCSI card which sits
behind a 21054 PCI bridge chip.</p>

</div>

<p>Rawhide employs an I2C based power controller system. If you want to be sure all power
is removed from the system remove all mains cables from the system.</p>

<p>Rawhide comes with RCM functionality, which means you can power it on/off remotely,
reset it etc. See also the description for the RMC in the DS10 section of this document.
RCM versus RMC is not a typo, the various documentation I consulted used both acronyms
interchangeably. Note that if you want remote power on/off to function you need to
connect a small DC adapter to the machine in order to have the RCM logic powered. You
need to supply 9-12V DC to the small inlet located next to the keyboard connector.</p>

<p>AS1200 uses 2 memory daughter cards. On each of these cards are 8 DIMM slots. DIMMs
must be installed in pairs. The maximum memory size is 4 GBytes. Slots must be filled in
order and slot 0 must contain the largest size DIMM if different sized DIMMs are used.
AS1200 employs fixed starting addresses for DIMMs, each DIMM pair starts at a 512 Mbyte
boundary. This means that if DIMMs smaller than 256 Mbyte are used the system's physical
memory map will contain &#8220;holes&#8221;. Supported DIMM sizes are 64 Mbytes and 256
Mbytes. The DIMMs are 72 bit SDRAM based, as the system employs ECC.</p>

</div>

<p>AS1200 has an embedded Symbios 810 drive Fast SCSI bus.</p>

<p>Tincup has 5 64-bit PCI slots, one 1 32-bit PCI slot and one EISA slot (which is
physically shared with one of the 64-bit PCI slots). There are 2 separate PCI buses, PCI0
and PCI1. PCI0 has the 32-bit PCI slot and the 2 top-most 64-bit PCI slots. PCI0 also has
an Intel 82375EB PCI/EISA bridge that drives things like the serial and parallel ports,

</ul>

<p>Slot B is a box-like enclosure that houses a daughter-board for the CPU and cache. It
has 2 small fans for cooling. Loud fans..</p>

<p>The machine needs ECC capable DIMMs, so 72 bit ones. This does not appear to be
documented in the UP1000 docs. The system accesses the serial EEPROM on the DIMMs via the
SM bus. Note that if only a single DIMM is used it must be installed in slot <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">2</i></span>. This is a bit counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>The UP1000 needs a 400Watt ATX power supply according to the manufacturer. This might
be a bit overly conservative/pessimistic judging from the power consumption of the board
&#38; cpu. But as always you will have to take your expansion cards and peripherals into
account. The M1543C chip contains power management functionality &#38; temperature
monitoring (via I2C / SM bus).</p>

<p>Chances are that your UP1000 comes by default with AlphaBios only. The SRM console
firmware is available from the Alpha Processor Inc. web site. It is currently available
in a beta version which was successfully used during the port of FreeBSD to the
UP1000.</p>

<p>The embedded Ultra DMA EIDE ports are bootable by the SRM console.</p>

<p>UP1000 SRM can boot off an Adaptec 294x adapter. Under high I/O load conditions
machine lockups have been observed using the Adaptec 294x. A Symbios 875 based card works
just fine, using the sym driver. Most likely other cards based on the Symbios chips that
the sym driver supports will work as well.</p>

SM bus. Note that if only a single DIMM is used it must be installed in slot <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">2</i></span>. This is a bit counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>The UP1100 needs a 400Watt ATX power supply according to the manufacturer. This might
be a bit overly conservative/pessimistic judging from the power consumption of the board
&#38; cpu. But as always you will have to take your expansion cards and peripherals into
account. The M1535D chip contains power management functionality &#38; temperature
monitoring (via I2C / SM bus using a LM75 thermal sensor).</p>

<p>The UP1100 has an on-board 21143 10/100Mbit Ethernet interface.</p>

<p>The UP1100 is equipped with a SoundBlaster compatible audio interface. Whether it
works with FreeBSD is as of yet unknown.</p>

<p>The embedded Ultra DMA EIDE ports are bootable by the SRM console.</p>

<p>The UP1100 has 3 USB ports, 2 going external and one connected to the AGP port.</p>

<h4 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1205" name="AEN1205">2.3.17 Compaq AlphaServer ES40
(&#8220;Clipper&#8221;)</a></h4>

<p>The ES40 is a SMP system that can have 1 - 4 21264 Alpha CPUs. With the maximum
configuration of 32GB of memory these systems are often deployed as heavy database
servers and are also found in HPTC compute farm environments.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>21264 Alpha CPU at 500 (EV6), 667 (EV67) or 833 MHz (EV68) (max. 4 CPUs)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>memory bus: 256-bit wide</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>21272 Core Logic chipset</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PS/2 mouse &#38; keyboard port</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>memory: 200-pin JEDEC standard SDRAM DIMMS, max 32 GBytes of memory</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2 16550A serial port</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>1 ECP/EPP parallel port</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>ALI M1543C Ultra DMA66 IDE interface</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>expansion: 2 64 bit PCI buses</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SRM console code comes standard with the ES40.</p>

<p>ES40 comes with an ATA CDROM drive, but uses SCSI harddisks. The usual Symbios &#38;
Qlogic adapters are bootable, as is the KZPEA aka Adaptec 39160 dual channel LVD U160
adapter.</p>

<p>Memory is divided in 4 memory arrays which each contain a set of 4 SDRAM DIMMs. Each
DIMM is 72 bit wide and of the 100MHz speed variant. An array can contain 2 sets, so 8
DIMMs max per array. The DIMMs live on Memory Mother Boards (MMBs). There are 2 MMB
models, with 4 and 8 DIMM sockets respectively. Each MMB provides half of the 256 bit
memory bus width to the CPUs. Given the myriad options for the memory configuration it is
advisable to check the system documentation for the optimum memory configuration.</p>

<p>Dependent on the model variation the ES40 has 6 or 10 64 bit PCI slots. This is
basically just means the same backplane with less connectors mounted.</p>

<p>ES40 has the same RMC remote power control as DS10 and DS20. See the description of
the RMC in the DS10 section of this document. Most variations of ES40 have multiple power
supplies, allowing for N+1 redundancy. When installing CPU cards you must unplug all
power cords, the CPU cards receive standby power from the power supplies. Maximum memory
configurations need more than the default number of powersupplies.</p>

<p>The kernel config file must contain:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">

<h3 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1242" name="AEN1242">2.4 Supported Hardware Overview</a></h3>

<p>A word of caution: the installed base for FreeBSD is not nearly as large as for
FreeBSD/Intel. This means that the enormous variation of PCI/ISA expansion cards out
there has much less chance of having been tested on alpha than on Intel. This is not to
imply they are doomed to fail, just that the chance of running into something never
tested before is much higher. <tt class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> contains things that are
known to work on Alpha only.</p>

<p>The PCI and ISA expansion busses are fully supported. Turbo Channel is not in <tt
class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> and has limited support (see the relevant machine model
info). The MCA bus is not supported. The EISA bus is not supported for use with EISA
expansion cards as the EISA support code is lacking. ISA cards in EISA slots are reported
to work. The Compaq Qvision EISA VGA card is driven in ISA mode and works OK as a
console.</p>

<p>1.44 Mbyte and 1.2 Mbyte floppy drives are supported. 2.88 Mbyte drives sometimes
found in Alpha machines are supported up to 1.44Mbyte.</p>

<p>ATA and ATAPI (IDE) devices are supported via the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ata&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+6.2-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ata</span>(4)</span></a> driver
framework. As most people run their Alphas with SCSI disks it is not as well tested as
SCSI. Be aware of boot-ability restrictions for IDE disks. See the machine specific
information.</p>

<p>There is full SCSI support via the CAM layer for Adaptec 2940x (AIC7xxx chip-based),
Qlogic family and Symbios. Those of you interested in U160 SCSI might want to take a look
at an Adaptec 39160 dual channel LVD U160 adapter. Compaq calls this a KZPEA adapter.
Recent Alpha models have SRM versions that can boot from them. In general be aware of the
machine-specific boot-ability issues for the various adapter models. Where known they are
listed in the individual machine descriptions.</p>

<p>The Qlogic QL2x00 FibreChannel host adapters are fully supported.</p>

<p>If you want to boot your Alpha over the Ethernet you will obviously need an Ethernet
card that the SRM console recognizes. This generally means you need a board with an 21x4x
Ethernet chip as that is what Digital used. These chips are driven by the FreeBSD <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=de&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+6.2-RELEASE"><span

 class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">dc</span>(4)</span></a> (newer driver).
Some new SRM versions are known to recognize the Intel 8255x Ethernet chips as driven by
the FreeBSD <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fxp&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+6.2-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fxp</span>(4)</span></a> driver.
But beware: the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fxp&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+6.2-RELEASE">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fxp</span>(4)</span></a> driver is
reported not to work correctly with FreeBSD/alpha (although it works excellently on
FreeBSD/x86).</p>

<p>In general the SRM console emulates a VGA-compatibility mode on PCI VGA cards. This
is, however, not guaranteed to work by Compaq/DEC for each and every card type out there.
When the SRM thinks the VGA is acceptable FreeBSD will be able to use it. The console
driver works just like on a FreeBSD/intel machine. Please note that VESA modes are not
supported on Alpha, so that leaves you with 80x25 consoles.</p>

<p>In some Alpha machines you will find video adapters based on TGA chips. TGA support in
FreeBSD is not as robust as it should be. In case of problems it is advisable to try
either a serial console or a plain VGA card.</p>

<p>The &#8220;PC standard&#8221; serial ports found on most Alphas are supported.</p>

<p>ISDN (i4b) is not supported on FreeBSD/alpha.</p>

1. What's new since 4.1-RELEASE
--------------------------------------
Changes which were also present in the 4.1.1 point release will be
marked [4.1.1].

1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------
The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged
configurations, has been added. [4.1.1]

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added. [4.1.1]

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed. [4.1.1]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers. [4.1.1]

The ata(4) driver now has support for tagged queueing, which is
enabled by the ATA_ENABLE_TAGS option.  It also supports the
ServerWorks ROSB4 ATA33 chipset, the CMD 648 ATA66 and CMD 649 ATA100
chipsets, and the Cyrix 5530.  It also has support for ATA "pseudo"
RAID controllers, including the Promise Fasttrak and HighPoint HPT370
controllers.

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit Ethernet cards. [4.1.1]

The ng_bridge(4) node type has been added to the netgraph subsystem.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made. [4.1.1]

Support for Fujitsu MB86960A/MB86965A based Ethernet PC-Cards is back.
[4.1.1]

The asr(4) driver, which provides support for the Adaptec SCSI RAID
controller family, as well as the DPT SmartRAID V and VI families, has
been added. [4.1.1]

The i386 boot loader now has support for a "nullconsole" console type,
for use on systems with neither a video console nor a serial
port. [4.1.1]

The pcn(4) driver, which supports the AMD PCnet/FAST, PCnet/FAST+,
PCnet/FAST III, PCnet/PRO, PCnet/Home, and HomePNA adapters, has been
added.  Although these cards are already supported by the lnc(4)
driver, the pcn driver runs these chips in 32-bit mode and uses the RX
alignment feature to achieve zero-copy receive.  This driver is also
machine-independent, so it will work on both the i386 and alpha
platforms.  The lnc driver is still needed to support non-PCI cards.

The pcm(4) driver now supports the ESS Solo 1, Maestro-1, Maestro-2,
and Maestro-2e; Forte Media fm801, ESS Maestro-2e, and VIA Technologies
VT82C686A sound card/chipsets, and has received some other updates.

Replace the PQ_*CACHE options with a single PQ_CACHESIZE option to be
set to the cache size in kilobytes.  The old options are still
supported for backwards compatibility.

The NCPU, NAPIC, NBUS, and NINTR kernel configuration options,
for configuring SMP kernels, have been removed.  NCPU is now set to a 
maximum of 16, and the other, aforementioned options are now dynamic.

The ahc(4) driver has been updated.

The amr(4) driver has been updated with support for new AMI
MegaRAID models.

The snc(4) driver for the National Semiconductor DP8393X (SONIC)
Ethernet controller.  Curently, this driver is only used on the PC-98
architecture.

The ich(4) driver for the Intel 82801AA (ICH) SMBus controller and
compatibles has been added.

bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.15.  New tuner types have been
added, and improvememts to the KLD module and to memory allocation
have been made. [4.1.1]  This driver subsequently was updated to 2.17,
which fixes bugs in devfs when unloading and reloading, and syncs with
some NetBSD changes.

Default the PC Card Interface Controller(pcic) to polling mode(irq 0).

The ncv(4), nsp(4), and stg(4) drivers have been ported from
NetBSD/pc98.  They supports NCR 53C50 / Workbit Ninja SCSI-3 / TMC
18C30, 18C50 based PC-Card/ISA SCSI controllers.

The mly(4) driver, for Mylex PCI to SCSI AccelRAID and eXtremeRAID
controllers with firmware 6.x and later, has been added.

The twe(4) driver for 3ware controllers has been updated, with
improved queueing, error handling and reporting, and user interface
for the 3ware-supplied '3dm' monitoring tool.

The uscanner(4) driver, which provides basic USB scanner support using
SANE, has been added.  (See the SANE home page for supported
scanners.)  The HP ScanJet 4100C, 5200C and 6300C are known to be
working.

The umodem(4) driver for USB modems has been added; it currently
supports the 3Com 5605 USB modem.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

sysinstall(8) now allows the user to select one of three "security
profiles" at install-time.  These profiles enable different levels of
system security by enabling or disabling various system services in
rc.conf(5) on new installs. [4.1.1]

Many string-handling library calls were fixed to reduce the
possibility of buffer overflow-related exploits.

A security hole in Linux emulation was fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:42).  [4.1.1]

TCP now uses stronger randomness in choosing its initial sequence 
numbers (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:52).

A bug in finger(1) that could allow remote users to view
world-readable files has been closed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:54).

rlogind(8), rshd(8), and fingerd(8) are now disabled by default in
/etc/inetd.conf.  This change only affects new installations.

Several buffer overflows in tcpdump(1) were corrected (see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:61).

A security hole in top(1) was corrected (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:62).

A potential security hole caused by an off-by-one-error in
gethostbyname(3) has been fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:63).

A potential buffer overflow in the ncurses(3X) library, which could
cause arbitrary code to be run from within systat(1), has been corrected
(see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:68).

A vulnerability in telnetd(8) that could cause it to consume large
amounts of server resources has been fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:69).

The "nat deny_incoming" command in ppp(8) now works correctly (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:70).


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer required for
USA residents. [4.1.1]
 
sshd is now enabled by default on new installs. [4.1.1]
 
Version numbers of installed packages have a new (backward-compatible)
syntax, which supports the "PORTREVISION" and "PORTEPOCH" variables in
ports collection makefiles.  These changes help keep track of changes
in the ports collection entries such as security patches or
FreeBSD-specific updates, which aren't reflected in the original,
third-party software distributions.  pkg_version(1) can now compare
these new-style version numbers. [4.1.1]

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.1.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README);
newaliases is limited to root and trusted users; STARTTLS encryption; and
the MSA port (587) is turned on by default.  See
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more information.

mail.local(8) is no longer installed as a set-user-id binary.  If you
are using a /etc/mail/sendmail.cf from the default sendmail.cf
included with FreeBSD any time after 3.1.0, you are fine.  If you are
using a hand-configured sendmail.cf and mail.local for delivery, check
to make sure the F=S flag is set on the Mlocal line.  Those with .mc
files who need to add the flag can do so by adding the following line
to their your .mc file and regenerating the sendmail.cf file:
    MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+S')dnl
Note that FEATURE(`local_lmtp') already does this.

The default /etc/mail/sendmail.cf disables the SMTP EXPN and VRFY commands.

vacation(1) has been updated to use the version included with
sendmail.

The sendmail(8) configuration building tools are installed in
/usr/share/sendmail/cf/.

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.2.0.  ssh-add(1) and ssh-agent(1) can
now handle DSA keys.  An sftp server interoperable with ssh.com
clients and others has been added.  scp(1) can now handle files >2GB.
Interoperability with other ssh2 clients/servers has been improved.  A
new feature to limit the number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh
connections in sshd has been added.

The compiler chain now uses the FSF-supplied C/C++ runtime
initialization code.  This change brings about better compatibility
with code generated from the various egcs and gcc ports, as well as
the stock public FSF source.

cvs(1) has been updated to 1.11.

The threads library has gained some signal handling changes, bug
fixes, and performance enhancements (including zero system call thread
switching).  gdb(1) thread support has been updated to match these
changes.

GDB now supports hardware watchpoints. [4.1.1]

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22. [4.1.1]

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length of
files, has been added. [4.1.1]

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request. [4.1.1]

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added.
[4.1.1]

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by
/etc/defaults/periodic.conf and /etc/periodic.conf. [4.1.1]
 
logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog. [4.1.1]
 
OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.5a, which includes numerous bugfixes
and enhancements. [4.1.1]
 
finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file. [4.1.1]
 
The xl(4) driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B MiniPCI
adapters used on some laptops. [4.1.1]
 
killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1). [4.1.1]

boot98cfg(8), a PC-98 boot manager installation and configuration
utility, has been added. [4.1.1]

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an
interface.  [4.1.1]

setproctitle(3) has been moved from libutil to libc. [4.1.1]

sed(1) now takes a -E option for extended regular expression
support. [4.1.1]

ln(1) now takes an -i option to request user configuration before
overwriting an existing file. [4.1.1]

tcpdump(1) has received some updates and bugfixes.

User-land ppp(8) has received a number of updates and bugfixes.

The internal procedure for building perl has changed, and no longer
depends on (nor installs) miniperl.  Users upgrading from source
should delete /usr/bin/miniperl.

To improve performance and disk utilization, the "ports skeletons" in
the FreeBSD Ports Collection have been restructured.  Installed ports
and packages should not be affected.

ncurses has been updated to ncurses-5.1-20001009.

make(1) has gained the :C/// (regexp substitution), :L (lowercase),
and :U (uppercase) variable modifiers.  These were added to reduce the
differences between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD/NetBSD make programs.

The "in use" percentage metric displayed by netstat(1) now really
reflects the percentage of network mbufs used.

chio(1) now has the ability to specify elements by volume tag instead
of by their physical location as well as the ability to return an
element to its previous location.

The ISC library from the BIND distribution is now built as libisc.

IP Filter is now supported by the rc.conf(5) boot-time configuration
and initialization.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        BSDi
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite F
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@osd.bsdi.com or http://www.freebsdmall.com.

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -stable development efforts, you should
definitely join the -stable mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!

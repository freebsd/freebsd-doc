<p>The FreeBSD Project is looking forward to participating as a mentoring
  organization in <a
  href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google
  Summer of Code</a> 2018.
  This program offers students a stipend of <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends">up
    to $6,600 USD</a> to contribute to an open source project over
the summer break.
We have had over 210 successful
students working on FreeBSD as part of this program since 2005.</p>

<p>This page and the ideas lists will be updated throughout the application period
to include new information, such as project ideas, proposal information,
and potential mentor contact information.  If you don't see an idea that
interests you, visit again in a couple of days!  Additionally, we welcome
proposals unrelated to the ideas listed here.</p>

<h2>Benefit of Participating</h2>

<p>Google Summer of Code is an exciting opportunity for students to
  "intern" with an open source project for a summer.  The FreeBSD
  Project, as one of the most successful and oldest open source projects,
  is an excellent place to do this internship.  Founded in 1993, the
  project now consists of several hundred "committers" and tens of
  thousands of contributors.  FreeBSD is the foundation for many
  commercial products, including Apple's Mac OS X, NetApp's OnTap/GX,
  Juniper's JunOS, as well countless other products, and is widely used
  in the Internet Service Provider and corporate IT worlds.  Many of
  these sponsors participate daily in the FreeBSD community, and students
  have the opportunity to develop software ideas in an exciting
  environment with many real world applications, and under the mentorship
  of experienced developers.</p>

<p>After the summer ends, students can be sponsored by Google or
  the FreeBSD Foundation to attend operating systems and open source
  conferences to present on their work, and a significant number go on to
  become FreeBSD developers.  It's also a great job networking
  opportunity!</p>

<a name="ideas"></a>
<h2>Example Proposal Ideas</h2>

  <p>The FreeBSD Project maintains a <a
      href="https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas">list of possible ideas</a>
    on our wiki.
    All projects listed are believed to be sized for a
    useful summer hacking, and have technical contacts who can help answer
    questions as you write your proposal.
    We also maintain a more generic <a
      href="https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/IdeasPage">Ideas Page</a>.  These projects
    are less suitable as Summer of Code projects as they may be
    scoped larger or smaller than a summer, or might not have such a clear
    mentor &mdash; we suggest e-mailing our soc-admins alias for help if you do
    decide to propose one of them.
    These pages exist to help provide inspiration.  Students are also welcome,
    and are indeed encouraged to propose your own ideas, and if the proposal is
    strong, we'll try to match you with a mentor!</p>

    FreeBSD, take a look at recent <a

<a name="proposals"></a>
<h2>Proposal Guidelines</h2>

<p>Students are responsible for writing a proposal and submitting it
  to Google before the application deadline.  The following outline
  was adapted from the Perl Foundation.
  The objective of the proposal is to identify
  what is to be done, explain why this needs to be done, and convince us
  that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You are qualified to do this project. This means both having the
      necessary background and demonstrating a general understanding of the
      problem.</li>
    <li>You have the resources (especially time!) needed to complete the
      project within the working period of the Summer of Code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A strong proposal will include (at least):</p>

  <h3>General Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Name</strong></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Email</strong></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Phone</strong></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>IM/IRC</strong></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Availability</strong></p>

      <p>How many hours per week will you spend working on this? How many on
	other things? What other obligations (work, school, vacation,
	weddings, etc.) do you have this summer? Be as specific as possible:
	when will the project begin and end?  You should be ready to produce
	a day by day schedule before the program starts.)</p>

      <p><strong>Please note</strong>: participating in Google Summer of Code
	is a significant time commitment, and you should not apply if you
	already have another full-time job planned for the summer.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Biography</strong></p>

      <p>Who are you? What skills do you bring to this project? What is your
	past involvement with The FreeBSD Project?  (Past involvement is not
	required, but ideally you will have at least installed FreeBSD and
	perhaps fixed a bug or two)  If your project includes programming in
	a particular language, such as C, or in a specific environment, such
	as the kernel or an embedded platform, what experience do you have
	working in that area?  Are you familiar with or a user of revision
	control systems?  Have you completed courses that will be relevant to
	your project idea?  What do you think you will need to learn to
	complete this project?</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Possible Mentor</strong></p>

      <p>Optional, but highly recommended. Do not put a name here if you have
	not contacted them.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Project Title</strong></p>

      <p>In forty characters or less, what you propose to do.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>

      <p>A few paragraphs describing your project.  Direct copies from the
	ideas page will be rejected - proposals should reveal that you have
	done some research into the problem and its solutions.  Include both
	what you will be doing and why it is a good thing for The FreeBSD
	Project.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>

      <p>A list quantifiable results and related code milestones. We suggest
	at least two milestones before the mid-term evaluations and two
	after.  Where appropriate, this schedule should include multiple
	committable or releasable points so people can benefit from and/or
	test your work as early as possible.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Test Plan</strong></p>

      <p>What parts of your code need testing and how do you plan to test
	them?  This might include both functionality and performance tests.
	</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Project Schedule</strong></p>

      <p>How long will the project take? When can you begin work?</p></li>

  </ul>

<a name="mentors"></a>
<h2>Mentors</h2>

<p>A number of FreeBSD committers are willing to mentor students.  A
  good place to start is the 'Technical contacts' listed with the
  example projects on the <a
  href="https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas">ideas page</a>.</p>

<a name="infrastructure"></a>
<h2>Infrastructure Provided to Students</h2>

<p>In previous years, the FreeBSD Project provided access to FreeBSD
  Subversion and
  Perforce revision control infrastructure in order to facilitate
  student collaboration, provide public access and archiving for the
  on-going student projects, and to help mentors and the community
  monitor on-going work.  It is expected that students participating
  in future programs will be offered the same facilities.  Students
  will also be asked to maintain wiki pages on their on-going
  projects.  In the past, e-mail, IRC, and instant messaging have
  proven popular among students and mentors, and students
  participating in the FreeBSD summer program are encouraged to use
  these and other electronic communication mechanisms to become active
  in the community.</p>

<a name="faq"></a>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>When are proposals due, and how do I submit mine?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>At the time of writing, Google has announced the following dates of
      interest relating to the application process:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>12 March</strong> - Student application period opens.
	</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>27 March 18:00 UTC</strong> - Student application period closes.
	</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>23 April</strong> - Accepted students announced, students
	start creating their work plans.  Community bonding period starts.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>14 May</strong> - Coding starts.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>6 August</strong> - Suggested end of coding.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that these dates may change, and the Google FAQ timeline is the
      authoritative source of detailed schedule information:</p>

    <ul><li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">
      GSoC Timeline</a></li></ul>

    <p>All students must register with, and submit applications via, the
      Google Summer of Code home page:</p>

    <ul><li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google
      Summer of Code Home Page</a></li></ul></li>

  <li><p><strong>What advice do you have for a student who might want to
    submit a proposal?</strong></p>

    <p>Experience suggests that the strongest proposals come from students
      who contact FreeBSD developers and potential mentors well in advance
      of submitting their proposal, seek feedback on their proposal ideas,
      and write proposals that reflect time spent exploring and understanding
      the problem area to be addressed.  Even if the FreeBSD developer(s) you
      contact aren't the eventual mentor of the project, their feedback can
      be invaluable.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Can I submit multiple project proposals to the FreeBSD
    Project?</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, but do make sure you invest adequate time in each proposal.  We
      are not able to accept more than one project per student, so you may do
      better spending more time on one or two detailed proposals than by
      submitting lots of less-detailed ones.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Will the FreeBSD Project accept more than one student for
    the same idea?</strong></p>

    <p>In general, we will accept only one student for any given proposal
      idea, as most proposal ideas in our ideas list are sized with a single
      student summer project in mind.  This is a good reason to consider
      coming up with your own idea, or at least, making sure that your
      proposal for one of our project ideas reflects your unique contribution
      and viewpoint.  If you plan to submit multiple proposals, you might
      consider doing one with an idea from the list, and another with an
      original idea.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>What if my proposal is not selected in the application
    process?  Can I still participate?</strong></p>

    <p>We always have more good applications than student places, but that
      doesn't mean you can't do the project anyway.  The FreeBSD Project
      always welcomes new volunteers to work on projects, and is generally
      happy to provide mentoring and support for students whose proposals
      could not be selected in order to allow them to work on their project
      anyway.  You will need to work with the FreeBSD Project GSoC
      administrators to identify a possible mentor.  However, Google will not
      fund that participation.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>What projects were completed successfully by students
    in previous summers?</strong></p>

    <p>Please see the <a
      href="https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2017Projects">2017 FreeBSD
      Summer of Code page</a>,  as well as older project pages from

      href="summerofcode-2005.html">2005</a> for a list of the
      completed projects from previous years.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>How can I learn more about FreeBSD?</strong></p>

    <p>The <a href="//www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD Project Home Page</a>
      is the best way to learn more about the project &mdash; from there you can
      reach the FreeBSD Handbook, FreeBSD Developer's Handbook, project
      mailing list archives, regular project status reports, and more.  If
      you have questions about specific project ideas, e-mail the technical
      contacts for those ideas.  If you have general GSoC questions relating
      to FreeBSD, such as if you are unable to reach a project technical
      contact, need help finding documentation, or want to know who might be
      a good person to talk to about your idea, send them to <a
      href="mailto:soc-admins@FreeBSD.org">soc-admins@FreeBSD.org</a>.</p>
      </li>

  <li><p><strong>Is there an IRC channel I can join to talk about proposal
    ideas or get help finding out more?</strong></p>

    <p>You can join #freebsd-soc on the efnet IRC network to chat with
      FreeBSD developers interested in mentoring student proposals and
      projects, past FreeBSD/GSoC students, and other students applying to
      FreeBSD/GSoC this year.</p></li>

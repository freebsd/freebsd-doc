<p>In addition to the mainstream development path of FreeBSD, a number
of developer groups are working on the cutting edge to expand
FreeBSD's range of applications in new directions.  Follow the links
below to learn more about these exciting projects.</p>

If you feel that a project is missing, please send the URL and a short
description (3-10 lines) to
<a href="../mailto.html">www@FreeBSD.org</a>.

<p>In addition, some of these projects regularly submit status reports,
which can be viewed on the <a href="../news/status/status.html">status

In August 2001 a standard of syslog was made: RFC3164. This RFC
describes some extensions to add security to syslog. A project
started in 2002 to adapt RFC3164 to the FreeBSD version of syslog and to add
some security extensions, at least syslog-sign. Both libc and syslogd will
be modified.  And optionally some tools to verify or manage the security
would be made.
All help is welcome. Send an email to albert@ons-huis.net for info.</li>

Other planned and implemented things are all the normal management
tools and a server.</li>

<li><a name="Tertiary" href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Td/">Tertiary Disk</a>:
A storage system architecture to create large disk storage systems
that avoid the disadvantages of custom built disk arrays. The
name comes from twin goals: to have the cost per megabyte and
capacity of tape libraries and the performance of magnetic
disks. We use commodity, off the shelf components to develop a
scalable, low cost, terabyte capacity disk system. Our target is
to build a complete storage system with about 30-50% extra to
the cost of the raw disk.  Tertiary Disk uses PCs connected by a
switched network to host a large number of disks. Our prototype
consists of 20 200MHz PC PCs, which host 370 8GB disks. The PCs
are connected through a 100Mbps Ethernet switch.</li>

<li><a name="vinum" href="http://www.vinumvm.org/">Vinum</a>:
A logical volume manager modeled after the VERITAS volume manager&trade;.
However, it is not a clone of Veritas, and attempts to solve a
number of problems more elegantly than Veritas.  It also offers
features that Veritas does not have.</li>

<a name="devicedrivers"></a>
<h3>Device drivers</h3>
<ul>

<li><a name="busdma" href="&base;/projects/busdma/index.html">busdma
and SMPng driver conversion</a>: busdma provides a portable abstraction
to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) hardware primitives used by many high
performance device drivers.  By using this abstraction, device driver
authors avoid adding platform-specific DMA management code, improving
the portability of drivers between hardware architectures.  This page
also tracks the progress of drivers towards being SMPng-safe.</li>

A New Device Framework for FreeBSD</a></li>

<li><a name="atm" href="http://chuck.cranor.org/p/bsdatm.pdf"> BSD ATM: implementation of ATM internetworking under 4.4BSD</a>:
New computer applications in areas such as multimedia, imaging,
and distributed computing demand high levels of performance from
computer networks. ATM-based networking solutions provide one
possible alternative to meeting these performance needs.
However, the complexity of ATM over traditional networks such as
Ethernet has proven to be a barrier to its being used. In this
paper we present the design and implementation of BSD ATM, a
light-weight and efficient ATM software layer for BSD-based
operating systems that requires minimal changes to the operating
system. BSD ATM can be used both for IP-based networking traffic
and for ``native'' ATM traffic.</li>

Porting FreeBSD to IA-64 systems</a>:
This project is responsible for porting FreeBSD to the IA-64
architecture. Direct any questions specific to this project to the
freebsd-ia64@FreeBSD.org mailing list. </li>

<li><a name="ppc" href="../platforms/ppc.html">Porting FreeBSD to PowerPC&reg; systems</a>:

information and so on.</li>

<li><a name="sparc" href="../platforms/sparc.html">Porting FreeBSD to SPARC&reg; systems</a>:

<li><a name="sysvr4" href="http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/freebsd-svr4/">
SysVR4 Emulation</a>: This page describes an SysVR4 emulator for
FreeBSD. It is currently capable of running (or walking, in some
cases) a wide-ish variety of SysV executables taken from Solaris&trade;/x86
2.5.1 and 2.6 systems. I have reason to believe that it will also run
SCO UnixWare and SCO OpenServer binaries.</li>

<li><a name="oskit" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">The OSKit</a>:
The OSKit is a framework and a set of 31 component libraries oriented
to operating systems, together with extensive documentation. By
providing in a modular way not only most of the infrastructure
"grunge" needed by an OS, but also many higher-level components, the
OSKit's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to
lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS,
port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other
architectures supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a
wider range of devices, filesystem formats, executable formats, or
network services. The OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related
programs, such as boot loaders or OS-level servers atop a
microkernel.</li>

        building, distributing, fetching, and applying binary security
        updates for FreeBSD. This makes it possible to easily track
        the FreeBSD security branches without the need for fetching
        the source tree and recompiling (except on the machine
        building the updates, of course). Updates are
        cryptographically signed; they are also distributed as binary
        diffs using a binary diff tool, which dramatically reduces
        the bandwidth used.</li>

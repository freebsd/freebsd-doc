    <h2><a>Learning about &os;</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The <a href="&url.books;/handbook/index.html">&os;
	Handbook</a> and <a
	href="&url.books;/faq/index.html">Frequently Asked Questions

	they contain a lot of material for newbies as well as advanced
	users.  For users interested in installing a GUI, see the <a
	href="&url.books;/handbook/x11.html">X Windows</a> chapter.
	</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="&cgibase;/man.cgi">Manual pages</a> are good for
	reference but not always the best introduction for a novice.
	They generally provide information on a specific command,
	driver or service.</p></li>

    </ul>

    <h2><a>Questions and Support</a></h2>

    </ul>

    <h2><a>Learning about &os;-derived projects</a></h2>

    <p>&os; is widely used as a building block for other commercial
      and open-source operating systems.  Some of the most widely used
      and publicly available systems are listed below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="http://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> is a storage
	solution that can be installed on virtually any hardware
	platform to share data over a network.  It uses ZFS to protect,
	store, backup, all of your data.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="https://www.trueos.org">TrueOS</a> is a &os;
	derivative with a graphical installer and impressive desktop
	tools aimed at ease of use for the casual computer
	user.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a> is a &os;
	based network security solution.  pfSense
	software, with the help of the package system, is able to
	provide the same functionality or more of common commercial
	firewalls, without any of the artificial limitations.  It has
	successfully replaced every big name commercial firewall you can
	imagine in numerous installations around the world.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a>How to Contribute</a></h2>

    <p>Everyone has something to contribute to the &os; community,
      even newbies! Some are busy working with the new advocacy group
      and some have become involved with the <a
	href="&base;/docproj/docproj.html">Documentation Project</a> as
      reviewers.  Other &os; newbies might have particular skills and
      experiences to share, either computer related or not, or just
      want to meet new newbies and make them feel welcome. There are
      always people around who help others simply because they like
      to.</p>

    <p>Friends who run &os; are a great resource. No book can replace
      chatting on the phone or across a pizza with someone who has the
      same interests, enjoys similar accomplishments, and faces the
      same challenges. If you do not have many friends who use &os;,
      consider using your old &os; CDs to create some more.</p>

    <p><a href="&base;/usergroups.html">User groups</a> are good
      places to meet other &os; users. If there is no one nearby, you
      might consider starting one!</p>

    <p>For more information on getting involved in the community, see

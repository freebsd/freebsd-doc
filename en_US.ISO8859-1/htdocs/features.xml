    <h1>&os; offers many unique features.</h1>

    <p>No matter what the application, an operating system should take
    advantage of every resource available.  &os;'s focus on
    performance, networking, and storage combines with ease of system
    administration and comprehensive documentation to realize the full
    potential of any computer.</p>

    <h2>A complete operating system based on 4.4BSD.</h2>

      <p>&os;'s distinguished roots derive from the <b>BSD</b>
	software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at
	the University of California, Berkeley.  Over twenty years of
	work have been put into enhancing &os;, adding
	industry-leading scalability, network performance, management
	tools, file systems, and security features.  As a result,
	&os; may be found across the Internet, in the operating system
	of core router products, running root name servers, hosting
	major web sites, and as the foundation for widely used desktop
	operating systems.  This is only possible because of the
	diverse and world-wide membership of the
	volunteer &os; Project.</p>

      <p><b>&os;&nbsp;9.0</b>, brings many new features
	and performance enhancements with a special focus on desktop
	support and security features.</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>Capsicum Capability Mode</b>:
	  Capsicum is a set of features for sandboxing support, using
	  a capability model in which the capabilities are file
	  descriptors.  Two new kernel options CAPABILITIES and
	  CAPABILITY_MODE have been added to the GENERIC kernel.</li>

	<li><b>Hhook</b>:  (Helper Hook) and khelp(9) (Kernel Helpers)
	  KPIs have been implemented.  These are a superset of
	  pfil(9) framework for more general use in the kernel.  The
	  hhook(9) KPI provides a way for kernel subsystems to export
	  hook points that khelp(9) modules can hook to provide
	  enhanced or new functionality to the kernel.  The khelp(9)
	  KPI provides a framework for managing khelp(9) modules,
	  which indirectly use the hhook(9) KPI to register their hook
	  functions with hook points of interest within the kernel.
	  These allow a structured way to dynamically extend the
	  kernel at runtime in an ABI preserving manner.</li>

	<li><b>Accounting API:</b> has been implemented.  It can keep
	  per-process, per-jail, and per-login class resource
	  accounting information.  Note that this is neither built nor
	  installed by default.  To build and install this, specify
	  the option RACCT in the kernel configuration file and rebuild
	  the base system as described in the &os; Handbook.</li>

	<li><b>Resource-limiting API:</b> has been implemented.
	  It works in conjunction with the RACCT resource accounting
	  implementation and takes user-configurable actions based on
	  the set of rules it maintains and the current resource
	  usage.  The rctl(8) utility has been added to manage the
	  rules in userland.  Note that this is neither  built nor
	  installed by default.</li>

	<li><b>USB:</b> subsystem now supports USB packet filter.
	  This allows capturing packets which go through each USB
	  host.  The architecture of the packet filter is similar to that of
	  bpf.  The userland program usbdump(8) has been
	  added.</li>

	<li><b>Infiniband support:</b>, OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise
	  Distribution) version 1.5.3 has been imported into the
	  base system.</li>

	<li><b>TCP/IP network:</b> stack now supports the mod_cc(9)
	  pluggable congestion control framework.  This allows TCP
	  congestion control algorithms to be implemented as
	  dynamically loadable kernel modules.  Many kernel
	  modules are available: cc_chd(4) for the CAIA-Hamilton-Delay
	  algorithm, cc_cubic(4) for the CUBIC algorithm, cc_hd(4)
	  for the Hamilton-Delay algorithm, cc_htcp(4) for the H-TCP
	  algorithm, cc_newreno(4) for the NewReno algorithm, and
	  cc_vegas(4) for the Vegas algorithm.  The default algorithm
	  can be set by a new sysctl(8) variable
	  net.inet.tcp.cc.algorithm.</li>

	<li><b>SU+J:</b> &os;'s Fast File System now supports soft
	  updates with journaling.  It introduces an intent log into
	  a softupdates-enabled file system which eliminates the need
	  for background fsck(8) even on unclean shutdowns.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>&os;&nbsp;8.X</b> brought many new
	features and performance enhancements.  With special focus on
	a new USB stack, &os;&nbsp;8.X also shipped with experimental support
	for NFSv4.  A new TTY layer was introduced, which improves
	scalability and resources handling in SMP enabled systems.</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>Netisr framework:</b> has been reimplemented for
	  parallel threading support.  This is a kernel network
	  dispatch interface which allows device drivers (and other
	  packet sources) to direct packets to protocols for directly
	  dispatched or deferred processing.  The new implementation
	  supports up to one netisr thread per CPU, and several
	  benchmarks on SMP machines show substantial performance
	  improvement over the previous version.</li>

	<li><b>Jail improvements:</b> Jails now support multiple IPv4
	  and IPv6 addresses per jail, and also support SCTP.
	  Hierarchies of jails (jails-within-jails) are now supported,
	  and jails can now be restricted to subsets of available
	  CPUs.</li>

	<li><b>Linux emulation:</b> layer has been updated to version
	  2.6.16 and the default Linux infrastructure port is now
	  emulators/linux_base-f10 (Fedora 10).</li>

	<li><b>Network Virtualization:</b> A container ("vimage") has
	  been implemented, extending the &os; kernel to maintain
	  multiple independent instances of networking state.
	  Vimage facilities can be used independently to create fully
	  virtualized network topologies, and jail(8) can directly
	  take advantage of a fully virtualized network stack.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The project is a fairly loosely knit group of people, and the only thing
      we have in common is that we are subscribed to the mailing list
      <a href="mailto:FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Some of us can commit changes directly to the FreeBSD
      documentation tree.  There is a complete list of <a
        href="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html">
        all FreeBSD developers with commit privileges</a>, as well as a
      list of the <a
        href="../administration.html#t-doceng">
        principal committers for the FreeBSD Documentation Project</a>.</p>

    <p>Others do not have commit privileges, but write and submit
      documentation nonetheless.  Once the documentation has been
      submitted according to the <a href="submitting.html">Submit
      Documentation</a> page, one of the committers will then
      review it and include it in the documentation set.</p>

    <p>To help with the documentation project (and we fervently
      hope you do), just subscribe to the mailing list and
      participate. As soon as you have done that, you're a member of the
      project.</p>

<p>When installing Java on FreeBSD you have the choice between
different Java Development Kits:</p>
</td>

<h3><a name="openjdk">OpenJDK on FreeBSD</a></h3>

<p>This is a native port of OpenJDK to FreeBSD.</p>

<p><code>cd /usr/ports/java/openjdk6
<BR>make install clean
</code></p>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<h3><a name="jdk">Oracle JDK on FreeBSD</a></h3>

<p>This is the effort of the Java FreeBSD porting project.
By the use of patchsets and the JDK source code released by Oracle,
this port builds a native JDK for FreeBSD.</p>

<p><code>cd /usr/ports/java/jdk16
<BR>make install clean
</code></p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><a name="linux-sun-jdk">Oracle JDK for Linux</a></h3>

<p>This port installs the Java Development Kit from Oracle which was built for Linux. It will run under FreeBSD using the Linux compatibility.</p>

<p><code>cd /usr/ports/java/linux-sun-jdk16
<BR>make install clean
</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p><b>Note:</b> Please note that due to the current licensing policy the
Oracle JDK on FreeBSD binaries can not be distributed and you are only
permitted to use them personally.  Due to the same reasons you have to
manually fetch the source code and patchset for FreeBSD.</p>

<P>If you should have trouble, you can see the <A HREF="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">
FreeBSD Handbook section on &quot;installing applications&quot;</A> for
help.</P>

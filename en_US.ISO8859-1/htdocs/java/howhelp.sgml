<p><b><font color="#660000">So you want to help, do you?</font></b></p>
<p>Working on the &jdk; port requires a firm grasp of C, the FreeBSD architecture, and a lot of time to spare.  The changes that need to be made in the code have to do with how FreeBSD differs from Solaris&trade;, so if you don't know these, you will not go very far in the port.  We have
had many people say they are willing to help, but when they see what is involved, they drop away.</p>
<p>Having been dutifully warned, here is what you need to do to get involved:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Obtain a license from Sun for the source code</b></li>
<li><ul>
<li><b>For JDK 1.1.x</b> You will need to obtain a &quot;Non-Commercial License&quot;  This is done at <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/nav/business/source_form.html">http://www.javasoft.com/nav/business/source_form.html</a></li>
<li><b>For Java 2</b> You will need to agree to and sign the &quot;Community Source License&quot;  This is done at <a href="http://jsecom4.sun.com:80/servlet/EComActionServlet/ECom.WelcomePageInfo;$sessionid$">the Sun Download Center</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Download the source code</b></li>
<li><ul>
<li><b>For JDK 1.1.x</b> Instructions will be provided to you by Sun.</li>
<li><b>For Java 2</b> You may download the source code from <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/java2/download.html">http://www.sun.com/software/java2/download.html</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Use Patches</b> Patches and build instructions may be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-latest.tar.gz">http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsd-jdk122-patches-latest.tar.gz</a>. Currently open
issues and test results may be found at
<a href="http://www.kjkoster.org/java/index.html">http://kjkoster.org/java/index.html</a>
<h3>AND/OR</h3></li>
<li><b>Obtain source code &quot;diffs&quot;</b> Notify Nate Williams <a href="mailto:nate@yogotech.com">nate@yogotech.com</a> that you have the license and arrange to gain access to the CVS tree.
<h3>AND/OR</h3></li>
<li><b>Begin hacking on the sources</b> Begin your porting. Jump right in and start digging.</li>
<li><b>Let the world know you have finished it!</b></li>
</ol>

<a name="testing"></a>
<p><b><font color="#660000">You want to help, but do not know C or FreeBSD <i>that</i> well?</font></b></p>
<p>The absolute best thing you can do is download the <a href="dists/">latest release</a>, install it, and try all your favorite Java applications.  If they don't work, see below.</p>

<a name="BUG"></a>
<p><b><font color="#660000">I have a bug!</font></b></p>
<p>If you find an application that does not work, or crashes, here are the steps you should follow before reporting it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try it again.</li>
<li>Check your settings for this application.  Check to see if you made a mistake in starting it up.</li>
<li>Try it on a different platform.  If you have access to a reference platform, try it there.  (We need to determine if it is an application error, a Java bug, or a FreeBSD specific bug.)</li>
<li>Narrow down the problem.  If it is your own code, narrow down the bug to the offending code.  Otherwise, determine the steps required to reproduce the problem.</li>
<li>Notify the JDK porting team.  Send email to <a href="mailto:freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org</a>.  Be sure to include the steps you have followed.</li>
<li>Finally, and most importantly, be willing to work with the team to fix the problem.</li>
</ol>

<a name="documentation"></a>
<p><b><font color="#660000">I can help with the web site or documentation!</font></b></p>
<p>Everyone can help here.  If you have a suggestion to add to the documentation, write it up and send it to <a href="mailto:freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org</a></p>

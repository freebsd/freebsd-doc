  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>FreeBSD/xbox is a port of FreeBSD which aims to run on Microsoft&reg;
    Xbox&reg; systems.  This project was started by <a
    href="mailto:rink@FreeBSD.org">&a.rink;</a>, who did most of the patching
    and coding.  <a href="mailto:ed@FreeBSD.org">Ed Schouten</a> helped with
    reviewing patches and he also provided details on certain Xbox
    internals.</p>

  <h3>Status</h3>

  <p>&os;/xbox has been supported since FreeBSD 6-STABLE.
    The framebuffer, Ethernet, sound and USB devices
    (such as an USB keyboard for the console) are all supported.</p>

  <p>In order to aid people in installing the FreeBSD/xbox port, a combined
    install/livecd has been <a
    href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2006-August/027894.html">created</a>.
    It is available <a
    href="ftp://ftp.stack.nl/pub/freebsd-xbox/">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Booting &os; kernels</h3>

  <p>In order to boot &os; you must have an up-to-date
    version of the Linux/xbox BIOS, called Cromwell (failure will result in your
    kernel crashing immediately after loading).  A Cromwell with FreeBSD UFS
    patches (this will make it able to load a kernel directly from an UFS file
    system) is available in the ports tree at /usr/ports/sysutils/cromwell; it
    can be flashed to the EEPROM using the /usr/ports/sysutils/raincoat port (as
    long as your Xbox is below version 1.6).</p>

  <p><b>Note</b>: Several Xbox drives are known to reject certain types of media.
    Should you experience random hangs, panics or corruption during installation,
    try a different known-working DVD/CD-ROM.</p>

  <h3>Installing on the hard drive</h3>

  <p>You can do an installation using the Live CD's, but you will need to do
    everything manually.  It is suggested to prepare your disk using an FreeBSD/i386
    installation and set up the /boot/xboxlinux.cfg configuration
    file yourself, so Cromwell can determine which kernel to load.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>&os;/&arch.pc98; is a port of &os; which aims to run
      on the NEC PC-98x1 (pc98) architecture.
      The project's goal is to make &os;/&arch.pc98; work
      the same as FreeBSD on other architectures.
      Most of the kernel source is already included in the FreeBSD source tree
      and most of the userland utilities built from the source work fine.</p>

    <h3>Status</h3>

    <p>&os;/&arch.pc98; support was removed from 12.0 in revision
      <tt>r312910</tt>.</p>

    <p>&os;/&arch.pc98; was a <a
      href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/archs.html">
      Tier 2</a> architecture at the time of 9.0-RELEASE.</p>

    <p>Although
      FreeBSD/pc98 was a Tier 1 for a long time since 5.0-RELEASE, it was
      downgraded due to FreeBSD no longer supporting installation from
      floppy disks, and most pc98 machines cannot boot from CD/DVD.
      Although later pc98 machines can boot from CDROM, FreeBSD's support
      for that has not been integrated into bsdinstall and release tools.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This page contains information about the FreeBSD port to the
      ARM architecture and hardware.  Discussion of the ARM port takes
      place on the
      <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-arm">freebsd-arm</a>
      mailing list.</p>

    <h3><a name="status">Status</a></h3>

    <p>ARM is officially a
      <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/archs.html">
      Tier 2</a> architecture, as the <a href="&base;">FreeBSD</a> project
      does not provide official releases or pre-built packages for this
      platform due to it primarily targeting the embedded arena.  However,
      FreeBSD/ARM is being actively developed and maintained, is well supported,
      and provides an excellent framework for building ARM-based systems.</p>

    <h3><a name="hw">FreeBSD/ARM Hardware Notes</a></h3>

    <p>FreeBSD should work on the i80321 based Intel XScale&reg 
      devboards, which includes the IQ31244 and IQ80321 boards.
      Support is still minimal, covering only the CPU, PCI-X bus,
      em(4) Ethernet adapters, the UART and timer devices.</p>

    <p>The i80219 XScale processor is supported, as is the EP80219
      devboard.</p>

    <p>The IXP425 is supported, as is the Avila GW2348-4 devboard.</p>

    <p>The Atmel AT91RM9200 CPU/Microcontroller range is supported.
      Support is provided for the Kwikbyte KB9202 devboard range, the
      BWCT board and the Hot-e HL200 thin client device.</p>

    <p>Minimal support for the StrongARM 1100 CPU is provided, but
      only within the limits of what Simics emulate: CPU,  UART and
      clock.  It is theoretically possible to boot on the Assabet board,
      the one Simics emulates; no attempts, successful or unsuccessful,
      have been reported.</p>

    <p>Additionally, support for the Technologic Systems TS-7200 devboard
      is in the works, as is support for the Atmel AT91SAM926x CPU and
      the Marvell Orion ARM SoC, the Samsung S3C2XX0 range, and Cirrus
      Logic EP93XX CPUs.</p>

    <h3><a name="todo">What Needs To Be Done</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>SATA support needs to be added.</li>

      <li>Other devices, such as watchdog, i2c and bus should be merged
        from NetBSD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="miniinst">Mini-Install guide</a></h3>

      <p>&a.cognet; (cognet@FreeBSD.org) has written a mini-install guide for the
        current FreeBSD source.  It is
      <a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~cognet/arm.html">available here</a>.</p>

    <h3>What musicians say about FreeBSD/ARM</h3>

    <p>With FreeBSD/ARM, you can enjoy the silence from running your
      (embedded) computer.  There's even a song of that name, "Enjoy
      The Silence", by Depeche Mode:</p>

      <pre>All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my ARMs
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm</pre>

    <p>The little red fellow that graces many of these pages is
      the BSD Daemon.  In the context of &unix; systems, daemons
      are process that run in the background attending to various
      tasks without human intervention.  In the general sense,
      daemon is an older form of the word demon.  In the <em>Unix
      System Administration Handbook</em>, Evi Nemeth has this to
      say about daemons:</p>

    <blockquote>"Many people equate the word ``daemon'' with the
      word ``demon,'' implying some kind of Satanic connection
      between UNIX and the underworld.  This is an egregious
      misunderstanding.  ``Daemon'' is actually a much older form
      of ``demon''; daemons have no particular bias towards good
      or evil, but rather serve to help define a person's
      character or personality.  The ancient Greeks' concept of a
      ``personal daemon'' was similar to the modern concept of a
      ``guardian angel'' --- ``eudaemonia'' is the state of being
      helped or protected by a kindly spirit.  As a rule, UNIX
      systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons."
      (p403)
    </blockquote>

    <p>The earliest (and most popular) renditions of the BSD Daemon were
      created by John Lasseter.  More recent FreeBSD-specific
      renditions have done by
      <a href="http://FromTo.Cc/hosokawa/gallery/">
      Tatsumi Hosokawa</a>, but the basic inspiration was definitely John's.

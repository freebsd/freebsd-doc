<p>The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project
  issues associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  The main
  responsibilities of this team are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To grant approval for new documentation committers.  Documentation
    includes articles and books, website pages, manual pages, release
    notes and translations of the above.  There are two kinds of
    doc commit bits: translator commit bit, which is limited to
    translations in a particular language and full commit bit, which
    is only granted to aspirants, who have shown enough English
    writing skills.</li>

  <li>To maintain the doc project primer, which documents best
      practices for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.</li>

  <li>To manage the doc/ release process.  This includes coordinating
      the release documentation updates with the various translation
      teams, coordinating with the release engineering team to tag the
      doc/ tree during the release cycle, and documenting these
      procedures.</li>

  <li>To ensure that the generated documentation (PDF, HTML, etc.) on
      the Web site and FTP site are up to date with respect to the
      versions of the documents in the SVN tree.  This includes making
      sure the Web site build is functioning correctly, and also
      involves working with the admin team to ensure that the primary
      Web server has all of the requisite software installed
      (including build scripts).</li>

  <li>To act as MAINTAINER (when necessary) or to work in coordination
      with existing MAINTAINERs, to ensure that the documentation
      toolchains (DocBook, groff, etc.) are in good working order.</li>

  <li>To maintain the sanctity of the FreeBSD doc/ and www/ trees.
      Due to the visibility of these files and documents to the
      outside world, doceng@ reserves the right to immediately backout
      (or fix without waiting for response from the original
      committer) changes that introduce broken links, cause the Web
      site build to break, or otherwise degrade the accessibility of
      the FreeBSD Web site and documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is specifically noted here that doceng@ is <strong>not</strong> a conflict
resolution body for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  Discussion and
consensus on the freebsd-doc mailing list is how the project has
conducted itself, and how it is expected to conduct itself in the
future.</p>

<h2>Current Membership</h2>

The current members of this team are &a.doceng;.

<h2>New Doc Committers</h2>

New doc committers are approved by doceng@ with a vote through email
and a two week timeout.  A committer is approved if at least one doceng@
member votes yes, and no doceng@ members vote no.

When a commit bit proposal is accepted, doceng@ sends out an
acceptance email to the mentor and the new committer with core@
and accounts@ CC'ed.

<h2>Idle Doc Committers</h2>

Doc Committers that have not made a commit in 12 months will be
contacted by a doceng@ member and without a response after a delay of
2 weeks, these committers will be automatically removed from the
access file.  In case of no response, doceng@ will also contact core@
about the idle committers.

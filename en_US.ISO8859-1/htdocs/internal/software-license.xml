    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <p>The FreeBSD Project aims to produce a complete, BSD-licensed
    operating system allowing consumers of the system to produce
    derivative products without constraint or further license
    obligations.  We invite and greatly appreciate the contribution of
    both changes and additions under the two-clause BSD license, and
    encourage the adoption of this license by other open source
    projects.  Use of the BSD license is key to encouraging the
    adoption of advanced operating system technology, and on many
    notable occasions has been pivotal to widespread use of new
    technology.</p>

    <p>We accept however that compelling reasons exist to allow
    differently-licensed software to be included in the FreeBSD source
    tree.</p>

    <p>We require any software under alternative licenses to be
    carefully isolated in the source tree so that it cannot
    contaminate BSD-only components.  Such cautious management
    encourages licensing clarity and facilitates the production of
    BSD-only derivative products.</p>

    <p>Unless a special exception is made, no existing BSD-licensed
    components may be replaced with differently-licensed software.  We
    instead encourage FreeBSD and third party developers to seek the
    relicensing or reimplementation of critical components under the
    BSD license.  Such would ease their more integral adoption into
    the FreeBSD operating system.</p>

    <h2>Policy</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>The import of new software licensed under any licenses
	other than the BSD license and BSD-Like Licenses (as defined
	below) requires the prior approval of the FreeBSD Core Team.
	Requests for import must include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>A list of features or bug fixes that the new version or
	    patches contain, along with evidence that our users need
	    those features.  PRs or references to mailing list
	    discussions are ideal forms of evidence.</p>

	    <p>This process should be used for all software imports,
	    not just those that require Core Team review.  The mere
	    existence of a new version does not justify an import of
	    software to source or ports.</p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>A list of FreeBSD branches that may be affected.
	    Expansions of scope require a new request to and approval
	    from the FreeBSD Core Team.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>We will allow existing GPLv2 licensed software to be
	converted to GPLv3 or other similar license changes on a
	case-by-case basis provided that the FreeBSD Core Team is
	given appropriate technical justification.</p>

	<p>Each piece of software that is being converted to a
	different license must be submitted to the FreeBSD Core Team
	for approval through this process as though it were a new
	piece of software.</p>

	<p>For Free Software Foundation maintained software except
	GCC, GDB, and binutils, all patches posted after the date the
	software switched to GPLv3 will be considered to be covered by
	the GPLv3 and thus will be subject to this rule.  For GCC, GDB
	and binutils we accept the community practice of allowing
	patches to be relicensed under GPLv2 at the patch author's
	discretion.  The author's permission must be documented in the
	commit message for each patch that is committed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acceptable licenses</h3>

    <p>The following licenses are considered to be acceptable BSD-Like
    Licenses for the purpose of this Policy.  They must be reproduced
    verbatim on any new code.  Deviations or the use of any other
    license must be approved by the FreeBSD Core Team:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>The 2 clause version of the BSD license</p>

    <p>This page contains pointers to pages documenting aspects of the
      &os; project itself, as viewed separately from the
      codebase.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>There are various projects which lie <a
	href="../projects/projects.html">outside the mainstream
	development path</a>.  A number of groups are working on the
      'cutting edge' to expand &os;'s range of capabilities in new
      directions.</p>

    <p>Here is an overview of the <a
	href="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/freebsd-releng/article.html">
	&os; Release Engineering Process</a>.</p>

    <p>And here you will find the <a
	href="../releng/index.html">schedules for upcoming official
	releases of &os;.</a></p>

    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <p>To avoid chaos with a project this large spread out all over
      the globe, there have to be some <a
	  href="policies.html">Policies for &os;
	Committers</a>.</p>

    <h2>People</h2>

    <p>The &os;&nbsp;Project Staff consists of <a
	href="../administration.html">teams, groups and
	individuals</a> with designated project roles and areas of
      responsibility and the <a
	href="../doc/en/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html">developers</a>.
      By following the links, one will find a list of them, as well as
      explanations of who is responsible for what.</p>

    <p>You can read here core's <a href="hats.html">Hat Term Limits
	Policy</a> and some guidelines from &a.imp; on <a
	href="working-with-hats.html">how to work with hats</a>.</p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <p>Here is a list of some <a href="developer.html">technical
	resources for &os; committers</a>.</p>

    <p>For those with accounts on <a href="machines.html">the main
	FreeBSD.org network</a>, here are the machine resources that
      are available and the sorts of work they are intended for.</p>

    <p>You can learn more <a href="about.html">about the &os; WWW
	server</a>, including the machine, the software, mirroring the
      &os; web pages.</p>

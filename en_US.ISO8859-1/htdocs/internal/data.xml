  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>The FreeBSD Project provides several resources for developers
    including various machines and data storage.  These resources are
    intended to be used for activities related to the FreeBSD Project.
    The project does not make any guarantees to developers regarding
    non-project-related data stored on project resources.  Developers
    are strongly encouraged to not use project resources for storing
    non-project-related data.  The FreeBSD Core team approved the
    following user data policy which was posted to the Developers
    mailing list on August 4, 2011.</p>

  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>FreeBSD Project resources should only be used for project-related
    activities and storing project-related data.</p>

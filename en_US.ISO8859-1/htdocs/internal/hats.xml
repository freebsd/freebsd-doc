  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>The FreeBSD Core team appoints several individuals
    (&quot;hats&quot;) that perform critical roles within the
    project.  It is important to reduce single points of failure in
    these roles.  Additionally, turnover in hats can provide fresh
    insight and help avoid burnout.</p>

  <p>The current set of core-appointed hats is core secretary, head
    release engineer, the security officer, and postmaster.</p>

  <p>It is suggested that shortened terms longer than half of a core
    term be considered a full term for purposes of eligibility.</p>

  <p>This policy will begin with the start of the next core term, and
    all hats will start off with zero terms at that time.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Core team approved the following hats term limits
    policy which was posted to the Developers mailing list on June 22,
    2012.</p>

  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>An individual may serve as a core-appointed hat for at most two
    consecutive terms.  Each hat's term begins three months after the
    start of a core team's term and ends three months after the end of
    a core team's term.  Hats are explicitly approved by the new core
    team at the start of a hat's term.  An individual who serves as a
    hat for two consecutive terms may serve again after a break of at
    least one full term.</p>

  <p>Core shall review all hats annually.</p>

  <p>If a hat becomes vacant during a term, core shall appoint a
    replacement for the remainder of the term.  It is at core's
    discretion whether the shortened term will count for purposes of
    limiting the terms of the replacement.</p>

  <p>If a core team is dissolved prematurely, then the next term for
    each hat will begin three months after the new core team's term
    begins.  It is at the new core's discretion whether the shortened
    term will count for purposes of limiting the terms of current
    hats.</p>

  <p>These limits apply to individual hats and not to teams.  For
    teams with a single lead role, the limits shall apply to the lead
    role.  An individual that is not eligible to serve as the lead of
    a team may continue to serve as a member of the team.</p>

  <h2>Proposing a new committer</h2>

  <p>If you want to propose a new committer, you should send the following
    information to the appropriate entity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information on what established (FreeBSD) track record the
      nominee has.  This is <em>not</em> optional.</li>
    <li>Who has volunteered to become the mentor for the new
      committer.</li>
    <li>The email address of the nominee (remarkably often this
      is omitted).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any commit bit requests that do not follow the guidelines outlined
    above will be delayed (at best) or earn you negative vibrations from the
    respective team / team secretary.  For some guidelines on how the
    proposal itself should be written, please see <a
      href="proposing-committers.html">a brief summary</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Responsible party for this procedure is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>src --&gt; core@</li>
    <li>doc --&gt; doceng@</li>
    <li>ports --&gt; portmgr@</li>
  </ul>

  <p> You will get ACK after the message is seen, and core@, doceng@ and portmgr@
    will give you a response after voting is finished or when the timeout is hit.
    The timeout for core@ and portmgr@ is set to 7 days while for doceng@ it is
    14 days, however, as indicated, this is just a worst case and team members
    may finish voting earlier.</p>

  <h2>Authorizing A New Account</h2>

  <p>Someone from the list below sends a PGP-signed email to
    accounts@, the person assigned as the mentor to the new
    committer, and copied to core@FreeBSD.org confirming the approval of
    the new account.  This email should include a link to this document
    so the mentor/mentee know what is expected of them.</p>

  <p>New account approvals are only valid from these PGP entities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>core-secretary (for src commit bits)</p></li>
    <li><p>portmgr-secretary (for ports commit bits)</p></li>
    <li><p>doceng (for doc commit bits)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>NOTE:  New account requests from anyone other than these
    entities or requests signed with PGP keys other than from these
    entities will not be acted upon.  No exceptions.  In case of
    a new ports or doc committer the account request email should be
    CC:-ed to core.</i></p>

  <h2>Information Needed From The Mentor</h2>

  <p>The person assigned as the new committers' mentor needs to collect
    and send the following information to accounts@:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>username (lowercase a-z and 0-9)</p></li>
    <li><p>Full Name (as would go in a GECOS field; UTF-8 encoded)</p></li>
    <li><p>optional additional GECOS information (phone, location etc)</p></li>
    <li><p>shell (sh, csh/tcsh, bash, zsh are available)</p></li>
    <li><p>ssh V2 public key</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The mentor is responsible for obtaining this information from the
    new committer in a secure fashion, and providing it to accounts@ in
    a secure fashion.  PGP-signed email, with the mentor's public key
    already committed to the Handbook, is the preferred method for the
    mentor to send the information to accounts@.  If this is impossible
    for some reason an acceptable substitute is for the mentor to place
    the account information in their home directory on freefall and then
    tell accounts@ where to find it.  We need to be sure the account
    information really is coming from the Mentor and unsigned email is
    not sufficient for this these days.  Since accounts@ has no way to
    verify anything from the new Committer this information needs to
    be sent to accounts@ by the Mentor, not the new Committer.</p>

  <h2>accounts@ Creates New Account</h2>

  <p>accounts@ creates the new account with the above
    information on the FreeBSD.org cluster and notifies the mentor and
    the new committer.</p>

  <h2>Mentor Activates New Committer's Commit Bit</h2>

  <p>After the new committer confirms that the account works, the mentor
    adds the new committer to the correct <tt>access</tt> file,
    using an appropriate commit message.  The commit message should at least
    contain the committer's full name and username, the mentor's
    name and what area the new committer will start to work in.
    An entry should also be added to the <tt>mentors</tt> file in
    the respective Subversion repository to indicate
    the mentor relationship. Having done all that,
    the new committer and mentor jointly go through the first commit
    operations.</p>

  <h2>Additional Services</h2>

  <p>The mentor should add the new committer to the <a
      href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevelopersGroup">Developers
      group</a> on the wiki and to the <a
      href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/project/view/3/">committer</a>
      project on Phabricator.</p>

  <p>Reading the <a
      href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/index.html">Committer's
    Guide</a> is considered a good first step for new committers, especially
    the <a
      href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/conventions.html">Conventions
    and Traditions</a> section.</p>

  <h2>End Of Mentorship</h2>

  <p>There is no pre-set duration for a mentorship.  Once the mentor feels
    the mentee is ready to 'fly solo' the mentor notifies the developer
    community by removing the entry from the <tt>mentors</tt> file in
    SVN.</p>

  <h2>Transfer Of Mentorship</h2>

  <p>Should a need arise to transfer mentorship for a committer
    please email the responsible party, as described for a new account
    proposal.  Typically this request is rubberstamped as-is.
    In Subversion, the <tt>mentors</tt> file should be updated.</p>

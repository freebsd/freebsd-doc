<p>This page contains pointers to pages documenting aspects of
the FreeBSD project itself, as viewed separately from the codebase.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>There are various
<a href="../projects/projects.html">
projects which lie outside the mainstream development path</a>,
in which a number of groups are working on the 'cutting edge'
to expand FreeBSD's range of capabilities in new directions.</p>

<p>Here is an overview of the
<a href="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/releng/article.html">
FreeBSD Release Engineering Process</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the official
<a href="../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/portbuild/article.html">
package building procedures</a>.</p>

<p>And here you will find the
<a href="../releng/index.html">schedules for upcoming official releases
of FreeBSD.</a></p>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>To avoid chaos with a project this large spread out all over
the globe, there have to be some

<h2>People</h2>

<p>The &os;&nbsp;Project Staff consists of <a
    href="../administration.html">teams, groups and individuals</a>
   with designated project roles and areas of responsibility and the <a

  By following the links, one will find a list of them, as well as
  explanations of who is responsible for what.</p>

<p>Here are some

<a href="../multimedia/tag-photos.html">photos from social events</a>.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Here is a list of some
<a href="developer.html">technical resources for FreeBSD committers</a>.</p>

<p>For those with accounts on
<a href="machines.html">the main FreeBSD.org network</a>,
here are the machine resources that are available and the
sorts of work they are intended for.</p>

<p>You can learn more

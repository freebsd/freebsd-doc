    <h2>&os; Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>The &os; Project is inclusive.  We want the &os; Project
      to be a venue where people of all backgrounds can work together
      to make the best operating system, built by a strong community.
      These values extend beyond just development to all aspects of
      the Project.  All those given recognition as members of the
      Project in whatever form are seen as ambassadors of the
      Project.</p>

    <p>Diversity is a huge strength and is critical to the long term
      success of the Project.  To that end we have a few ground rules
      that we ask people to adhere to.  This code applies equally to
      everyone representing the &os; Project in any way, from new
      members, to committers, to the core team itself.  These rules
      are intended to ensure a safe, harassment-free environment for
      all and to ensure that everyone feels welcome both working
      within, and interacting with, the Project.</p>

    <p>This document is not an exhaustive list of things that you
      should not do.  Rather, consider it a guide to make it easier to
      enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
      participate.</p>

    <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces used by the &os;
      Project, including our mailing lists, IRC channels, and social
      media, both online and off.  Anyone who is found to violate this
      code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from &os;
      Project controlled spaces at the discretion of the &os; Code
      of Conduct Committee.</p>

    <p>Some &os; Project spaces may have additional rules in place,
      which will be made clearly available to participants.
      Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these
      rules.  Harassment includes but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Comments that reinforce systemic oppression related to
	gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	disability, mental illness, neurodiversity, physical
	appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>

      <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices
	and practices, including those related to food, health,
	parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>

      <li>Deliberate misgendering.</li>

      <li>Deliberate use of &quot;dead&quot; or rejected names.</li>

      <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces
	where they're not appropriate.</li>

      <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g.,
	textual descriptions like &quot;*hug*&quot; or
	&quot;*backrub*&quot;) without consent or after a request
	to stop.</li>

      <li>Threats of violence.</li>

      <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including
	encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in
	self-harm.</li>

      <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>

      <li>Stalking or following.</li>

      <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online
	activity for harassment purposes.</li>

      <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>

      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>

      <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as
	requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
	others.</li>

      <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to
	cease.</li>

      <li>Deliberate &quot;outing&quot; of any private aspect of a
	person's identity without their consent except as necessary to
	protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without
	consent.</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication with
	consent but in a way that intentionally misrepresents the
	communication (e.g., removes context that changes the
	meaning).</li>

      <li>Knowingly making harmful false claims about a person.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reporting Instructions</h2>

    <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask
      that you report it to the &os; Code of Conduct Committee by
      emailing <a
      href="mailto:conduct@freebsd.org">conduct@freebsd.org</a>.</p>

    <p>All reports will be kept confidential whenever possible.  We
      strive to protect the identity and safety of reporters.  In some
      cases we may need to make a public statement of some form, in
      which case we will use the minimum of details and identifying
      information necessary to protect our community.  In rare cases,
      we may need to identify some of the people involved to comply
      with the law or protect other potential victims.  In these
      cases, we will consult with the reporter to find out what their
      wishes are and take them into account in our final decision.  In
      all cases, we will not directly or indirectly identify reporters
      without their consent unless we see no other option.</p>

    <p>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify
      appropriate law enforcement first.</p>

    <p>In your report please include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your name and contact info (so we can get in touch with you
	if we need to follow up)</li>

      <li>Names (real, nicknames, and/or pseudonyms) of any
	individuals involved.  If there were other witnesses besides
	you, please try to include them as well.</li>

      <li>When and where the incident occurred.  Please be as specific
	as possible.</li>

      <li>Your account of what occurred.  If there is a publicly
	available record (e.g. a mailing list archive, tweet, or a
	public IRC logger) please include a link and/or screen
	shots.</li>

      <li>Any extra context you believe relevant for the
	incident.</li>

      <li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>

      <li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens after you file a report?</h2>

    <p>You will receive an email from the &os; Code of Conduct
      Committee acknowledging receipt of your report within 48
      hours.</p>

    <p>The committee will meet as quickly as possible to review the
      incident and determine:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Whether an investigation is needed, including interviewing
	additional parties or witnesses;</li>

      <li>What appears to have happened and;</li>

      <li>Whether the behavior constitutes a Code of Conduct
	violation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a member of the &os; Code of Conduct Committee is one of
      the individuals included in the report they will recuse
      themselves from handling the report.</p>

    <p>Once the working group has a complete account of the events
      they will make a decision as to how to respond.  Actions taken
      may include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nothing (for example, if we determine that no violation
	occurred).</li>

      <li>If determined to be solely technical in nature or if it
	falls outside the scope of the Code of Conduct, forwarding the
	incident to the &os; Core Team</li>

      <li>A private reprimand from the working group to the
	individual(s) involved.</li>

      <li>A public reprimand.</li>

      <li>An imposed vacation from &os; Project controlled spaces
	(e.g. asking someone to &quot;take a week off&quot; from a
	mailing list or IRC).</li>

      <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all &os;
	Project controlled spaces (events, meetings, mailing lists,
	IRC, etc.)</li>

      <li>A request for a public or private apology.</li>

      <li>A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability
	plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will do our best to respond within one week to the person
      who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation
      of why the situation is not yet resolved.</p>

    <p>Once we have determined our final action, we will contact the
      original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we will
      be taking.  We will take into account feedback from the reporter
      on the appropriateness of our response, but we do not guarantee
      we will act on it.</p>

    <p>Finally, the committee will make a report on the situation to
      the &os; Core Team.  The Core Team may choose to issue a
      public report of the incident.</p>

    <h2>Appeals</h2>

    <p>Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed.  To
      appeal a decision of the CoC Committee, contact the &os; Core
      Team at <a href="mailto:core@freebsd.org">core@freebsd.org</a>
      with your appeal and the Core Team will review the case.</p>

    <h2>Glossary</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Systemic oppression:</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>The ways in which history, culture, ideology, public
	  policies, institutional practices, and personal behaviors
	  and beliefs interact to maintain a hierarchy &mdash; based
	  on race, class, gender, sexuality, and/or other group
	  identities &mdash; that allows the privileges associated
	  with the dominant group and the disadvantages associated
	  with the oppressed, targeted, or marginalized group to
	  endure and adapt over time.  (Derived from Aspen Institute,
	  via Open Source Leadership)</p></dd>

      <dt>Dead names:</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>A name assigned to a person at birth which they no longer
	  identify with.  Most often used to refer to the assigned
	  name of a trans person who has publicly identified
	  themselves under a new name.  Deliberately using a dead name
	  is an act of hostility.</p></dd></dl>

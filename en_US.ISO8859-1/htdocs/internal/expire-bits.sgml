  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>Over time, FreeBSD committers may find other demands on their time,
    and decide that they wish to resign their commit bit.  However, under
    some circumstances, a committer may become inactive over a long period
    of time without explicitly resigning their bit.  Over the long term,
    these accounts can represent a security risk, as well as posing
    procedural questions regarding the degree to which contact information
    and access methods for the account are maintainable.  For these
    reasons, the FreeBSD Core Team approved the following commit bit
    expiration policy, which was posted to the Developers mailing list
    on February 22, 2002.</p>

  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>Committers that haven't made a commit in 18 months will be removed
    from the access file from time to time.  Committers that wish to get
    back their commit bits will have to reapply with the appropriate
    authority.  Future refinements to this policy may be forthcoming.</p>

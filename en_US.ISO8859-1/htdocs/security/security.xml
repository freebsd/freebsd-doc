  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are
    constantly working on making the operating system as secure as
    possible. This page will provide information about what to do in
    the event of a security vulnerability affecting your system, and
    how to report vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#recent">Recent FreeBSD security vulnerabilities</a></li>

  <h2>Recent FreeBSD security vulnerabilities</h2>

  <p>A full list of all security vulnerabilities can be found <a
      href="advisories.html">on this page</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to update your system</h2>

  <p>For most users, the easiest way to update your supported &os;
    &rel.current; or &rel2.current; system is to use the following
    commands:</p>

  <tt># freebsd-update fetch<br />
    # freebsd-update install</tt>

  <p>If that fails, follow the other instructions in the security
    advisory you care about.</p>

  <h2>Supported FreeBSD releases</h2>

  <p>The current designation and estimated lifetimes of the currently
    supported branches are given below.  The <em>Estimated EoL
    (end-of-life)</em> column gives the earliest date on which that
    branch is likely to be dropped.  Please note that these dates may
    be extended into the future, but only extenuating circumstances
    would lead to a branch's support being dropped earlier than the
    date listed.</p>

  <!--
      Please also update head/en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/releng/index.xml
      when updating this list of supported branches.

  <p>Older releases are not maintained and users are strongly
    encouraged to upgrade to one of the supported releases mentioned
    above.  A list of unsupported releases can be found <a
      href="unsupported.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Advisories are sent to the following FreeBSD mailing lists:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>FreeBSD-security-notifications@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-security@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-announce@FreeBSD.org</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list of released advisories can be found on the <a
      href="advisories.html">FreeBSD Security Advisories</a> page.</p>

  <p>Advisories are always signed using the FreeBSD Security Officer
    <a href="so_public_key.asc">PGP
      key</a> and are archived, along with their associated patches, at
    the <a href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/">http://security.FreeBSD.org/</a>
    web server in the <a
      href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/">advisories</a> and <a
      href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/">patches</a>
    subdirectories.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for
    <em>-STABLE Branches</em> and the <em>Security Branches</em>.
    (Advisories are not issued for the <em>-CURRENT Branch</em>.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>The -STABLE branch tags have
	names like <tt>stable/9</tt>.  The corresponding builds have
      names like <tt>FreeBSD 9.2-STABLE</tt>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch.
	The Security Branch tags have names like <tt>releng/9.2</tt>.
      The corresponding builds have names like <tt>FreeBSD
      9.2-RELEASE-p1</tt>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered in <a
      href="http://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/">the FreeBSD VuXML
      document</a>.</p>

  <p>Each branch is supported by the Security Officer for a limited
    time only, and is designated as one of `<em>Early adopter</em>',
    `<em>Normal</em>', or `<em>Extended</em>'.  The designation is
    used as a guideline for determining the lifetime of the branch as
    follows.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Early adopter</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from the -CURRENT branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 6 months after
      the release.</dd>
    <dt>Normal</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from a -STABLE branch will be
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 12 months after the
      release, and for sufficient additional time (if needed) to ensure
      that there is a newer release for at least 3 months before the
      older Normal release expires.
    </dd>
    <dt>Extended</dt>
    <dd>Selected releases (normally every second release plus the last
      release from each -STABLE branch) will be supported by the
      Security Officer for a minimum of 24 months after the release,
      and for sufficient additional time (if needed) to ensure that
      there is a newer Extended release for at least 3 months before the
      older Extended release expires.

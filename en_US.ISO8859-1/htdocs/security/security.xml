  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are
    constantly working on making the operating system as secure as
    possible.  This page will provide information about what to do in
    the event of a security vulnerability affecting your system</p>

  <a name="reporting"></a>
  <h2>Reporting FreeBSD security incidents</h2>

  <p>FreeBSD security issues specific to the base system
    should be reported via email to the <a
      href="mailto:secteam@FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Security Team</a>
    or, if a higher level of confidentiality is required, via PGP
    encrypted email to the <a
      href="mailto:security-officer@FreeBSD.org">Security Officer
      Team</a>
    using the <a href="so_public_key.asc">Security Officer PGP
      key</a>.
    Additional information can be found at the <a
      href="reporting.html">reporting FreeBSD security incidents</a>
    page.</p>

  <a name="recent"></a>
  <h2>Recent FreeBSD security vulnerabilities</h2>

  <p>A full list of all security vulnerabilities affecting the base
    system can be found <a href="advisories.html">on this
      page</a>.</p>

  <a name="advisories"></a>
  <h2>Understanding FreeBSD security advisories</h2>

  <p>Advisories affecting the base system are sent to the following
    mailing lists:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>FreeBSD-security-notifications@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-security@FreeBSD.org</li>
    <li>FreeBSD-announce@FreeBSD.org</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list of released advisories can be found on the <a
      href="advisories.html">FreeBSD Security Advisories</a> page.</p>

  <p>Advisories are always signed using the FreeBSD Security Officer
    <a href="so_public_key.asc">PGP key</a> and are archived, along
    with their associated patches, at the <a
      href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/">http://security.FreeBSD.org/</a>
    web server in the <a
      href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/">advisories</a>
    and <a href="http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/">patches</a>
    subdirectories.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for
    <em>-STABLE Branches</em> and the <em>Security Branches</em>.
    (Advisories are not issued for the <em>-CURRENT Branch</em>,
    which is primarily oriented towards &os; developers.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>The -STABLE branch tags have names like <tt>stable/10</tt>.
      The corresponding builds have names like <tt>FreeBSD
      10.1-STABLE</tt>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch.
      The Security Branch tags have names like <tt>releng/10.1</tt>.
      The corresponding builds have names like <tt>FreeBSD
      10.1-RELEASE-p4</tt>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered
    separately in <a href="http://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/">the FreeBSD
      VuXML document</a>.</p>

  <a name="how"></a>
  <h2>How to update your system</h2>

  <p>For users that have previously installed a binary version of &os;
    (e.g., &rel.current; or &rel2.current;),
    commands:</p>

  <tt># freebsd-update fetch<br />
    # freebsd-update install</tt>

  <p>If that fails, follow the other instructions in the security
    advisory you care about.</p>

  <p>Note that the above procedure is only for users who have
    previously installed a binary distribution.  Those who have
    built from source will need to update their source tree to
    upgrade.</p>

  <a name="sup"></a>
  <h2>Supported FreeBSD releases</h2>

  <p>Each release is supported by the Security Officer for a limited
    time only.</p>

  <p>The designation and expected lifetime of all currently supported
    branches
    and their respective releases
    are given below.  The <em>Expected EoL (end-of-life)</em>
    column indicates the earliest date on which support for that
    branch or release will end.  Please note that these dates may be
    pushed back if circumstances warrant it.</p>

  <p><a href="unsupported.html">Older releases</a>
    are not supported and users are strongly
    encouraged to upgrade to one of these supported releases:</p>

  <!--
      Please also update head/en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/releng/index.xml
      when updating this list of supported branches.

  <p>In the run-up to a release, a number of -BETA and -RC releases
    may be published for testing purposes.  These releases are only
    supported for a few weeks, as resources permit, and will not be
    listed as supported on this page.  Users are strongly discouraged
    from running these releases on production systems.</p>

  <a name="model"></a>
  <h2>The FreeBSD support model</h2>

  <p>Effective &os;&nbsp;11.0-RELEASE, the support model has been
    changed to allow more rapid development while also providing
    timely security updates for all supported releases.</p>

  <p>Under the new support model, each major version's stable branch
    is explicitly supported for 5 years, while each individual point
    release is only supported for three months after the next point
    release.</p>

  <p>The details and rationale behind this change can be found in the
    <a
      href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2015-February/001624.html">official
      announcement</a> sent in February 2015.</p>

  <p>Previously, branches were designated as either <em>Normal</em> or
    <em>Extended</em>.  The designation was used as a guideline for
    determining the lifetime of the branch as follows:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Normal</dt>
    <dd>Releases which are published from a -STABLE branch were
      supported by the Security Officer for a minimum of 12 months
      after the release, and for sufficient additional time (if
      needed) to ensure that there is a newer release for at least
      3 months before the older Normal release expires.
    </dd>
    <dt>Extended</dt>
    <dd>Selected releases (normally every second release plus the last
      release from each -STABLE branch) were supported by the Security
      Officer for a minimum of 24 months after the release, and for
      sufficient additional time (if needed) to ensure that there is
      a newer Extended release for at least 3 months before the older
      Extended release expires.
    </dd>

    <h1>FreeBSD offers many advanced features.</h1>

      <p>No matter what the application, you want your system's resources
	performing at their full potential.  FreeBSD's focus on
	performance, networking, and storage combine with easy system
	administration and excellent documentation to allow you to do just
	that.</p>

    <h2>A complete operating system based on 4.4BSD.</h2>

      <p>FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the <b>BSD</b>
	software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at the
	University of California, Berkeley.  Over ten years of work have been
	put into enhancing BSD, adding industry-leading SMP, multithreading,
	and network performance, as well as new management tools, file
	systems, and security features.  As a result, FreeBSD may be found
	across the Internet, in the operating system of core router products,
	running root name servers, hosting major web sites, and as the
	foundation for widely used desktop operating systems.  This is only
	possible because of the diverse and world-wide membership of the
	volunteer FreeBSD Project.</p>

    <h2>FreeBSD provides advanced operating system features, making it ideal
	across a range of systems, from embedded environments to high-end
	multiprocessor servers.</h2>

      <p><b>FreeBSD 7.0</b>, released February 2008, brings many new features
	and performance enhancements.  With a special focus on storage
	and multiprocessing performance, FreeBSD 7.0 shipped with support
	for Sun's <b>ZFS file system</b> and <b>highly scalable
	multiprocessing performance</b>.  Benchmarks have shown that FreeBSD
	provides twice the MySQL and PostgreSQL performance as current Linux
	systems on 8-core servers.</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>SMPng</b>: After seven years of development on advanced SMP
	  support, FreeBSD 7.0 realizes the goals of a fine-grained kernel
	  allowing linear scalability to over 8 CPU cores for many workloads.
	  FreeBSD 7.0 sees an almost complete elimination of the Giant Lock,
	  removing it from the CAM storage layer and NFS client, and moving
	  towards more fine-grained locking in the network subsystem.
	  Significant work has also been performed to optimize kernel
	  scheduling and locking primitives, and the optional ULE scheduler
	  allows thread CPU affinity and per-CPU run queues to reduce
	  overhead and increase cache-friendliness.  The libthr threading
	  package, providing 1:1 threading, is now the default.  Benchmarks
	  reveal a dramatic performance advantage over other &unix; operating
	  systems on identical multicore hardware, and reflect a long
	  investment in SMP technology for the FreeBSD kernel.</li>

	<li><b>ZFS filesystem</b>: Sun's ZFS is a state-of-the-art file
	  system offering simple administration, transactional semantics,
	  end-to-end data integrity, and immense scalability.  From
	  self-healing to built-in compression, RAID, snapshots, and volume
	  management, ZFS will allow FreeBSD system administrators to easily
	  manage large storage arrays.</li>

	<li><b>10Gbps network optimization</b>: With optimized device drivers
	  from all major 10gbps network vendors, FreeBSD 7.0 has seen
	  extensive optimization of the network stack for high performance
	  workloads, including auto-scaling socket buffers, TCP Segment
	  Offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), direct network stack
	  dispatch, and load balancing of TCP/IP workloads over multiple CPUs
	  on supporting 10gbps cards or when multiple network interfaces are
	  in use simultaneously.  Full vendor support is available from
	  Chelsio, Intel, Myricom, and Neterion.</li>

	<li><b>SCTP</b>: FreeBSD 7.0 is the reference implementation for the
	  new IETF Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) protocol,
	  intended to support VoIP, telecommunications, and other
	  applications with strong reliability and variable quality
	  transmission through features such as multi-path delivery,
	  fail-over, and multi-streaming.</li>

	<li><b>Wireless</b>: FreeBSD 7.0 ships with significantly enhanced
	  wireless support, including high-power Atheros-based cards, new
	  drivers for Ralink, Intel, and ZyDAS cards, WPA, background
	  scanning and roaming, and 802.11n.</li>

	<li><b>New hardware architectures</b>: FreeBSD 7.0 includes
	  significantly improved  support for the embedded ARM architecture,
	  as well as preliminary support for the Sun Ultrasparc T1
	  platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>FreeBSD has a long history of advanced operating system feature
	development; you can read about some of these features below:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>A merged virtual memory and filesystem buffer cache</b>
	  continuously tunes the amount of memory used for programs and the
	  disk cache.  As a result, programs receive both excellent memory
	    management and high performance disk access, and the system
	    administrator is freed from the task of tuning cache sizes.</li>

	<li><b>Compatibility modules</b> enable programs for other operating
	  systems to run on FreeBSD, including programs for Linux, SCO UNIX,
	  and System V Release 4.</li>

	<li><b>Soft Updates</b> allows improved filesystem
	  performance without sacrificing safety and reliability.
	  It analyzes meta-data filesystem operations to avoid having
	  to perform all of those operations synchronously.
	  Instead, it maintains internal state about pending meta-data
	  operations and uses this information to cache meta-data,
	  rewrite meta-data operations to combine subsequent
	  operations on the same files, and reorder meta-data
	  operations so that they may be processed more efficiently.
	  Features such as background filesystem checking and
	  file system snapshots are built on the consistency
	  and performance foundations of soft updates.</li>

	<li><b>File system snapshots</b>, permitting administrators to take
	  atomic file system snapshots for backup purposes using the free
	  space in the file system, as well as facilitating <b>background
	  fsck</b>, which allows the system to reach multiuser mode without
	  waiting on file system cleanup operations following power outages.
	  </li>

	<li>Support for <b>IP Security (IPsec)</b> allows improved security in
	  networks, and support for the next-generation Internet Protocol,
	  IPv6.  The FreeBSD IPsec implementation includes support for a
	  broad range of <b>accelerated crypto hardware</b>.</li>

	<li><b>Out of the box support for IPv6</b> via the KAME IPv6 stack
	  allows FreeBSD to be seamlessly integrated into next generation
	  networking environments.  FreeBSD even ships with many applications
	  extended to support IPv6!</li>

	<li><b>Multi-threaded SMP architecture</b> capable of executing the
	  kernel in parallel on multiple processors, and with <b>kernel
	  preemption</b>, allowing high priority kernel tasks to preempt
	  other kernel activity, reducing latency.  This includes a
	  <b>multi-threaded network stack</b> and a <b>multi-threaded
	  virtual memory subsystem</b>.  Beginning with FreeBSD 6.x, support
	  for a fully parallel VFS allows the UFS file system to run on multiple
	  processors simultaneously, permitting load sharing of
	  CPU-intensive I/O optimization.</li>

	<li><b>M:N application threading via pthreads</b> permitting threads
	  to execute on multiple CPUs in a scalable manner, mapping many user
	  threads onto a small number of <b>Kernel Schedulable Entities</b>.
	  By adopting the <b>Scheduler Activation</b> model, the threading
	  approach can be adapted to the specific requirements of a broad
	  range of applications.</li>

	<li><b>Netgraph pluggable network stack</b> allows developers to
	  dynamically and easily extend the network stack through clean
	  layered network abstractions.  Netgraph nodes can implement a broad
	  range of new network services, including encapsulation, tunneling,
	  encryption, and performance adaptation.  As a result, rapid
	  prototyping and production deployment of enhanced network services
	  can be performed far more easily and with fewer bugs.</li>

	<li><b>TrustedBSD MAC Framework extensible kernel security</b>,
	  which allows developers to customize the operating system security
	  model for specific environments, from creating hardening policies
	  to deploying mandatory labeled confidentiality of integrity
	  policies.  Sample security policies include <b>Multi-Level
	  Security (MLS)</b>, and <b>Biba Integrity Protection</b>.  Third
	  party modules include <b>SEBSD</b>, a FLASK-based implementation
	  of <b>Type Enforcement</b>.</li>

	<li><b>TrustedBSD Audit</b> is a security event logging service,
	  providing fine-grained, secure, reliable logging of system events
	  via the audit service.  Administrators can configure the nature and
	  granularity of logging by user, tracking file accesses, commands
	  executed, network activity, system logins, and a range of other
	  system behavior.  Audit pipes allow IDS tools to attach to the
	  kernel audit service and subscribe to events they require for
	  security monitoring.  FreeBSD supports the industry-standard BSM
	  audit trail file format and API, allowing existing BSM tools to
	  run with little or no modification.  This file format is used on
	  Solaris and Mac OS X, allowing instant interoperability and unified
	  analysis.</li>

	<li><b>GEOM pluggable storage layer</b>, which permits new storage
	  services to be quickly developed and cleanly integrated into the
	  FreeBSD storage subsystem.  GEOM provides a consistent and
	  coherent model for discovering and layering storage services,
	  making it possible to layer services such as RAID and volume
	  management easily.</li>

	<li>FreeBSD's <b>GEOM-Based Disk Encryption (GBDE)</b>, provides
	  strong cryptographic protection using the GEOM Framework, and can
	  protect file systems, swap devices, and other use of storage
	  media.</li>

	<li><b>Kernel Queues</b> allow programs to respond more efficiently
	  to a variety of asynchronous events including file and socket IO,
	  improving application and system performance.</li>

	<li><b>Accept Filters</b> allow connection-intensive applications,
	  such as web servers, to cleanly push part of their functionality into
	  the operating system kernel, improving performance.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>FreeBSD provides many security features
      to protect networks and servers.</h2>

      <p>The FreeBSD developers are as concerned about security as they are
	about performance and stability.  FreeBSD includes kernel support for
	<b>stateful IP firewalling</b>, as well as other services, such as
	<b>IP proxy gateways</b>, <b>access control lists</b>, <b>mandatory
	access control</b>, <b>jail-based virtual hosting</b>, and
	<b>cryptographically protected storage</b>.  These features can be
	used to support highly secure hosting of mutually untrusting
	customers or consumers, the strong partitioning of network segments,
	and the construction of secure pipelines for information scrubbing
	and information flow control.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD also includes support for encryption software, secure
	shells, Kerberos authentication, "virtual servers" created using
	jails, chroot-ing services to restrict application access to the
	file system, Secure RPC facilities, and access lists for services
	that support TCP wrappers.</p>

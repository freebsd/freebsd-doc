	  <title>New website section: Projects and ideas for volunteers</title>

	  <p>The FreeBSD project has hundreds of active developers spread all
	    over the world, and many of them have their own parts of the
	    source-tree that they work on. However, there are always a lot of
	    new interesting projects and ideas that needs to be investigated
	    and evaluated, and this is where the FreeBSD project relies on
	    heroic efforts from volunteers.  A new section on the FreeBSD
	    website has been created with the purpose of listing such
	    projects.  The list is in no way complete, but it should serve as
	    a nice starting point for volunteers who would like to become
	    committers in the future.  You can <a

          <p>A new article, <a
              href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/building-products/">
	      Building Products with FreeBSD</a> describes the benefits of
            collaborating with the FreeBSD project when developing
            products.  Much of the engineering cost of software product
	    development for a successful product comes from the need to
 	    evolve to keep pace with the market.  By working with a mature,
	    reuse-friendly source base like that of the FreeBSD
	    project, and by following the best-practices listed in this article,
	    organizations can reap the benefits of reduced engineering costs
	    and improved market adaptability.</p>

	    Choosing the FreeBSD Version That Is Right For You</a>,
	    discusses considerations that should go into the selection
	    of the most suitable version of FreeBSD for individual needs.
	    Included are such concepts as the differences between a
	    Release and a Branch, and between FreeBSD-STABLE and
	    FreeBSD-CURRENT.  Also covered is how FreeBSD development
	    is moving towards a goal of more frequent major releases,
	    each of which introduces smaller feature sets, as compared
	    to how releases were done in the past.  The target audience
	    is both the user who is considering installing FreeBSD, and
	    also existing users who wish to plan their future upgrades.</p>

	  <title>Funded Student Projects Announced</title>

	  <p>The FreeBSD Project received over 350 applications for <a
	    href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google's
	    Summer of Code</a> program, amongst which 18 were selected
	    for funding. Unfortunately, there were far more first rate
	    applications than available spots for students.  However,
	    we encourage students to work together with us all year
	    round.  The FreeBSD Project is always willing to help
	    mentor students learn more about operating system
	    development through our normal community mailing lists and
	    development forums.  Contributing to an open source
	    software project is a valuable component of a computer
	    science education and great preparation for a career in
	    software development.</p>

	  <p>More information about the funded student projects is
	    available from the <a

    <h2>September 1998</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>15-Sep-98</b>
	September 15th is the scheduled date for entering BETA with the
	3.0-CURRENT tree.  As all of you already (should) know, 3.0 is
	scheduled for release on October 15th so this gives us a nice 30
	day BETA period.  During this time, I don't expect anyone to drop
	in significant new work or otherwise perturb the 3.0-CURRENT tree
	in such a way that violates the general idea of a BETA (you're
	supposed to test what you have, not move the goalposts every
	couple of days :).</p></li>

      <li><p><b>13-Sep-98</b>
	After more than a year of development, the Common Access Method
	SCSI layer for FreeBSD will be integrated into 3.0-CURRENT on
	Sunday, September 13th.  The CAM development team is currently
	busy ensuring that the integration process goes as smoothly as
	possible, so please understand that we may be slow to respond to
	questions about CAM during that time.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>09-Sep-98</b>
	Perl5 is now imported into the 3.0-CURRENT source
	tree.</p></li>

	put them on the list as well.</p></li>

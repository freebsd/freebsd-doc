<h3>FreeBSD Project announces FreeBSD 5.0</h3>

  <p><b>Berkeley, CA - January 20, 2003 - The FreeBSD Project</b> The
    FreeBSD Project announced today the availability of FreeBSD 5.0
    after almost three years of continuous development.  The latest
    version of the project's powerful open source operating system
    includes several ground breaking features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Multiprocessor support</b> has been extended and enhanced.
    We support SMP on all platforms, and have the infrastructure in
    place for extensive performance improvements.</li>

   <li><b>Background filesystem checks</b> offer quicker start up in
    disaster situations.</li>

  <li><b>File system snapshots</b> permit administrators to
    duplicate file systems in real time.</li>

  <li><b>Experimental support for Mandatory Access Controls (MAC)</b>
    provides an extensible and flexible means for administrators to
    define system security policies.</li>

  <li><b>Kernel Schedulable Entities</b> implement a high-performance
    many-to-many multiprocessor threading model.</li>

  <li><b>Expanded hardware support</b> now includes hardware
    cryptographic acceleration, ACPI, Bluetooth, and FireWire.</li>

</ul>

  <p>The release also includes new, reimplemented, and incremental
    improvements in areas where FreeBSD already dominates, such as
    network performance, stability, and reliability.</p>

  <p><cite>"This release represents our largest engineering success to
   date."</cite>, says Murray Stokely, Vice President of Engineering
   at FreeBSD Mall Inc and member of the FreeBSD Release Engineering
   Team.  <cite>" The new technologies present in FreeBSD 5.X will

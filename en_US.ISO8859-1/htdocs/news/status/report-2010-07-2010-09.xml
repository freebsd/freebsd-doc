    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This report covers &os;-related projects between July and
      September 2010.  It is the third of the four reports planned for
      2010.  During this period, we were victims of one
      of the biggest BSD events of the year &mdash; EuroBSDCon.
      We hope that the ones of you who have been able to attend it
      have enjoyed your stay.  Another good news is that work on the
      new minor versions of &os;, 7.4 and 8.2, is progressing well.</p>

    <p>This report, with 55 entries, is the longest report in
      the whole history and shows a good condition of the &os;
      community.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work!  We hope you
      enjoy reading it.</p>

    <p>Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
      between October and December 2010 is January 15th, 2011.</p>

	uses a 2.4GHz radio; 5GHz 11a mode has not been tested.  As with
	other Atheros chipset support in &os;, 11n support is not yet
	finished.  The current development platform is the TP-Link

	ext4 read-only mode is to make it possible to read ext4 file
	systems in read-only mode when the disk is formatted with
	default features.  Until now it can read data from ext4 file
	systems with default features in read-only mode.  A patch has

      <p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework
	and applications to the &os; operating system.</p>

      <p>Mono 2.8 has been released a few days ago and is already
	available in the BSD# repository.  The update breaks a few ports
	so the lang/mono update in the &os; ports tree will be delayed
	until those programs are fixed for a smoother update
	experience.</p>

      <p>Work is in progress to include some long-awaited ports such as
	deskutils/gnome-do but they require a lot of testing and hacking
	because they have clearly been designed to run on GNU/Linux and
	portability has never been a priority (which is quite amusing if
	you consider portability is the main reason to be for mono).</p>

      <p>We recently imported the 2.8 release of Clang into -CURRENT.
	This release contains many new features and improvements.  The
	integrated assembler ships with this version, but it is not
	ready for general use yet.</p>

      <p>Since r212979, all necessary changes have been committed to be
	able to build world with Clang, at least on amd64 and i386.  It
	can also be installed and run, and we are now starting the
	process of shaking out the inevitable bugs.</p>

      <p>Because LLVM and Clang are still being improved continuously,
	we want to import new versions regularly, approximately every two
	months, to gain access to new features, bug fixes and performance
	improvements.</p>

      <p>There is also an effort on behalf of the ports people, to make
	as many ports as possible compile and run properly with Clang.
	Most of the time, this means fixing the incorrect assumption that
	gcc is the only existing compiler, but sometimes more complicated
	issues pop up.  Help in this area is greatly appreciated.</p>

      <p>The goal of the project is to allow easier extension of base
	system tools by the ports system.  Ideally, no files in /etc
	should need to be modified by a port installation.</p>

      <p>The man toolset was recently reimplemented as a BSDL version
	instead of the old GPL version.  It is also a single shell script
	instead of multiple C programs.  Ports can extend the man
	functionality by dropping files into
	/usr/local/etc/man.d/portname.conf.</p>

      <p>Next up on the list is to finish the implementation for
	newsyslog thereby allowing ports that need logs rotated to take
	advantage of that tool.</p>

	Proof of concept (dirty) patch, removing some timer events.</url>

    <body>
      <p>Work on new event timers infrastructure continues.  In -CURRENT
	amd64, arm (Marvell), i386, mips, pc98, powerpc, sparc64, sun4v
	architectures were refactored to use new timers API.</p>

      <p>New machine-independent timers management code was written.  It
	can utilize both legacy periodic and new one-shot timer
	operation modes.</p>

      <p>Using one-shot mode allows to significantly reduce the number of
	timer interrupts and respectively increase CPU sleep time
	during idle periods.  Timer interrupts on idle CPUs are now
	generated only when they are needed to handle registered
	time-based events.  Busy CPUs unluckily still receive the full
	interrupt rate for purposes of resource accounting, scheduling
	and timekeeping.</p>

      <p>With some additional tuning it is now possible to have an
	8-core system, receiving only about 100 interrupts per second
	and respectively have CPU idle periods up to 100ms.  This
	allows to effectively use any supported CPU idle states
	(C-states), that reduces power consumption and increases effect
	of the Intel TurboBoost technology.</p>

      <p>New manual pages were written to document this functionality:
	eventtimers(7), attimer(4), atrtc(4), hpet(4).</p>

	below 1000 for the first time in quite a while.  This is very

      <p>We were happy to have more than 40 &os; developers and guests
	attending the &os; Developer Summit prior to EuroBSDCon&nbsp;2010
	in Karlsruhe, Germany.  This workshop-style event was hosted at
	Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and included prepared
	presentations in the morning, as well as group hacking and
	discussion sections in the afternoon.  We had various talks on
	several topics, covering the USB subsystem, state of the
	toolchain, the &os; documentation, NanoBSD improvements, &os;
	port of PF, jails, Virtual Private Systems, cooperation with the
	PC-BSD Project, FreeNAS, the new event timers subsystems,
	bugbusting discussions and Ports Tinderbox presentations, and
	many of this year's and last year's Google Summer of Code
	projects.  Photos, videos, and slides for most of the talks are

      <p>Apart from the constant bug fixing and adaptions to
	machine-independent changes that pretty much always take place,
	not much has happened in the area of sparc64 since the last
	status report.  The only noteworthy exception are some performance
	optimizations which take advantage of features of Fujitsu SPARC64
	CPUs.  These were a bit too risky for putting them in shortly
	before &os;&nbsp;8.1-RELEASE but will be part of 7.4-RELEASE and
	8.2-RELEASE now that they have received the necessary
	testing.</p>

      <p>Part of reasons why not much has happened in this spot was some
	lack of time on my side but also due to nobody showing up with a
	not yet supported sun4u machine lately and me delving in the
	network land instead, which yielded some things to report about
	in the next status report.  On the other hand I recently got a
	hold of a Sun Fire 3800, so these and other models from the same
	family likely will be supported by &os; at some point in the

      <p>Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD

	builds use the Clang compiler, Clang first compiled a non-debug
	build of Chromium, a very large C++ project, on &os;.  This
	porting effort employs a new hybrid-source model: portions of the
	latest &os; patches are kept closed for a limited time and new
	builds are made available only to paying subscribers, while older
	builds are eventually spun off to ports.  Further work remains to
	port all of Chromium to &os;, I am now porting the task manager

      <p>Work has commenced on a newly funded &os; Foundation project
	to bring six modular TCP congestion control (CC) algorithm
	implementations (the existing NewReno and five new algorithms:
	HTCP, CUBIC, Vegas, HD and CHD) to the &os; kernel.  See the
	CAIA 5cc and NewTCP websites for more details on the
	algorithms.</p>

      <p>To support the project's primary deliverable, we will also
	be incorporating the CAIA modular CC and Khelp frameworks into
	the &os; kernel, along with the Enhanced Round Trip Time Khelp
	module.</p>

      <p>The project will make a sizable, state-of-the-art
	contribution to &os; and in certain areas, add completely novel
	work unavailable in any other operating system known to us.</p>

      <p>We anticipate a number of benefits, including vastly
	improved researcher friendliness, reduced work for TCP oriented
	vendors of &os;-based appliances, and greater choice for system
	administrators who operate &os; systems in atypical network

      <p>The goal of this project is to implement resource containers
	and a simple per-jail resource limits mechanism.  Resource
	containers are also a prerequisite for other resource management
	mechanisms, such as Hierarchical Resource Limits, for "Collective
	Limits on Set of Processes (aka.  Jobs)" Google Summer of Code
	2010 project, for implementing mechanism similar to Linux
	cgroups, and might be also used to e.g. provide precise resource
	usage accounting for administrative or billing purposes.  So far,
	a generic resource usage framework has been developed, along with
	limit enforcement for most resources.  Work is on-going on adding
	limits for remaining resources, debugging and generally improving
	the implementation.  This project is being sponsored by The &os;
	Foundation.</p>

    <body>
      <p>During the previous few months several additions were
	developed to &os;'s built-in SNMP daemon &mdash; bsnmpd(1).</p>

      <p>First a snmp_wlan(3) module was developed that allows
	monitoring and configuration of wlan(4) interfaces operating in
	various modes, including statistics, attached/neighboring
	station information, MAC access control entries and mesh routing
	information.  The module's code was submitted in SVN and is now
	a part of the &os; base system.</p>

      <p>Next, SNMPv3 authentication and encryption support were added
	to bsnmplib(3), bsnmpd(1) and bsnmptools (which are available
	via the ports system currently).  The message digest and cipher
	calculation calls use the implementation of the relevant
	cryptographic algorithm implementation in OpenSSL's crypto(3)
	library.  bsnmpd(1) may still optionally be compiled without the
	crypto(3) library, in which case only unauthenticated plain-text
	SNMPv3 PDUs may be processed.</p>

      <p>In addition, a snmp_usm(3) module was developed that is used to
	configure SNMPv3 users parameters (name, authentication &amp;
	encryption algorithms used and relevant keys, etc.) into
	bsnmpd(1) as per RFC 3414.</p>

      <p>Finally, a snmp_vacm(3) module was developed that allows
	configuration of view-based access control as per RFC 3415, and
	relevant checks are made by bsnmpd(1) that allow or restrict
	access to specific SNMPv1/SNMPv2 communities or SNMPv3 users to
	certain MIB subtrees as per the configuration in the
	snmp_vacm(3) module.  If none of the SNMPv3-related modules is
	loaded, bsnmpd(1) preserves its current behavior with
	SNMPv1/SNMPv2c PDUs.</p>

      <p>&os; Services Control is a mix of binaries which integrate
	into the rc.d system and provide for service (daemon)
	monitoring.  It knows about signals, pidfiles, and uses very
	little resources.</p>

      <p>The fsc daemon (fscd) runs in the background once the system
	has started.  Services are then added to this daemon via the
	fscadm control utility and from there they will be monitored.
	When they die, depending on the reason, they will be restarted.
	Certain signals may be ignored (list not decided), and fscd
	will remove that service from monitoring.  Every action is
	logged to the system logging daemon.  Additionally, the fscadm
	utility may be used to inquire about what services are
	monitored, their pidfile location, and current process id.</p>

      <p>FSC provides several advantages over the third-party
	daemontools package.  For example, fscd uses push notifications
	instead of polling; fscd is an internal, &os;-maintained
	software package accessible to all developers where daemontools
	would have to be a port and require us to maintain patches;
	fscd could be easily integrated with the current rc.d
	infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Partially based on the ideas of daemontools and Solaris
	Service Management Facility (SMF), this could be an extremely
	useful tool for &os; systems.</p>

      <p>Since the last status report, two bugs have been fixed and
	the documentation has been updated.  In the coming weeks we hope
	to get more developer attention and review, perhaps even push
	to commit the code into &os;.</p>

      <p>One problem that the project has with its push towards
	embedded platforms is with the toolchain.  The compilers and
	linkers and such in the current &os; support the architectures
	generically, but often times silicon vendors produce specialized
	toolchains to wring the most performance out of their silicon.
	Right now, it is difficult to compile &os; with these tools, as
	many manual steps are required to make things 'just so'.</p>

      <p>The external toolchain project will leverage some of the work
	done by the Clang team to support Clang in the base system
	(breaking the strict dependency on CC=cc (except for the broken
	intel CC support)).  In addition, the orchestration of the build
	(make buildworld) will change to avoid bootstrapping certain
	tools, or compiling the compilers at all.  In addition, support
	for using alternate assemblers, linkers, etc., will be added.
	The work will be done in subversion in projects/xtc (for
	eXternal Tool Chain).</p>

      <p>The purpose of DAHDI/&os; project is to make it possible to
	use &os; as a base system for software PBX solutions.</p>

      <p>DAHDI (Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) is an
	open-source device driver framework and a set of hardware drivers
	for E1/T1, ISDN digital, and FXO/FXS analog cards [<a
	  href="http://www.asterisk.org/dahdi/">1</a>].
	Asterisk is one of the most popular open-source software PBX
	solutions [<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">2</a>].</p>

      <p>The project includes porting DAHDI framework and hardware
	drivers for E1/T1, FXO/FXS analog, and ISDN digital cards to
	&os;.  This also includes TDMoE support, software and hardware
	echo cancellation (Octasic, VPMADT032), and hardware transcoding
	support (TC400B).  The work is ongoing in the official DAHDI SVN
	repository with the close collaboration with DAHDI folks at
	Digium.</p>

      <p>DAHDI/&os; project is completed.  ports/misc/dahdi now contains
	the most recent DAHDI/&os; version and additional stuff that is
	not available in DAHDI/&os; SVN repository due to licensing and
	copyright restrictions (OSLEC echo canceler, experimental zaphfc
	driver).  Experimental sparc64 support is also implemented and is
	currently being tested.</p>

      <p>There is a pile of minor changes in queue that will be handled
	soon:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Add ability to run asterisk+dahdi under non-root user
	  account.</li>

	<li>Add support for bri_net_ptmp ISDN signalling to asterisk
	  port and drop old and outdated zaptel+asterisk-bristuff
	  ports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Periodic merges from DAHDI/Linux SVN will be continued on a
	regular basis with rolling out new DAHDI/&os; releases (most
	likely synchronized with DAHDI/Linux releases).</p>

	&os; port for the OpenAFS 1.5.77 release</url>
    </links>

    <body>
      <p>AFS is a distributed network file system that originated from
	the Andrew Project at Carnegie-Mellon University; the OpenAFS
	client implementation has not been particularly useful on &os;
	since the &os;&nbsp;4.X releases.  The previous status report
	brought the OpenAFS client to a useful form on -CURRENT,
	though with many rough edges.  Only a couple of those edges have
	been smoothed out during the past few months, as developer time
	was scarce.  A mismatch between file size and vmobject size
	tracking was resolved (allowing executables to be run from AFS),
	and our system call entry has been updated on -CURRENT and 8-STABLE
	to match reality.  Thanks to Kostik Belusov for both of those!
	The code is useful enough that we plan to submit an
	openafs-devel port to the Ports Collection in the coming
	cycle.</p>

      <p>There are several known outstanding issues that are being
	worked on, but detailed bug reports are welcome at
	port-freebsd@openafs.org.</p>

      <p>The gptboot now fully follows GPT specification (verifies
	checksums and falls back to backup header and table if primary is
	corrupted).</p>

      <p>One can now use new attributes to configure partition that

      <ul>
	<li>AES-XTS encryption.  XTS mode is a standard that is
	  recommended these days for storage encryption.  This is the
	  default now.  AES-XTS support was also added to opencrypto
	  framework and aesni(4) driver.</li>

	<li>Multiple encryption keys.  GELI will use one encryption key
	  for at most 2^20 blocks (sectors), as it is not recommended to
	  use the same encryption key for too much data.  It generates a key
	  array from the master key on attach and uses it accordingly.  This

    <body>
      <p>Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework
	developed at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,
	supported by a grant from Google.  Capsicum extends the POSIX API,
	providing several new OS primitives to support object-capability
	security on UNIX-like operating systems: capabilities, a new
	sandboxed capability mode for processes, anonymous shared memory
	objects, process descriptors, and a modified C runtime able to
	support distributed applications within sandboxes.  Capsicum
	has been prototyped on &os; -CURRENT, with a 8-STABLE
	backport.</p>

      <p>Capsicum is intended to supplement existing system-centric
	mandatory access control protections by providing an
	application-centric protection model, which better supports
	compartmentalised user programs that set up one (or many)
	sandboxes to process untrustworthy data in.  A number of
	applications, from tcpdump to the Chromium web browser, have been
	modified to use sandboxing to confine risky activities such as
	the parsing of untrusted packets and HTML/JavaScript
	rendering.</p>

      <p>We plan to begin merging the core Capsicum kernel features
	to &os; -CURRENT in November/December 2010 once a number of
	known problems have been resolved.  Following a KBI analysis, we
	will consider merging our 8-STABLE backport to Subversion.  For
	the time being, and while APIs stabilise, we plan to distribute
	the Capsicum libraries via ports.  However, simply having the
	kernel features in place is sufficient to support sandboxing in
	tcpdump and Chromium.</p>

      <p>The Capsicum paper by Robert Watson / Jonathan Anderson
	(Cambridge) and Ben Laurie / Kris Kennaway (Google) won a best
	paper award at the 2010 USENIX Security Symposium!</p>

      <p>The bugbusting team continue work on trying to make the contents
	of the GNATS PR database cleaner, more accessible and easier for
	committers to find and resolve PRs, by tagging PRs to indicate the
	areas involved, and by ensuring that there is sufficient info
	within each PR to resolve each issue.</p>

      <p>July saw the addition of Alexander Best (arundel@) to this
	bugbusting team, he is helping with the triaging PRs as they come
	in, creating patches for problems and working with submitters to
	get the solutions tested, and working through the PR backlog.</p>

      <p>Also in July, Gavin Atkinson worked with Hans Petter Selasky on
	the USB PRs, attempting to go through many of them and determine
	the status of each of them.  As a result, nearly 10% of the USB
	PRs were determined to be closeable, with many more either being
	marked as patched already or able to be committed quickly.
	Several PRs that only affect the old (pre-8.0) USB stack were
	also identified and marked as such.  More work will take place
	in this area in the future.</p>

      <p>August saw us host another bugathon, with an aim of
	investigating and getting into a committable state several of the
	PRs with patches.  Turnout was not as great as in the past
	&mdash; mainly believed to be due to the short notice, but still
	several PRs were progressed, with several commits made and
	several PRs closed.</p>

      <p>The number of PRs has held steady over the last three months,
	with improvements in numbers in some categories (especially usb
	and bin) being offset by slight increases in others.</p>

      <p>Reports continue to be produced from the PR database, all of
	which can be found from the links above.  Committers interested
	in custom reports are encouraged to discuss requirements with
	bugmeister@ &mdash; we are happy to create new reports where
	needs are identified.</p>

      <p>As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
	welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet.  We are
	always looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in
	triaging incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing
	problems, or simply helping with the database housekeeping
	(identifying duplicate PRs, ones that have already been resolved,
	etc).  This is a great way of getting more involved with
	&os;!</p>

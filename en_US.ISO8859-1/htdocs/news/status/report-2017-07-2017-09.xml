    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This quarter's &os; developments continue to provide
      excitement and promise for further developments.  I myself
      have a soft spot for manual pages, so it is especially good to
      see that we have gained some documentation for writing them
      (and I hope that this will translate to more and improved
      manual pages in the future!).  The core@ entry is also of
      particular note, with the introduction of the FCP process and
      the recognition of the first non-committer &os; Project Member
      (and more).  Read on to find out more about these, as well as
      improved support for the AMD Zen family of processors (e.g.,
      Ryzen), and a whole lot more!</p>

      <p>This quarter, a bit of work was done to enhance platform
	support for AMD Zen (Ryzen, Threadripper, Epyc) processors:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The CPU topology detection code was enhanced to properly
	  detect Zen dies and CPU Complexes.  This gives the scheduler more
	  locality information to use when making scheduling decisions.</li>

	<li>The x86 topology analysis was enhanced to report dies and
	  CPU Complexes, in addition to the existing reporting on packages,
	  cores, and threads.  An example of the new output is
	  <tt>FreeBSD/SMP: 1 package(s) x 2 groups x 2 cache groups
	    x 4 core(s) x 2 hardware threads</tt>.</li>

	<li>The amdsmn(4) driver for accessing SMN (System Management
	  Network) registers was added.</li>

	<li>CPU temperature monitoring support for Zen was added to
	  amdtemp(4).</li>

	<li>In cpufreq(4):
	  <ul>
	    <li>Added support for decoding Zen P-state information
	      from Machine State Registers (which is usually not
	      necessary, since it is largely redundant with ACPI
	      P-state information, but is potentially useful)</li>

	    <li>Work around the apparent Ryzen inability to achieve
	      the P1 state by not busying cores waiting to
	      transition to it</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>The intpm(4) smbus driver was fixed to attach to the AMD
	  FCH (Fusion Controller Hub).</li>

	<li>All MCA banks are now enabled and monitored on Zen
	  CPUs.</li>

	<li>Feature-bit decoding was added for: CLZERO, SVM features,
	  and RAS capabilities.</li>

	<li>SHA intrinsic support was added to the aesni(4) driver.
	  Ryzen is currently the only desktop processor to feature
	  these intrinsics.  Support for these intrinsics is also
	  present in Intel's Goldmont line of low-end SoCs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall, Zen is now a very usable platform for x86
	workstations and servers.</p>

      <p>This summer has seen the creation of a puppet@ team to help
	maintain the approximately 30 Puppet-related ports in the &os;
	Ports Collection.
	These ports were previously maintained by various committers,
	and from time to time the distributed maintainership
	introduced some delays when
	updating a port, due to the need to wait for a maintainer's
	approval for a related change to a different port.</p>

      <p>Puppet 5 is now in the ports tree (as
	<tt>sysutils/puppet5</tt>).  The C++ version of Facter
	(<tt>sysutils/facter</tt>) got a lot of attention and is now a
	drop-in replacement for the previous Ruby version
	(<tt>sysutils/rubygem-facter</tt>); it is the default facts
	source for the Puppet 5 port.</p>

      <p>The Ports Collection now features over 31,600 ports.  There are currently
	2671 problem reports, of which 718 are unassigned.  This quarter saw
	almost 5,900 commits from 175 committers.  The number of open PRs grew
	compared to last quarter, and outpaced the number of changes.</p>

      <p>This quarter, we welcomed Zach Leslie (zleslie@), Luca Pizzamiglio
	(pizzamig@), Craig Leres (leres@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), and Dave
	Cottlehuber (dch@) as new committers.  The commit bits of the following
	committers were taken in for safekeeping: alonso@ after 19 months of
	inactivity, rpaulo@ per his request, and ache@ after he passed away.
	Despite several tries and changing mentors, kami@ lacked interest in
	completing his mentorship, so his commit bit was also taken in for
	safekeeping.</p>

      <p>On the infrastructure side, two <tt>USES</tt> values were
	removed because they outlived their usefulness:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>execinfo</tt>: <tt>libexecinfo</tt> is now available in the
	  base system of all supported &os; versions</li>

	<li><tt>twisted</tt>: there is only one Twisted port left</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The default version of GCC was bumped from 5 to 6.  Firefox was updated
	to version 56.0 and Chromium to version 61.0.3163.100.  The version of
	<tt>pkg</tt> itself was updated to 1.10.1.</p>

      <p>During this quarter, antoine@ performed 28 exp-runs to test version
	updates of major ports, improving <tt>USE_GITHUB</tt> and
	<tt>SHEBANG_FILES</tt>, and API changes to the base system.
	This quarter, the foundation for ports &quot;flavors&quot; was
	committed, though more development and testing will be
	performed in the coming quarter before it goes live.</p>

    <title>The &os; Core Team</title>

      <p>The new &quot;&os; Community Process&quot; was drafted during BSDCan
	earlier this year.  The first such document, FCP 0, defines how
	the whole process works.  After some time for discussion and
	revision, FCP 0 was voted on and accepted by core, following the
	procedure laid down within that document.  Currently the use of FCPs
	is entirely optional; we shall see how the community begins to
	adopt their usage and evolve the process based on experience.</p>

      <p>A draft update to the Code of Conduct has been prepared by the
	advisory committee.  Core is currently reviewing the text, and
	will soon vote on accepting it.  Core is keen to avoid the trap of
	&quot;rules lawyering&quot;.  At the moment, the feeling is
	that we need to add a preamble to the CoC to articulate the
	goals of the project and to act as a general guide to the
	exercise of the code.</p>

      <p>This quarter has been quite a busy one concerning changes to
	the roster of committers and project members.  We have elected our
	first new Project Member: John Hixson, who will be familiar from
	many conferences where he has given presentations and ably
	represented iXsystems.  A second proposed Project Member was not
	accepted by core, but only because core felt that Fedor Uporov
	really deserved a commit bit instead.</p>

      <p>In addition to Fedor Uporov, please also welcome (in no
	particular order) Matt Joras, Marcin Wojtas, Chuck Tuffli, Ilya
	Bakulin and Alex Richardson as brand-new committers.  We have also
	awarded Steven Hurd and Eugene Grosbein src commit bits to go with
	their existing ports bits.  Welcome back Gordon Tetlow as a src
	committer, essential for his new role within secteam.  Eric Davis
	and Rui Paulo have both decided to hang up their commit bits: we
	wish them well in their future endeavours.  Finally, we must
	report the sad death of Andrey Chernov, who will be sorely missed
	by his colleagues and collaborators.</p>

      <p>Andrey's death has highlighted another question which is only
	going to become more complex over time.  Keeping track of
	copyrights is already hard enough within a mature source tree with
	many contributors, such as the &os; sources.  Now we need to
	consider trying to keep track of the heirs and beneficiaries of
	contributors who have sadly passed away.  Core will consult with
	the Foundation legal team to discuss possible approaches to
	alleviate this.</p>

      <p>There have been complaints that the workings of Core are being
	kept overly confidential, and that consequently the majority of
	the project has too little idea of what is going on.  This is
	certainly not intentional by Core, and we are keen to open up
	Core's business to more general community scrutiny as far as seems
	reasonable.</p>

      <p>Core dealt with a number of licensing questions:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>When upstreaming patches and other original works to
	  VirtualBox or other Oracle properties, pragmatically it works
	  best to provide them under the terms of the MIT license (one
	  of two opensource licenses accepted by Oracle).  Of course,
	  this only applies to work upstreamed by or with the permission
	  of the original author.</li>

	<li>The Viking software license is sufficiently BSD-like that
	  magic constants from their drivers can be used in &os;
	  code.</li>

	<li>There is no separate register of deviations from the allowed
	  BSD-like licenses in the source tree: any code in the tree
	  under other than BSD-like license terms can be assumed to have
	  been approved by core.</li>

	<li>At the moment the &os; copyright requirement to include
	  the copyright notice in redistributions in binary form is
	  satisfied by making the &os; sources, with all of the
	  detailed copyright information included in the different source
	  code files, available alongside pre-compiled system images.
	  However, this does not necessarily meet the needs of downstream
	  projects based on &os;, and given the new "packaged base",
	  adding per-package licensing metadata in a way similar to how
	  the Ports Collection works is under consideration as an alternative
	  mechanism.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Concerns were raised regarding the pending HardenedBSD entry in the
	previous quarterly report prior to publication.  The &os;
	project welcomes reports from separate (but derived) projects in
	quarterly reports and has included similar reports in the past
	from other projects (such as TrueOS and pfSense).  The HardenedBSD
	report was edited for length and to concentrate on activities
	during the quarter in question.</p>

      <p>Amazon is proposing to set up mirrors of the <tt>freebsd-update</tt> and
	<tt>pkg</tt> servers within AWS in order to provide faster
	access for EC2 users.  These mirrors will be publicly
	accessible, but the expectation is that use will primarily be
	from within EC2.  &os; AMIs will have a preset configuration
	that references the Amazon servers.</p>

      <p>The old, long-deprecated, and insecure &quot;r-commands&quot;
        (<tt>rsh</tt>, <tt>rlogin</tt>, <tt>rcp</tt>) are being removed
	from the base system for
	12.0-RELEASE.  Notice of this was added to the man pages and
	release notes in time for 11.1-RELEASE and 10.4-RELEASE.  Anyone
	requiring these commands for backwards compatibility can use the
	new <tt>net/bsdrcmds</tt> port.</p>

      <p>Work to replace Heimdal Kerberos in base with the more widely
	compatible MIT Kerberos has begun in a new
	<tt>projects/krb5</tt> branch.  This should not fall afoul of
	any US cryptography export regulations: the project is
	required to notify the US government that cryptographic
	software can be downloaded from &os; servers, and this already
	covers MIT Kerberos, already available within ports.</p>

      <p>A number of Bay Area &os; User Group-related domain names
	are being given up by their original owner.  The current BAFUG
	organisers have been made aware.</p>

      <p>Core has voted on a change to the Doceng voting rules to
	provide for a &quot;did not vote&quot; status during doceng
	voting similar to how portmgr and core voting operates.  The
	current requirement for all five members of doceng to register
	a vote on issues was proving to be a significant
	bottleneck.</p>

      <body>
	<p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
	  organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the
	  &os; Project and community worldwide.  Funding comes from
	  individual and corporate donations and is used to fund and
	  manage software development projects, conferences and
	  developer summits, and provide travel grants to &os;
	  contributors.  The Foundation purchases and supports hardware
	  to improve and maintain &os; infrastructure and provides
	  full-time Release Engineering support; publishes marketing
	  material to promote, educate, and advocate for the &os;
	  Project; facilitates collaboration between commercial
	  vendors and &os; developers; and finally, represents the
	  &os; Project in executing contracts, license agreements,
	  and other legal arrangements that require a recognized legal
	  entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help &os; last
	quarter:</p>

      <p>Fundraising Efforts</p>

      <p>Our work is 100% funded by your donations.  This year we have
	raised over $860,000 from over 500 donors.  Our 2017 fundraising
	goal is $1,250,00 and we are continuing to work hard to meet
	and exceed this goal!  Please consider making a donation to
	help us continue and increase our support for &os;: <a
	  href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/">https://www.&os;foundation.org/donate/</a>.</p>

      <p>We also have a new Partnership Program, to provide more benefits
	for our larger commercial donors.  Find out more information at
	<a
	  href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/">https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/</a>
	and share with your companies!</p>

      <p>OS Improvements</p>

      <p>The Foundation improves the &os; operating system by
	employing our technical staff to maintain and improve critical
	kernel subsystems, add features and functionality, and fix
	problems.  This also includes funding separate project grants
	like the arm64 port, <tt>blacklistd</tt> access control
	daemon, and the integration of VIMAGE support, to make sure
	that &os; remains a viable solution for research,
	education, computing, products and more.</p>

      <p>We kicked off or continued the following projects last
	quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>OpenZFS RAID-Z Expansion project</li>

	<li>Broadcom Wi-Fi infrastructural improvements
	  (<tt>bhnd(4)</tt> driver)</li>

	<li>Headless mode out-of-the-box for the Beaglebone Black</li>

	<li>Extending <tt>bhyve</tt>/ARMv7 features</li>

	<li>Porting <tt>bhyve</tt>/ARM to an ARMv8 platform</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Having software developers on staff has allowed us to jump in
	and work directly on projects to improve &os; like:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>ZFS improvements</li>

	<li>New Intel server support</li>

	<li><tt>kqueue(2)</tt> updates</li>

	<li>64-bit inode support</li>

	<li>Stack guard</li>

	<li>Kernel Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</li>

	<li>Toolchain projects</li>

	<li><tt>i915</tt> driver investigation</li>

	<li>NVDIMM support in <tt>acpiconf(8)</tt></li>

	<li>Continuous integration dashboard (web page and physical
	  hardware)</li>

	<li>FAT filesystem support in makefs(8)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Staff and board members continued hosting bi-weekly
	conference calls to facilitate efforts for individuals to
	collaborate on different technologies.</p>

      <p>Release Engineering</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member to lead the
	release engineering efforts.  This has provided timely and
	reliable releases over the last few years.</p>

      <p>Last quarter, our full-time staff member worked with the
	&os; Release Engineering and Security Teams to finalize
	11.1-RELEASE.  He also supported the 10.4 release effort, and
	has continued producing 10-STABLE, 11-STABLE, and 12-CURRENT
	development snapshot builds throughout the quarter.  At the
	vBSDCon Developer Summit, he gave a presentation on the state
	of the release engineering team.</p>

      <p>You can find out more about the support we provided to the
	Release Engineering Team by reading their status update in
	this report.</p>

      <p>Supporting &os; Infrastructure</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve the
	&os; infrastructure.  Last quarter, we continued supporting
	&os; hardware located around the world.</p>

      <p>&os; Advocacy and Education</p>

      <p>A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for
	the Project.  This includes promoting work being done by
	others with &os;; producing advocacy literature to teach
	people about &os; and help make the path to starting using
	&os; or contributing to the Project easier; and attending
	and getting other &os; contributors to volunteer to run
	&os; events, staff &os; tables, and give &os;
	presentations.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and
	summits around the globe.  These events can be BSD-related,
	open source, or technology events geared towards
	underrepresented groups.  We support the &os;-focused events
	to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to work
	together on projects, and to facilitate collaboration
	between developers and commercial users.  This all helps
	provide a healthy ecosystem.  We support the non-&os; events
	to promote and raise awareness of &os;, to increase the use
	of &os; in different applications, and to recruit more
	contributors to the Project.</p>

      <p>Here is a list highlighting some of the advocacy and
	education work we did last quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Organized and ran the Essen &os; Hackathon in Essen
	  Germany</li>

	<li>Sponsored and participated in the &os; Developer Summit
	  BSDCam, in Cambridge, England</li>

	<li>Represented &os; at the ARM Partner Meeting</li>

	<li>Presented and taught about &os; at SdNOG 4 in Khartoum,
	  Sudan</li>

	<li>Sponsored and gave presentations and tutorials at
	  EuroBSDCon in Paris, France</li>

	<li>Organized and ran the Paris &os; Developer Summit</li>

	<li>Organized and ran the &os; Developer Summit at vBSDCon</li>

	<li>Sponsored and attended vBSDCon</li>

	<li>Proved travel grants to &os; contributors to attend the
	  above events.</li>

	<li>Sponsored the 2017 USENIX Security Symposium in Vancouver
	  BC as an Industry Partner</li>

	<li>Provided &os; advocacy material</li>

	<li>Sponsored the 2017 USENIX Annual Technical Conference in
	  Santa Clara, CA as an Industry Partner</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We continued producing &os; advocacy material to help
	people promote &os; around the world.</p>

      <p>We help educate the world about &os; by publishing the
	professionally produced &os; Journal.  Last quarter we
	published the July/August issue that you can find at <a
	  href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/journal/">https://www.&os;foundation.org/journal/</a>.</p>

      <p>You can find out more about events we attended and upcoming
	events at <a
	  href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/news-and-events/">https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/news-and-events/</a>.</p>

      <p>Legal/&os; IP</p>

      <p>The Foundation owns the &os; trademarks, and it is our
	responsibility to protect them.  We also provide legal support
	for the core team to investigate questions that arise.</p>

      <p>A pNFS server allows an NFS service to be spread over
	multiple servers, separating the MetaData operations from the
	Data operations (Read and Write).  This project will add the
	ability to use &os; systems to create a pNFS service
	consisting of a single MetaData Server plus a set of Data
	Servers.  The Data Servers can be mirrored, so that redundant
	copies of the file data are maintained.</p>

      <p>The support for non-mirrored Data Servers is now believed
	to be complete.  Support for mirrored Data Servers using the
	Flexible File Layout, which will soon be published as an RFC,
	is implemented.  However, there is still significant work to
	be done, since the current implementation of mirrored Data
	Servers does not handle failed Data Servers or their
	resilvering/recovery.  It is hoped that support for
	failure/recovery of Data Servers will be implemented in the
	next six months.</p>

      <p>The patched &os; sources may now be accessed for testing
	via either Subversion or downloading a gzipped tarball.
	They consist of a patched kernel and <tt>nfsd</tt> and can be
	used on any &os; 11 or later system.  The installation
	procedure is covered in the linked document.</p>

    <body>
      <p>The <tt>nosh</tt> project is a suite of system-level utilities for
	initializing, running, and shutting down BSD systems; and for
	managing daemons, terminals, and logging.  It attempts to
	supersede BSD <tt>init</tt>, the Mewburn <tt>rc.d</tt> system,
	and OpenRC as used on &os; and TrueOS, drawing inspiration
	from Solaris SMF for named milestones, daemontools-encore for
	service control/status mechanisms, UCSPI, and IBM AIX for
	separated service and system management.  It includes a range
	of compatibility mechanisms, including shims for familiar
	commands from other systems, and an automatic import mechanism
	that takes existing configuration data from
	<tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, <tt>/etc/rc.conf{,.local}</tt>,
	<tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, and elsewhere, applying them to its native
	service definitions and creating additional native services.
	It is portable (including to Linux) and composable, it
	provides a migration path from the world of <tt>systemd</tt> Linux, and
	it does not require new kernel APIs.  It provides clean
	service environments, orderings and dependencies between
	services, parallelized startup and shutdown (including
	<tt>fsck</tt>), strictly size-capped and autorotated logging,
	the service manager as a &quot;subreaper&quot;, and uses
	<tt>kevent(2)</tt> for event-driven parallelism.</p>

      <p>Since the last status report, in December 2015, the project
	has seen: restructured and finer-grained packaging that has
	fewer conflicts with other toolsets; the addition of
	<tt>zsh</tt> completion files; improvements to the virtual
	terminal subsystem, keyboard map, mouse support, and ugen and
	DECSCUSR support; RFC 5424/5426 remote logging support;
	replacement of libkqueue and the C library's environment
	handling functions; several new helper commands; support for
	Java VM autolocation; improved socket-passing code; an
	extended status API and &quot;one-shot&quot; service support;
	additional pre-supplied service bundles; support for service
	aliases; improved handling of per-user D-Bus services;
	improved importing of MySQL, MariaDB, Percona, and OpenVPN
	services; improved configuration import support; and extensive
	additions to the <tt>nosh</tt> Guide.</p>

      <p>On the recently updated roadmap you can see plans for even
	more documentation, continuing the work to extend the
	capabilities of the networking subsystem, and the scant
	handful of <tt>rc.d</tt>-related items remaining.  There are
	also some ideas still in the speculative or planning phases,
	including work that may depend on incorporating <tt>nosh</tt>
	support into other software.</p>

      <p>Over the last year, interest has increased in manual pages, in
	large part due to excellent infrastructure work by Baptiste
	Daroussin and others, and promotion by George Neville-Neil and
	others.  This increased interest has been both gratifying and
	problematic.  Our man pages are underappreciated gems, but we
	have sadly lacked any substantial documentation on how to write
	new ones.</p>

      <p>In September, I added a new chapter to the
	<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/">&os;
	  Documentation Project Primer</a> describing the basics of
	creating a man page.  It includes descriptions of the
	markup, section structure, recommended optional material
	such as examples, and sample templates for the most common
	types of man pages.  The Resources section includes links to
	several external resources, including the excellent <a
	href="http://manpages.bsd.lv/mdoc.html">Practical UNIX
	Manuals: mdoc</a>.</p>

      <p>While this chapter is not a full tutorial, it does begin to fill

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p><strong>This is a draft of the April-June 2014 status report.
	Please check back after it is finalized, and an announcement
	email is sent to the FreeBSD-Announce mailing
	list.</strong></p>

    <p>This report covers &os;-related projects between April and
      June 2014.  This is the second of four reports planned for
      2014.</p>

    <?ignore
    <p>The first quarter of 2014 was, again, a hectic and
      productive time for &os;.  The Ports team released their
      landmark first quarterly <q>stable</q> branch.  &os; continues
      to grow on the ARM architecture, now running on an ARM-based
      Chromebook.  SMP is now possible on multi-core ARM systems.
      bhyve, the native &os; hypervisor, continues to improve.  An
      integral test suite is taking shape, and the Jenkins Continuous
      Integration system has been implemented.  &os; patches to GCC
      are being <q>forward-ported</q>, and LLDB, the Clang/LLVM
      debugger is being ported.  Desktop use has also seen
      improvements, with work on Gnome, KDE, Xfce, KMS video drivers,
      X.org, and <tt>vt</tt>, the new console driver which supports
      KMS and Unicode.  Linux and Wine binary compatibility layers
      have been improved.  UEFI booting support has been merged to
      head.  The &os; Foundation continues to assist in moving &os;
      forward, sponsoring conferences and meetings and numerous
      development projects.  And these are only some of the things
      that happened! Read on for even more.</p>
    ?>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work!  This
      report contains 20 entries and we hope you enjoy reading it.</p>

    <p>The deadline for submissions covering between July and
      September 2014 is October 7th, 2014.</p>

      <p>The so-called "CUSE4BSD" has been imported into the base
	system of &os;-11.  CUSE is short for character device in
	userspace.  The CUSE library is a wrapper for the devfs(8)
	kernel functionality which is exposed through /dev/cuse.  In
	order to function, the CUSE kernel code must either be enabled
	in the kernel configuration file or loaded separately as
	a module.  Follow the commit message link to get more

    <title>RPC/NFS and CTL/iSCSI Performance Optimizations</title>

    <body>
      <p>The &os; RPC stack, used as a base for its NFS server, received
	multiple optimizations to improve performance and SMP
	scalability.  Algorithmic optimizations reduced
	processing overhead, while improved locking allowed it to
	scale up to at least 40 processor cores without significant
	lock congestion.  Combined with some other kernel
	optimizations, the peak NFS request rate increased
	by many times, reaching up to 600K requests per second on
	modern hardware.</p>

      <p>The CAM Target Layer (CTL), used as base for new kernel iSCSI
	server, also received a series of locking optimizations which allowed
	its peak request rate to increase from ~200K to ~600K IOPS
	with the potential of reaching a rate of 1M requests per second.
	That rate is sufficient to completely saturate 2x10Gbit
	Ethernet links with 4KB requests.  For comparison, the port of
	net/istgt (user-level iSCSI server) on the same hardware with
	an equivalent configuration showed only 100K IOPS.</p>

      <p>There is also ongoing work on improving CTL functionality.
	It was already made to support three of four VMware VAAI storage
	acceleration primitives (net/istgt supports 2), while the goal
	is to reach full VAAI support during next months.</p>

      <p>With all these improvements, and earlier improvements in CAM, GEOM, ZFS,
	and a number of other kernel areas coming soon, FreeBSD 10.1 may
	become the fastest storage release ever.  ;)</p>

      <p>Arm64 is the name of the in-progress port of &os; to the
	ARMv8 CPU when it is in AArch64 mode.  Until recently, all ARM
	CPU designs were 32-bit only.  With the introduction of the
	ARMv8 architecture, ARM has added a new 64-bit mode.  This new
	mode has been named AArch64.</p>

      <p>Booting &os; on the ARM Foundation Model has made a lot of
	progress since the last status report.  An initial pmap
	implementation has been written.  With this, &os; is able to
	enter the Machine Independent boot code.  The required
	autoconf functions have been added allowing &os; to start
	scheduling tasks.  Finally the cpu_switch and copystr
	functions were added.  With these two, &os; will boot to the
	mountroot prompt.</p>

      <p>Work has started on supporting exceptions, including
	interrupts.  This will allow more developers to start
	working on device drivers.</p>

      <p>The <tt>vt(4)</tt> (aka <tt>Newcons</tt>) project provides
	a replacement for the legacy <tt>syscons</tt> system console.
	It brings a number of improvements, including better
	integration with graphics modes and broader character set
	support.</p>

      <p>Since the last <a
	  href="http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2014-01-2014-03.html#Updated-vt%284%29-System-Console">report</a>,
	<tt>vt(4)</tt> gained the ability to make early driver selection.
	<tt>vt(4)</tt> selects the best successfully-probed driver before
	most other kernel subsystems.  Also, to make easy migration from
	<tt>syscons(4)</tt> to <tt>vt(4)</tt>, multiple virtual
	terminal subsystems in the kernel are now supported.  It is
	controlled by a small module with just one kernel environment
	variable.  Users can select the virtual terminal system to use by setting <tt>kern.vty=sc</tt> or
	<tt>kern.vty=vt</tt>.</p>

      <p>The GENERIC kernel configuration for the amd64 and i386
	platforms now includes both <tt>syscons(4)</tt> and <tt>vt(4)</tt>
	by default.  This configuration is also planned to be in the
	next 10-STABLE release and &os;&nbsp;10.1-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>The project finally received a man page, so now <tt>vt(4)</tt> is not
	only the project name, but also a link to its documentation.  Great
	thanks to &a.wblock; for that.</p>

      <p>Major highlights:</p>

      <p>The <tt>ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel</tt> port is aware of how to build
	ports via an emulator.  Configuration of the miscellaneous
	binary image activator is required prior to a poudriere-devel
	run.</p>

      <p>ARMV6, MIPS32 and MIPS64 packages can be produced via full
	emulation.  There are several packages that block a full run
	of builds.  They can be viewed on the "Status of ports building"
	link.</p>

      <p>On current or latest stable/10:</p>

      <p>Clone the <url
	  href="https://github.com/seanbruno/qemu-bsd-user">github</url>
	repository of qemu, and switch to the bsd-user branch.  Then
	run:</p>

      <p><tt>./configure --static \<br/>
	  --target-list="arm-bsd-user i386-bsd-user \<br/>
	  mips-bsd-user mips64-bsd-user mips64el-bsd-user \<br/>

      <p><tt>gmake; gmake install</tt></p>

      <p>Then set up the <tt>binmiscctl</tt> tools to do some evil hackery to
	redirect execution of armv6 binaries to qemu:</p>

      <p><tt>binmiscctl add armv6 --interpreter \
	  "/usr/local/bin/qemu-arm" --magic \
	  "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02 \<br/>

      <p>Install poudriere-devel from ports.  It knows how to set up
	things.</p>

      <p>Build poudriere jail to do all the magic:</p>

      <p><tt>poudriere jail -c -j 11armv632 -m svn -a armv6 \<br/>
	  -v head</tt></p>

      <p>Now run poudriere against that jail to build all the
	ports:</p>

      <p><tt>poudriere bulk -j 11armv632 -a</tt></p>

      <p>Nullfs mount the ports tree into the jail:</p>

      <p><tt>mkdir /usr/local/poudriere/jails/11armv632/usr/ports<br/>
	  mount -t nullfs /usr/ports /usr/local/poudriere/jails/11armv632/usr/ports</tt></p>

      <p>We are pleased to announce the availability of conflict-free
	Python package support across different Python versions based
	on the USES=uniquefiles feature recently introduced to the
	Ports framework.  A Python package can be marked as buildable
	and installable in parallel for different Python versions at
	the same time on the same host.  The package building tools,
	however, do not support this feature yet and the Python team
	will work closely with portmgr and pkg developers to enable
	support on a global ports and package scale.</p>

      <p>In May and June a huge clean-up operation took place to
	remove the last bits and pieces targeting easy_install.  In
	the beginning of July we committed the final changes to remove
	easy_install support completely from the ports framework.
	This greatly simplifies the infrastructure and allows us to
	modernize and maintain it with less effort.</p>

      <p>We added Python 3.4, removed Python 3.1 after its end of
	life, updated the setuptools ports to version 5.1 and PyPy's
	development version to 2.3.1. The latest Python 2.7.8 and an
	updated setuptools will hit the tree shortly.</p>

      <p>Our upstreaming effort continues to produce good outcomes for
	simplifying maintenance and reducing complexity.</p>

      <p>Looking forward, one of the top priorities is to comply with
	the USES framework in the foreseeable future and to roll out a
	consistent maintainer policy for integrating new

      <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides
	boot- and run-time services for x86 and other computers.  For
	the x86 architecture it replaces the legacy BIOS.  This
	project will adapt the &os; loader and kernel boot process for
	compatibility with UEFI firmware, found on contemporary
	servers, desktops, and laptops.</p>

      <p>Ed and Nathan completed a number of integration tasks over
	the past three months.  Nathan added a first-stage loader,
	boot1.efi, to support chain-loading the rest of the system
	from a UFS filesystem.  This allows the UEFI boot process to
	proceed in a similar fashion as with BIOS boot.  Nathan also
	added UEFI support to the &os; installer and release image
	creation script.</p>

      <p>The EFI framebuffer requires the vt(4) system console &mdash;
	a framebuffer driver is not implemented for the legacy
	syscons(4) console.  Ed added automatic vt(4) selection to the
	UEFI boot path.</p>

      <p><url

      <p>The &os; Core Team constitutes the project's "Board of
	Directors", responsible for deciding the project's overall
	goals and direction as well as managing specific areas of the
	&os; project landscape.</p>

      <p>Topics for core this quarter have included some far-reaching
	policy reviews and some significant changes to the project
	development methodology.</p>

      <p>In May, a new release policy was published and
	presented at the BSDCan developer conference by John Baldwin.
	The idea is that each major release branch (for example, 10.X) is
	guaranteed to be supported for at least five years, but
	individual point releases on each branch, like 10.0-RELEASE,
	will be issued at regular intervals and only the latest point
	release will be supported.</p>

      <p>Another significant change did not receive approval.  When
	the change to the Bylaws reforming the core team election
	process was put to the vote of all &os; developers, it failed
	to reach a quorum.</p>

      <p>June saw the culmination of a long running project to replace
	the project's bug tracking system.  As of June 3, the &os;
	project has switched to Bugzilla as its bug tracking system.
	All of the history of GNATS PRs has been preserved, so there
	is no need to re-open old tickets.  Work is still going on to
	replicate some of the integration tweaks that had been applied
	to GNATS, but all necessary functionality has been implemented
	and the project is already seeing the benefits of the new
	capabilities brought by Bugzilla.</p>

      <p>An election to select core members for the next two year term
	of office took place during this period.  We would like to
	thank retiring members of core for their years of service.
	The new core team provides continuity with previous core
	teams: about half are incumbents from the previous team, and
	several former core team members have returned after a hiatus.
	Core now includes two members of the &os; Foundation board and
	one other Foundation staff member, aiding greater coordination
	at the top level of the project.  At the same time the
	core-secretary role was passed on to a new volunteer.</p>

      <p>Other activities included providing consultation on licensing
	terms for software within the &os; source tree, and oversight
	of changes to the membership of postmaster and clusteradm.</p>

      <p>Three new src commit bits were issued during this quarter,
	and one was taken into safekeeping.</p>

      <p>OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large
	pools of compute, storage, and networking resources in
	a datacenter.</p>

      <p>OpenContrail is a network virtualization (SDN) solution
	comprising network controller, virtual router, and analytics
	engine, which can be integrated with cloud orchestration
	systems like OpenStack or CloudStack.</p>

      <p>This work's goal is to enable &os; as a fully supported
	compute host for OpenStack using OpenContrail virtualized
	networking. The main areas of development are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Libvirt hypervisor driver for bhyve.</li>
	<li>Support for bhyve (via libvirt compute driver) and &os;
	  platform in overall in nova-compute.</li>
	<li>OpenContrail vRouter (forwarding plane kernel module) port
	  to &os;.</li>
	<li>OpenContrail Agent (network controller node) port to
	  &os;.</li>
	<li>Integration, performance optimizations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Since the last report the following items have been
	completed, which allow for a working demo of OpenStack compute
	node on a &os; host using OpenContrail solution for network
	virtualization:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Port of the OpenContrail vRouter kernel module for &os;
	  (MPLS over GRE mode only)</li>
	<li>Port of the OpenContrail Agent for &os;</li>
	<li>&os; version of a Devstack installation/configuration
	  script with support for the OpenContrail solution (Compute
	  node components only)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A demo was presented at the DevSummit during BSDCan2014
	in Ottawa.  Also, a meetup regarding the subject was organized
	in Krakow, Poland.</p>

      <p>The &os; Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
	dedicated to supporting and promoting the &os;&nbsp;Project
	and community worldwide. Most of the funding is used to
	support &os; development projects, conferences and developer
	summits, purchase equipment to grow and improve the &os;
	infrastructure, and provide legal support for the Project.</p>

      <p>We published our third issue of the &os; Journal. We have
	over 2700 subscriptions so far. We continued working on the
	digital edition, which will allow subscribers to read the
	magazine in different web browsers, including those than run
	on &os;. This will be available for the July/August issue of
	the Journal.</p>

      <p>We hired Anne Dickison, on a freelance basis, as our new
	marketing director, to help us promote the Foundation and
	Project.</p>

      <p>The annual board meeting was held in Ottawa, Canada, in May.
	Directors and officers were elected, and did some long term
	planning. We worked on our vision, core values, project road
	mapping, and our near term goals. We also met with the core
	team to discuss roles and responsibilities, project
	roadmapping, and what we can do to help the Project more.</p>

      <p>We were a Gold+ sponsor for BSDCan, May 16-17 and provided
	7 travel grants for developers to attend the conference. We
	also were the sponsor for both the developer and vendor
	summits.</p>

      <p>Justin Gibbs gave a &os; presentation at a &os; user's
	internal technology summit. Company visits like this help
	users understand the Project structure better and gives us
	a chance to communicate what &os; people are working on as
	well as learn what different companies are doing with &os;, as
	well as what they'd like to see supported. We can then help
	facilitate collaboration between the companies and &os;
	developers.</p>

      <p>We were represented at Great Wide Open, April 2-3
	(greatwideopen.org), Texas LinuxFest, June 13-14
	(texaslinuxfest.org), and SouthEast LinuxFest, June 20-22
	(southeastlinuxfest.org).</p>

      <p>Hardware was purchased to support an upgrade at Sentex. A new
	high capacity 1Gbps switch was deployed to allow for more
	systems to be added to the test lab.  The main file server and
	development box was upgraded to allow more users in the lab
	simultaneously.</p>

      <p>We purchased hardware, including package builders, and
	a larger server to allow NYI to be a full replica of all
	Project systems, comparable to what is in place at Yahoo Inc.
	and ISC.</p>

      <p>We worked with our lawyer to create an NDA between the
	Foundation and individuals for third party NDAs.  This allows
	developers who need access to proprietary documents, to go
	through the Foundation, via an NDA for access.</p>

      <p>&os; Foundation Systems Administrator and Release Engineer,
	Glen Barber, continued work on producing regularly-updated
	&os;/arm snapshots for embedded devices, such as the
	Raspberry Pi, ZedBoard, and BeagleBone.</p>

      <p>In addition to producing weekly development snapshots from
	the head/ and stable/ branches, with feedback and help from Ed
	Maste, Glen finished work to produce release images that will,
	by default, provide debugging files for userland and kernel
	available on the &os;&nbsp;Project FTP mirrors.  Note that the
	debugging files will not be included on the bootonly.iso,
	disc1.iso, or dvd1.iso images due to the size of the resulting
	images.</p>

      <p>Foundation staff member Konstantin Belousov completed an
	investigation into poor performance of PostgreSQL on &os;.
	This uncovered scalability problems in the &os; kernel, and
	changes to address these issues are in progress.</p>

      <p>Some previously completed Foundation-sponsored projects
	received enhancements or additional work.  The ARM
	superpages project was completed last year, but is now enabled
	by default in &os;-CURRENT.  Many stability fixes and
	enhancements have been committed to the in-kernel iSCSI stack.
	The iSCSI project was released in &os;&nbsp;10.0.  Many
	stability fixes and enhancements have been committed and will
	be included in &os;&nbsp;10.1.</p>

      <p>Work continues on the Foundation-sponsored autofs automount
	daemon, UEFI boot support, the updated vt(4) system video
	console, virtual machine images, and the Intel graphics driver
	update.  Foundation-sponsored work resulted in
	226 commits to &os; over the April to June period.</p>

    <body>
      <p>Fiasco.OC belongs to the L4 microkernel family. A microkernel
	provides a bare minimum of services to the applications
	running on top of it, unlike traditional kernels that
	incorporate complex code like IP stacks and device drivers.
	This allows a dramatic decrease in the amount of code
	running in the privileged mode of the CPU, achieving higher
	security while still providing an acceptable level of
	performance.</p>

      <p>Running an operating system kernel on top of the microkernel
	allows leveraging any software that was developed for that
	operating system. The OS kernel runs in user-mode side-by-side
	with other microkernel applications such as real-time
	components. Multiple OSes, each with their userland
	applications, can even be run in parallel, thus allowing
	construction of products where processing of corporate data is
	strictly separated from the processing of private data.</p>

      <p>The project aims to create a port of &os; to the Fiasco.OC
	microkernel, a high performance L4 microkernel
	developed by TU Dresden. Existing ports of OpenBSD and
	Linux are used as a reference. This will allow the use of

    <body>
      <p>pkg(8) is the new package management tool for &os;.  It
	is now the only supported package management tool for &os;
	releases from 10.0-RELEASE, including the upcoming
	9.3-RELEASE.  pkg(8) is available on all currently supported
	releases.  Support for the legacy pkg_tools is due to be
	discontinued at the beginning of September 2014.</p>

      <p>The release of pkg(8) 1.3 is imminent.  This includes major
	improvements in the dependency solver.  Now we can:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Switch versions of, for example, Perl or PHP and resolve all the
	  conflicts with packages that depend on them automatically.
	  No more need to manually switch package origins.</li>

	<li>Deal more gracefully with complex upgrade or install
	  scenarios.</li>

	<li>Sandbox operations dealing with freshly downloaded data
	  until it can be verified as trustworthy by checking the
	  package signature.</li>

	<li>Deal with provides-and-requires style of dependencies, so
	  for example we can say "this package needs to use a web
	  server" and allow that dependency to be fulfilled by apache
	  or nginx or any other alternative that provides web-server
	  functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Beyond the next release, we have work in progress on allowing
	ranges of versions in dependency rules and handling
	a selection of "foreign" package repositories, such as CPAN or
	CTAN or PyPi.</p>

      <p>There are plans to use pkg(8) to package up the base system.
	Along with other benefits, this will allow writing a universal
	installer: download one installer image and from
	there install any available version of &os;, including
	snapshots.</p>

      <p>We are also intending to use pkg(8) within the ports tree at
	package-build time to handle fulfilling build dependencies.
	This opens the possibility of installing build-dependencies by
	downloading binary packages, which means you can install
	a package with customized options with the minimum amount of
	time spent compiling anything else.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>We are sorely lacking a comprehensive testing setup.
	Integrating automated regression testing into the development
	cycle is becoming an imperative.</task>

      <task>We need testers who can run development versions of pkg in

      <p>The alternate pkg(8) repository, built with WITH_NEW_XORG, is

	their ports with WITH_NEW_XORG. See the announcement, linked
	above for further information.</p>

      <p>Thanks to a contribution from Jan Kokemüller, Radeon 32bit
	ioctls are now working on 64bit hosts. This was tested
	successfully with Wine and StarCraft II on &os; 9.x and 11.
	This required modifications to <tt>emulators/i386-wine-devel</tt> so
	that it works with WITH_NEW_XORG, and the creation of a new
	port, <tt>libtxc_dxtn</tt>, to support texture compression required by
	StarCraft II. We haven't yet had the time to polish
	everything, so this still requires manual steps.</p>

      <p>The DRM generic code update is ready, but it breaks the
	current i915 driver. Therefore, the i915 driver must be
	updated before anything is committed.</p>

      <p>Compared to the previous status report, OpenCL test programs are
	running fine now, thanks to upgrades and fixes to libc++ and
	Clang.  Relevant ports are still not ready to hit the ports

      <p>ZFSguru is a multifunctional server appliance with a strong
	emphasis on storage. ZFSguru began as simple web-interface
	frontend to ZFS, but has since grown into a &os; derivative
	with its own infrastructure.  The scope of the project has
	also grown with the inclusion of add-on packages that add
	functionality beyond the traditional NAS functionality found
	in similar product like FreeNAS and NAS4Free.  ZFSguru aims to
	be a true multifunctional server appliance that is extremely
	easy to setup and can unite both novice and more experienced
	users in a single user interface. The modular nature of the
	project combats the danger of bloat, whilst still allowing
	extended functionality to be easily deployed.</p>

      <p>Where development in the first quarter of this year brought
	drag-and-drop permissions for Samba and NFS, development in
	the second quarter focused on strengthening the infrastructure
	of the project. A new library and toolkit solution dubbed
	'Mesa' is in the works, providing a cleaner foundation to the
	project. A new master server providing secure remote services
	is being setup, to be located in a high-speed datacenter. But
	most importantly, a new system build infrastructure has shown
	great progress and will soon be able to provide automated
	system builds to our users. This not only improves the
	frequency of system releases but also frees much developer
	time to be spent on different areas of the project.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, a new website and forum is being worked at,
	replacing the old-fashioned website that offers only limited
	functionality. The new website will be linked to the server
	database, providing real-time updates about the project.</p>

      <p>In addition, a new platform for collaborated development is
	in the works. A service addon has been created for the GitLab
	project, which is a drop-in replacement of the popular GitHub
	website. The choice was made to host our own solution and not
	rely on GitHub itself. In retrospect this appears to be a good
	decision. The recent development where GitHub removed projects
	after DCMA-takedowns being sent is incompatible with the
	philosophy of free-flow-of-information, which the ZFSguru
	project is a strong proponent of. By hosting our own solution,
	we have avoided any dependency on third party projects.</p>

	<p>It is expected that after the infrastructure of the project
	has been revamped, work on the web-interface itself can
	continue. New functionality such as GuruDB and Service
	Bulletins provide a tighter connection between the server
	infrastructure and the web-interface.  The Migration Manager
	is one of the last remaining features still missing in the
	web-interface. This functionality provides an easy way to
	upgrade the current system by performing a new clean
	installation, but migrate all relevant configuration to the
	new installation. It also allows to 'backup' all system
	configuration in a single file to be stored on a different
	machine should things go awry.</p>

	perspective on the project, can be found <url

      <p>FreeBSD received 39 project proposals this year, many of
	which were of a very high standard.  After a difficult
	selection process narrowing these down into the slots we had
	been allocated, a total of 16 projects were selected to
	participate in Google Summer of Code 2014 with FreeBSD.</p>

	<p>Projects selected cover a wide range of areas within FreeBSD,
	covering both the base system and ports infrastructure,
	userland and kernel.  We have students working on firewall
	optimisation, ports packaging tools, embedded systems,
	debugging infrastructure, improved Unicode support, enhancements
	to the loader and to the installer, and several other areas of
	work.  We are just over half way through the allocated time this
	year, and are very much looking forward to integrating code
	produced by these projects into FreeBSD.</p>
         
      <p>This is the tenth time FreeBSD has taken part in Google's
	Summer of Code, and we are grateful to Google to have accepted
	us as a participating organisation.</p>

    <body>
      <p>A new driver, ioat(4), was added to the tree.  ioat(4)
	supports Intel's I/O Acceleration Technology devices which are found
	on some Intel server systems.</p>

      <p>These devices are DMA offload engines, which can accelerate
	some I/O-heavy applications by offloading memory copies from the main
	CPU to the I/OAT unit.  This acceleration is not transparent;
	applications must be adapted to take advantage of the hardware.</p>

      <p>Some I/OAT models support more advanced copying modes, like
	XOR; these modes are not yet supported in the ioat(4) driver.</p>

      <p>IPsec is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel
	configuration, and work is proceeding to speed things up in various
	ways.  The latest changes are the addition, by &a.jmg;, &a.eri;, and
	&a.gnn;, of AES modes both in hardware and in software.  Part of this
	work also includes more benchmarks undertaken using Conductor in the
	netperf project.  Results have been reported at BSDCan and vBSDcon
	with more to come at EuroBSDcon and BSDCon Brasil.

      <p>With the advent of DTrace we are able to replace many of
	the internal kernel debugging options, such as TCPDEBUG,
	with statically defined tracepoints (SDTs).  Tracepoints have now
	been added to the system that replicate the functionality of the
	TCPDEBUG kernel option.  No new kernel options need to be added
	&mdash; they are standard with any kernel that has DTrace, which
	is included in the default GENERIC kernels in 10.x and HEAD.

    </links>

    <body>
      <p>The Acer C720 Chromebook is an affordable (under $200) and
	powerful little laptop, that provides a battery life of up to six
	hours running FreeBSD.  It is a great machine for travelling and
	coding in general.  The machine is fully functional, meaning that
	all essential devices work: Keyboard, trackpad, light sensor,
	backlight control, display in VESA mode (fast), external Display
	on HDMI (only VESA mirror mode), sound, USB ports, SD card slot,
	camera and Atheros Wireless.</p>

      <p>This quarter, this project extended previous work on the
	boot process and keyboard driver as well as the smbus(4) driver.
	It added three new drivers: ig4(4), cyapa(4) and isl(4).</p>

      <p>Much of the development was originally done in late 2014;
	since then, the patches have been massively improved and merged
	into CURRENT, so that all relevant devices work without manual
	patching.</p>

      <p>For those who are unable to run CURRENT, there is a
	backported patch to 10.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>Thanks to everyone who helped in the process, I couldn't
	have done it without you (you know who you are).

      <p>This project aims to add support for the LiquidIO family
	of high-performance programmable accellerator 10/40-gigabit
	Ethernet network adapters.  The currently developed kernel driver
	supports CN6640- and CN6880-based PCIe cards, enabling the
	following features:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A CNNIC API for controlling/interacting with the smart NIC
	  from user and kernel space including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Handling multiple concurrent applications running on the
	      same device</li>
	    <li>Request/reply mechanism for (a)synchronous
	      ordered/unordered communication</li>
	    <li>Remote memory operations</li>
	    <li>Device shutdown/reset</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>A basic NIC module utilizing the CNNIC API and a
	  Cavium-provided NIC firmware.  This module provides:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Single/multi-queue TX</li>
	    <li>Hardware TCP/UDP checksum offloading</li>
	    <li>Large Receive Offload</li>
	    <li>Promiscous mode</li>

	<li>Sysctl-based device statistics and configuration view</li>
	<li>Custom firmware loading via user-built modules and
	  &os;'s firmware(9) mechanism.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The project is currently being developed in house and is
	currently being prepared for upstream.  We plan on making it
	available in &os; 11.</p>

	&quot;Wanted Ports&quot; list on the &os; Wiki.</p>

      <p>In the last month there was steady progress, which finally
	resulted in the PR for adding the new port.  In addition to the
	many dependencies &a.pgollucci; is working on, there was already a
	large amount of work done.  In addition to  many new or updated
	rubygems, Rails 4.1 was resurrected.  Many committers were
	involved in the process and guided us through the various problems
	and pitfalls.</p>

      <p>Because of the number of dependencies &mdash; we nearly hit
	100 &mdash; making progress takes some time.  In the meantime,
	there is already a new major version of GitLab released, which
	requires even more dependencies and updates.  Work on this version

	stable version from the 7.14 branch into the ports tree.

      <p>One of the long missing features of FreeBSD was the ability
	to boot up with a temporary rootfs, configure the kernel to
	be able to access the real rootfs, and then replace the
	temporary root with the real one.
	In Linux, the functionality is known as pivot_root.
	The reroot projects aims to provide similar functionality in
	a different, slightly more user-friendly way: rerooting.
	Simply put, from the user point of view it's as simple as
	running "reboot -r", which makes the system perform a partial
	shutdown, killing all processes and unmounting the rootfs,
	and then partial bringup, mounting the new rootfs, running
	init, and running the startup scripts as usual.</p>

      <p>The kernel part of the project was committed to 11-CURRENT.
	The userland part is at "finishing touches" stage, and is
	expected to be committed soon.
	A merge to stable/10 is planned and reroot support should
	be included in &os; 10.3.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
	dedicated to supporting and promoting the &os; Project and
	community worldwide.
	Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is
	used to fund and manage development projects, conferences and
	developer summits, and provide travel grants to &os;
	developers.  The Foundation purchases hardware to improve and
	maintain &os; infrastructure and publishes &os; white papers
	and marketing material to promote, educate, and advocate for
	the &os; Project.
	The Foundation also represents the &os; Project in executing
	contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements
	that require a recognized legal entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help &os; last
	quarter:</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison and Deb Goodkin attended OSCON to promote
	&os;.</p>

      <p>&a.rwatson; organized and ran the Cambridge &os;
	Developer Summit 2015 ("BSDCam").
	We provided travel grants to two &os; developers to attend
	the summit.
	Three Foundation board/staff members attended too.</p>

      <p>&a.gnn; attended the ARM Partner Meeting where
	he met with 15 silicon and systems vendors to present the
	unique traits and qualities of &os; and work on setting up
	partnerships with the companies building and deploying
	ARM hardware.</p>

      <p>George and &a.rwatson; collaborated in Cambridge on
	developing further &os;-based teaching material at
	undergraduate and masters levels.
	Part of this project was funded by the Foundation.</p>

      <p>George planned and ran the DevSummit at vBSDCon 2015.</p>

      <p>We were  proud to be a sponsor of
	<url href="http://www.verisign.com/en_US/internet-technology-news/verisign-events/vbsdcon/index.xhtml">vBSDCon
	2015</url>, Sept 11-13 in Washington DC.
	&a.gnn; and &a.emaste; presented "Supporting a
	BSD Project" at the conference.
	&a.dru;, &a.gjb;, &a.gnn;, and &a.emaste;
	attended and represented the Foundation at both vBSDCon and
	the &os; Developer Summit that preceded it.
	We had many people stop by our table to make a donation,
	and it was another great opportunity to talk and work with
	people face-to-face.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Blain and &a.jhb; promoted the Foundation and
	&os; at the SNIA 2015 Storage Developer Conference, in
	Santa Clara, California, Sept 21-24.
	The Foundation was also a sponsor.</p>

      <p>We sponsored Andy Turner to attend Linaro Connect in
	San Francisco, Sept 21-25.</p>

      <p>&a.emaste;, our project development director, attended the
	X.Org Developer's Conference (XDC) in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

      <p>We sponsored the 2015 nginx Conference and sent &os;
	community member &a.jhb;.</p>

      <p>George  Neville-Neil continued planning the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201511VendorDevSummit">2015
	Silicon Valley Vendor Summit</url>, including securing
	the venue.</p>

      <p>&a.bcr; and &a.erwin; helped plan and
	organize the EuroBSDCon &os; Developer Summit.
	This included setting up the working groups, securing the
	venue, and getting the T-shirts made.</p>

      <p>Benedict helped organize, and he and &a.dru; participated
	in, the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201507DevSummit">&os;
	Hackathon</url> in the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany.
	It was a successful weekend of fixing bugs and collaborating
	with others.</p>

      <p>&a.dru; taught a &os; class in Berlin, Germany
	July 29-31.</p>

      <p>We were a sponsor of
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/index.cfm">womENcourage
	2015</url>, in Uppsala Sweden, Sept 24-26.
	Dru was the moderator for a panel on
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/panel2.cfm">Open Source
	as a Career Path</url>.
	All the panelists were &os; contributors including
	Dan Langille, Allan Jude, Benedict Reuschling,
	and Deb Goodkin.
	We also had a table at the job fair and talked to a lot of
	students and professors about the benefits of working on &os;
	as an alternative to an internship, teaching about &os; in
	university classes, and hosting &os; events at their schools.
	Dan taught a workshop on How to Contribute to an Open Source
	project.
	Deb participated in this workshop and started a discussion on
	offering a similar workshop at BSD and non-BSD conferences.
	The workshop would be titled "How to Contribute to &os;",
	and participants would learn how to contribute documentation
	to the Project.</p>

      <p>We continued to publish our monthly newsletters keeping the
	community informed on what we are doing including event
	recaps, testimonials, project updates, and upcoming events.
	We received testimonials from Microsoft, NYCBus, and
	ScaleEngine.
	We also continued to approach companies to provide us with
	testimonials to help promote their use of &os;.</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison rebooted the Faces of &os; series and is
	working with &os; contributors on writing their stories.
	She continued to produce more &os; Swag and literature to
	promote &os;, as well as advocating for &os; over our social
	channels and with new partnerships.</p>

      <p>We reached our 2015 goal of 10,000 &os; Journal subscribers,
	and we published a new Open Journal article on our website,
	to help promote the Journal.
	We also started offering a new subscription bundle, where you
	can buy all the 2014 issues.
	The July/August issue what published.</p>

      <p>&a.gibbs; began a semester long &os; class at a middle
	school in Boulder, Colorado.
	We are using the BeagleBone Black (BBB) to run &os; connected
	to Macs and PCs.
	We’ve received a lot of support, both internally, and from
	the Project, to get the &os; images to work on the BBB with
	the Macs and PCs.
	It’s been a great collaborative effort with community
	members, and this will help future classes in being able
	to support inexpensive platforms for teaching &os;.</p>

      <p>Work continued on creating &os; curriculum for a half day
	workshop.
	Hopefully this will be available in late Spring.</p>

      <p>We provided legal support for the Project including granting
	trademark permission for some users and companies who
	requested permission to put the &os; logo on their websites
	and marketing literature.</p>

      <p>We met with commercial users to get their input on what
	they’d like to see supported in &os;.
	We also do this to help connect &os; developers with
	commercial users to help facilitate collaboration.</p>

      <p>&os; Foundation employee and Release Engineer, &a.gjb;,
	was extremely busy during this quarter, working on a number
	of exciting areas of the &os; Project.
	Some of the highlights include:
	<ul>
	  <li>Code cleanup and bug fixes to several parts of the
	    release build code, and finished adding support for
	    automatically uploading cloud provider images, which was
	    merged to the stable/10 branch before the code freeze.
	    The 10.2-RELEASE cycle spanned a 9-week timeframe overall,
	    from the start of the code slush.</li>
	  <li> With the &os; Release Engineering Team, released two
	    BETA builds and three RC builds for the 10.2-RELEASE
	    cycle, with the final release announced mid-August,
	    two weeks ahead of the original schedule.</li>
	  <li>With the &os; Cluster Administrators Team, assisted with
	    a number of general updates and enhancements to the &os;
	    infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>

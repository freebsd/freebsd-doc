    <body>
      <p>A new driver, ioat(4), was added to the tree.  ioat(4)
	supports Intel's I/O Acceleration Technology devices which are found
	on some Intel server systems.</p>

      <p>These devices are DMA offload engines, which can accelerate
	some I/O-heavy applications by offloading memory copies from the main
	CPU to the I/OAT unit.  This acceleration is not transparent;
	applications must be adapted to take advantage of the hardware.</p>

      <p>Some I/OAT models support more advanced copying modes, like
	XOR; these modes are not yet supported in the ioat(4) driver.</p>

      <p>IPsec is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel
	configuration, and work is proceeding to speed things up in various

	&a.gnn;, of AES modes both in hardware and in software.  Part of this
	work also includes more benchmarks undertaken using Conductor in the
	netperf project.  Results have been reported at BSDCan and vBSDcon
	with more to come at EuroBSDcon and BSDCon Brasil.

      <p>With the advent of DTrace we are able to replace many of
	the internal kernel debugging options, such as TCPDEBUG,
	with statically defined tracepoints (SDTs).  Tracepoints have now
	been added to the system that replicate the functionality of the
	TCPDEBUG kernel option.  No new kernel options need to be added
	&mdash; they are standard with any kernel that has DTrace, which
	is included in the default GENERIC kernels in 10.x and HEAD.

    </links>

    <body>
      <p>The Acer C720 Chromebook is an affordable (under $200) and
	powerful little laptop, that provides a battery life of up to six
	hours running FreeBSD.  It is a great machine for travelling and
	coding in general.  The machine is fully functional, meaning that
	all essential devices work: Keyboard, trackpad, light sensor,
	backlight control, display in VESA mode (fast), external Display
	on HDMI (only VESA mirror mode), sound, USB ports, SD card slot,
	camera and Atheros Wireless.</p>

      <p>This quarter, this project extended previous work on the
	boot process and keyboard driver as well as the smbus(4) driver.
	It added three new drivers: ig4(4), cyapa(4) and isl(4).</p>

      <p>Much of the development was originally done in late 2014;
	since then, the patches have been massively improved and merged
	into CURRENT, so that all relevant devices work without manual
	patching.</p>

      <p>For those who are unable to run CURRENT, there is a
	backported patch to 10.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>Thanks to everyone who helped in the process, I couldn't
	have done it without you (you know who you are).

      <p>This project aims to add support for the LiquidIO family
	of high-performance programmable accellerator 10/40-gigabit
	Ethernet network adapters.  The currently developed kernel driver
	supports CN6640- and CN6880-based PCIe cards, enabling the
	following features:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A CNNIC API for controlling/interacting with the smart NIC
	  from user and kernel space including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Handling multiple concurrent applications running on the
	      same device</li>
	    <li>Request/reply mechanism for (a)synchronous
	      ordered/unordered communication</li>
	    <li>Remote memory operations</li>
	    <li>Device shutdown/reset</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>A basic NIC module utilizing the CNNIC API and a
	  Cavium-provided NIC firmware.  This module provides:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Single/multi-queue TX</li>
	    <li>Hardware TCP/UDP checksum offloading</li>
	    <li>Large Receive Offload</li>

	<li>Sysctl-based device statistics and configuration view</li>
	<li>Custom firmware loading via user-built modules and
	  &os;'s firmware(9) mechanism.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The project is currently being developed in house and is
	currently being prepared for upstream.  We plan on making it
	available in &os; 11.</p>

	&quot;Wanted Ports&quot; list on the &os; Wiki.</p>

      <p>In the last month there was steady progress, which finally
	resulted in the PR for adding the new port.  In addition to the
	many dependencies &a.pgollucci; is working on, there was already a
	large amount of work done.  In addition to  many new or updated
	rubygems, Rails 4.1 was resurrected.  Many committers were
	involved in the process and guided us through the various problems
	and pitfalls.</p>

      <p>Because of the number of dependencies &mdash; we nearly hit
	100 &mdash; making progress takes some time.  In the meantime,
	there is already a new major version of GitLab released, which
	requires even more dependencies and updates.  Work on this version

      <p>One of the long missing features of FreeBSD was the ability
	to boot up with a temporary rootfs, configure the kernel to
	be able to access the real rootfs, and then replace the
	temporary root with the real one.
	In Linux, the functionality is known as pivot_root.
	The reroot projects aims to provide similar functionality in
	a different, slightly more user-friendly way: rerooting.
	Simply put, from the user point of view it's as simple as
	running "reboot -r", which makes the system perform a partial
	shutdown, killing all processes and unmounting the rootfs,
	and then partial bringup, mounting the new rootfs, running
	init, and running the startup scripts as usual.</p>

      <p>The kernel part of the project was committed to 11-CURRENT.
	The userland part is at "finishing touches" stage, and is
	expected to be committed soon.
	A merge to stable/10 is planned and reroot support should
	be included in &os; 10.3.</p>

    <body>

      <p>We have updated clang, llvm, lldb, compiler-rt and libc++
	in base to 3.7.0 release.
	These all contain numerous improvements; please see the linked
	release notes for more detailed information.
	This brings us completely up-to-date with the latest upstream
	versions of these projects.  Meanwhile, &a.emaste; is working
	on importing the llvm.org version of libunwind.</p>

      <p>Like the 3.5.x and 3.6.x releases, these components require
	C++11 support to build.  At this point, FreeBSD 10.0 and later
	provide that support, at least on x86.
	Currently, there are no solid plans to MFC these versions to
	any stable branches, due to the difficulties this would
	introduce for the usual upgrade scenarios.</p>

      <p>Thanks to &a.emaste; and &a.andrew; for their help with this
	import, and thanks to &a.antoine; for several ports exp-runs.
      </p>

      <p>During the first ports exp-run, some major problems were
	found, one introduced by a clang bug which caused pow() to
	generate floating point exceptions in some cases, which in
	turn caused libpng to fail to build, and one bug in
	libjpeg-turbo, which was caused by undefined behavior.
	These two problems took some time to fix, after which another
	exp-run was done, and this resulted in about a dozen newly
	failed ports.  For almost all of these new failures, fixes
	were submitted, and linked to the original PR 201377 for
	the exp-run.</p>

      <p>The Mesa ports were updated to 10.6.8. At the same time, the
	ports received a major overhaul to make sure all ports are
	correctly configured.
	Also the dual version support was removed; there is only one
	mesa version for all supported &os; versions.
	The libosmesa port was merged into the Mesa framework.</p>

      <p>Another big item that was included in the Mesa port is
	OpenCL.  There are two GPU-based OpenCL implementations:
	lang/clover for supported Radeon cards, and
	lang/beignet for supported Intel cards (currently only
	Ivybridge).
	Thanks go to Johannes Dieterich, O. Hartmann, and Koop Mast
	for making this happen.</p>

      <p>Now that Mesa is up-to-date, we can apply the same update
	procedure to the X.Org server.  It is currently at 1.14,
	and an update to 1.17 is ready.
	It should be committed shortly.</p>

      <p>On the kernel side, progress has been made with the
	i915 update.  The driver is able to attach.
	There are some reports that the X.Org server starts, but Mesa
	is unhappy so acceleration does not work yet.
	If you want to test, instructions will be posted on the wiki,
	in the i915 update article (see links).
	At this stage, we can only accept patches, though &mdash; we won't be
	able to provide support.</p>

      <p>We attended two conferences: XDC 2015 in Toronto and
	EuroBSDcon 2015 in Stockholm.
	Reports will be posted on the blog.

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
	dedicated to supporting and promoting the &os; Project and
	community worldwide.
	Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is
	used to fund and manage development projects, conferences and
	developer summits, and provide travel grants to &os;
	developers.  The Foundation purchases hardware to improve and
	maintain &os; infrastructure and publishes &os; white papers
	and marketing material to promote, educate, and advocate for
	the &os; Project.
	The Foundation also represents the &os; Project in executing
	contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements
	that require a recognized legal entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help &os; last
	quarter:</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison and Deb Goodkin attended OSCON to promote
	&os;.</p>

      <p>&a.rwatson; organized and ran the Cambridge &os;
	Developer Summit 2015 ("BSDCam").
	We provided travel grants to two &os; developers to attend
	the summit.
	Three Foundation board/staff members attended too.</p>

      <p>&a.gnn; attended the ARM Partner Meeting where
	he met with 15 silicon and systems vendors to present the
	unique traits and qualities of &os; and work on setting up
	partnerships with the companies building and deploying
	ARM hardware.</p>

      <p>George and &a.rwatson; collaborated in Cambridge on
	developing further &os;-based teaching material at
	undergraduate and masters levels.
	Part of this project was funded by the Foundation.</p>

      <p>George planned and ran the DevSummit at vBSDCon 2015.</p>

      <p>We were  proud to be a sponsor of
	<url href="http://www.verisign.com/en_US/internet-technology-news/verisign-events/vbsdcon/index.xhtml">vBSDCon
	2015</url>, Sept 11-13 in Washington DC.
	&a.gnn; and &a.emaste; presented "Supporting a
	BSD Project" at the conference.
	&a.dru;, &a.gjb;, &a.gnn;, and &a.emaste;
	attended and represented the Foundation at both vBSDCon and
	the &os; Developer Summit that preceded it.
	We had many people stop by our table to make a donation,
	and it was another great opportunity to talk and work with
	people face-to-face.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Blain and &a.jhb; promoted the Foundation and
	&os; at the SNIA 2015 Storage Developer Conference, in
	Santa Clara, California, Sept 21-24.
	The Foundation was also a sponsor.</p>

      <p>We sponsored Andy Turner to attend Linaro Connect in
	San Francisco, Sept 21-25.</p>

      <p>&a.emaste;, our project development director, attended the
	X.Org Developer's Conference (XDC) in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

      <p>We sponsored the 2015 nginx Conference and sent &os;
	community member &a.jhb;.</p>

      <p>George  Neville-Neil continued planning the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201511VendorDevSummit">2015
	Silicon Valley Vendor Summit</url>, including securing
	the venue.</p>

      <p>&a.bcr; and &a.erwin; helped plan and
	organize the EuroBSDCon &os; Developer Summit.
	This included setting up the working groups, securing the
	venue, and getting the T-shirts made.</p>

      <p>Benedict helped organize, and he and &a.dru; participated
	in, the
	<url href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/201507DevSummit">&os;
	Hackathon</url> in the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany.
	It was a successful weekend of fixing bugs and collaborating
	with others.</p>

      <p>&a.dru; taught a &os; class in Berlin, Germany
	July 29-31.</p>

      <p>We were a sponsor of
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/index.cfm">womENcourage
	2015</url>, in Uppsala Sweden, Sept 24-26.
	Dru was the moderator for a panel on
	<url href="http://womencourage.acm.org/panel2.cfm">Open Source
	as a Career Path</url>.
	All the panelists were &os; contributors including
	Dan Langille, Allan Jude, Benedict Reuschling,
	and Deb Goodkin.
	We also had a table at the job fair and talked to a lot of
	students and professors about the benefits of working on &os;
	as an alternative to an internship, teaching about &os; in
	university classes, and hosting &os; events at their schools.
	Dan taught a workshop on How to Contribute to an Open Source
	project.
	Deb participated in this workshop and started a discussion on
	offering a similar workshop at BSD and non-BSD conferences.
	The workshop would be titled "How to Contribute to &os;",
	and participants would learn how to contribute documentation
	to the Project.</p>

      <p>We continued to publish our monthly newsletters keeping the
	community informed on what we are doing including event
	recaps, testimonials, project updates, and upcoming events.
	We received testimonials from Microsoft, NYCBus, and
	ScaleEngine.
	We also continued to approach companies to provide us with
	testimonials to help promote their use of &os;.</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison rebooted the Faces of &os; series and is
	working with &os; contributors on writing their stories.
	She continued to produce more &os; Swag and literature to
	promote &os;, as well as advocating for &os; over our social
	channels and with new partnerships.</p>

      <p>We reached our 2015 goal of 10,000 &os; Journal subscribers,
	and we published a new Open Journal article on our website,
	to help promote the Journal.
	We also started offering a new subscription bundle, where you
	can buy all the 2014 issues.
	The July/August issue what published.</p>

      <p>&a.gibbs; began a semester long &os; class at a middle
	school in Boulder, Colorado.
	We are using the BeagleBone Black (BBB) to run &os; connected
	to Macs and PCs.
	We’ve received a lot of support, both internally, and from
	the Project, to get the &os; images to work on the BBB with
	the Macs and PCs.
	It’s been a great collaborative effort with community
	members, and this will help future classes in being able
	to support inexpensive platforms for teaching &os;.</p>

      <p>Work continued on creating &os; curriculum for a half day
	workshop.
	Hopefully this will be available in late Spring.</p>

      <p>We provided legal support for the Project including granting
	trademark permission for some users and companies who
	requested permission to put the &os; logo on their websites
	and marketing literature.</p>

      <p>We met with commercial users to get their input on what
	they’d like to see supported in &os;.
	We also do this to help connect &os; developers with
	commercial users to help facilitate collaboration.</p>

      <p>&os; Foundation employee and Release Engineer, &a.gjb;,
	was extremely busy during this quarter, working on a number
	of exciting areas of the &os; Project.
	Some of the highlights include:
	<ul>
	  <li>Code cleanup and bug fixes to several parts of the
	    release build code, and finished adding support for
	    automatically uploading cloud provider images, which was
	    merged to the stable/10 branch before the code freeze.
	    The 10.2-RELEASE cycle spanned a 9-week timeframe overall,
	    from the start of the code slush.</li>
	  <li> With the &os; Release Engineering Team, released two
	    BETA builds and three RC builds for the 10.2-RELEASE
	    cycle, with the final release announced mid-August,
	    two weeks ahead of the original schedule.</li>
	  <li>With the &os; Cluster Administrators Team, assisted with
	    a number of general updates and enhancements to the &os;
	    infrastructure.</li>

      <p>The aim of this project is to design and implement
	infrastructure to validate that a number of the network stack's

      <p>At present, most parts of this project have been
	implemented.  It mainly consists of two parts:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>A general mechanism to collect the per-ring per-cpu
	  statistics that can be used by all NIC drivers, and extensions to
	  netstat(1) to report these statistics.</li>

	<li>A suite of network stack behavior testing programs that consists
	  of:
	  <ul>
	    <li>a virtual multiqueue ethernet interface (vme)</li>
	    <li>a UDP packet generator based on vme</li>

      <p>Atomic operations serve two fundamental purposes.  First, they
	are the building blocks for expressing synchronization algorithms
	in a single, machine-independent way using high-level languages.
	In essense, atomics abstract the different building blocks
	supported by the various architectures on which &os; runs,
	making it easier to develop and reason about lock-less code by
	hiding hardware-level details.</p>

      <p>Atomics also provide the barrier operations that allow software
	to control the effects on memory of out-of-order and speculative
	execution in modern processors as well as optimizations by
	compilers.  This capability is especially important to
	multithreaded software, such as the &os; kernel, when running
	on systems where multiple processors communicate through a shared
	main memory.</p>

      <p>Each machine architecture defines a memory model, which
	specifies the possible effects on memory of out-of-order and
	speculative execution.  More precisely, it specifies the extent to
	which the machine may visibly reorder memory accesses in order to
	optimize performance.  Unfortunately, there are almost as many
	models as architectures.  Moreover, some architectures, for
	instance IA32 or Sparcv9 TSO, are relatively strongly ordered.  In
	contrast, others, like PowerPC or ARM, are very relaxed.  In
	effect, atomics define a very relaxed abstract memory model for
	&os;'s machine-independent code that can be efficiently
	realized on any of these architectures.</p>

      <p>However, most &os; development and testing still happens on
      x86 machines, which, when combined with x86's strongly ordered
      memory model, leads to errors in the use of atomics, specifically,
      barriers.  In other words, the code is not properly written to
      &os;'s abstract memory model, but the strong ordering of the
      x86 architecture hides this fact.  The architectures impacted
      by the code that incorrectly uses atomics are less popular or
      have limited availability, and the resulting bugs from the misuse
      of atomics are hard to diagnose.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to audit and upgrade the usage of
	lockless facilities, hopefully fixing bugs before they are
	observed in the wild.</p>

      <p>&os; defines its own set of atomics operations, like many
	other operating systems.  But unlike other operating systems, &os;
	models its atomics and barriers on the release consistency model,
	which is also known as acquire/release model.  This is the same
	model which is used by the C11 and C++11 language standards as
	well as the new 64-bit ARM architecture.  Despite having
	syntactical differences, C11 and &os; atomics share essentially
	the same semantics.  Consequently, ample tutorials about the C11
	memory model and algorithms expressed with C11 atomics can be
	trivially reused under &os;.</p>

      <p>One facility of C11 that was missing from &os; atomics,
	was fences.  Fences are bidirectional barrier operations
	which could not be expressed by the existing atomic+barrier
	accesses.  They were added in r285283.</p>

      <p>Due to the strong memory model implemented by x86 processors,
	atomic_load_acq() and atomic_store_rel() can be implemented by
	plain load and store instructions with only a compiler barrier; no
	additional ordering constraints are required.  This simplification
	of atomic_store_rel() was done some time ago in r236456.  The
	atomic_load_acq() change was done in r285934, after careful review
	of all its uses in the kernel and user-space to ensure that no
	hidden dependency on a stronger implementation was left.</p>

      <p>The only reordering in memory accesses which is allowed on
	x86 is that loads may be reordered with older stores to different
	locations.  This results from the use of store buffers at the
	micro-architecural level.  So, to ensure sequentially consistent
	behavior on x86, a store/load barrier needs to be issued, which
	can be done with an MFENCE instruction or by any locked RMW
	operation.  The latter approach is recommended by the optimization
	guides from Intel and AMD.  It was noted that careful selection of
	the scratch memory location, which is modified by the locked RWM
	operation, can reduce the cost of barrier by avoiding false data
	dependencies.  The corresponding optimization was committed in
	r284901.</p>

      <p>The atomic(9) man page was often a cause of confusion due to
	both erroneous and ambiguous statements.  The most significant of
	these issues were addressed in changes r286513 and r286784.</p>

      <p>Some examples of our preemptive fixes to the misuse of atomics
	that would only become evident on weakly ordered machines
	are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A very important lockless algorithm, used in both the
	  kernel and libc, is the timekeeping functionality implemented in
	  <tt>kern/kern_tc.c</tt> and the userspace
	  <tt>__vdso_gettimeofday</tt>.  This algorithm relied on x86 TSO
	  behavior.  It was fixed in r284178 and r285286.</li>

	<li>The <tt>kern/kern_intr.c</tt> lockless updates to the
	  <tt>it_need</tt> indicator were corrected in r285607.</li>

	<li>An issue with
	  <tt>kern/subr_smp.c:smp_rendezvous_cpus()</tt> not guaranteeing

      <p>RISC-V is an open source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
	designed at UC Berkeley.  It is freely available for all uses
	without requiring fees or license agreements.
	The RISC-V team intends to provide freely available
	BSD licensed CPU designs.</p>

      <p>&a.br; (University of Cambridge) now has &os; booting
	to a single user shell on a RISC-V simulator.
	The porting effort started only two months ago
	and is very much a work in progress, requiring significant
	refactoring and clean up before it reaches a committable
	state.  Nonetheless this is exceptional progress in a short
	time.  The porting effort also identified a number of
	proposed ISA improvements.</p>

      <p>The port currently uses the GNU tool chain (GCC and
	binutils), and runs on the Spike simulator.  Improved RISC-V
	support in Clang/LLVM and related tools is highly desired.</p>

      <p>The Ports Collection typically receives less attention on
	Tier-2 architectures than on Tier-1 architectures, although
	several build-runs were performed at various points in the past,
	and broken ports were marked as such at those times.</p>

      <p>Some of the Tier-2 platforms, such as PowerPC and ARM,
	have improved considerably recently, both on &os;'s and the
	compilers' sides, but as the tree is not rebuilt on the cluster
	very often, it was suspected that many ports are marked BROKEN
	while they in fact now build and run correctly.</p>

      <p>Over the past several weeks, 26 ports that were indeed
	broken on at least PowerPC had been fixed, 58 ports that were
	incorrectly marked as broken (left-overs from the old times) were

      <p>The biggest task handled by the Core Team during this quarter
	was developing and publishing the new Code of Conduct.  The Code
	of Conduct describes how people are expected to behave on all &os;
	official communication channels, as well as how developers and other
	people involved with the project are to behave when representing the
	project in public.</p>

      <p>The Code of Conduct was generally well received and elicited
	numerous comments and suggestions for improvements from the
	community, many of which have been integrated.</p>

      <p>The next task handled by Core was the restoration of Babak
	Farrokhi's ports commit bit.  Babak is an Iranian resident and
	consequently had run afoul of US trade sanctions, which the
	project had initially been advised would make it illegal
	for him to contribute.  After several years, Core was asked to
	revisit the issue.  On the advice of counsel, Core decided that
	it could restore commit privileges to commmitters resident in
	Iran.</p>

      <p>The CTM service came under security review.  Given that the lack of
	use of routine authenticity checking made the injection of
	trivial exploit code relatively easy, the service was held to be
	too risky to continue as an official part of the &os; base system.
	CTM has very few remaining users but they should be able to
	install CTM from the Ports Collection in order to continue doing
	so.</p>

      <p>Core learned that ISC was ceasing its hosting service, which has
	entailed a rapid rework of plans on the movement of significant
	portions of the &os; cluster to that datacentre.  Cluster
	administration has taken ownership of the situation and is making
	progress.</p>

      <p>Core fielded an enquiry about NextBSD and whether this
	should be the future direction for the whole &os; project.  Core's
	position is that NextBSD is an interesting project, and we regard
	it, like the other BSD projects, as a potential source of good
	ideas.  However, we currently have no plans to adopt NextBSD as
	the official &os; distribution.</p>

      <p>Beyond these issues, Core also spent time in various routine
	activities.  During this quarter we issued three new
	src commit bits, and took none in for safekeeping.  Welcome to
	&a.allanjude;, &a.araujo;, and &a.avos;.

      <p>As of the end of Q3 the ports tree holds a bit more
	than 25,000 ports, and the PR count is above 2,000.
	The summer period saw less activity on the ports tree
	than during the previous quarter, with fewer than 7,000
	commits performed by 120 active committers.
	Unfortunately, the number of problem reports closed
	also decreased significantly, with fewer than 1,500
	problem reports fixed during Q3.</p>

      <p>In Q3 several commit bits were taken in for safekeeping,
	following an inactivity period of more than 18 months (fluffy), or
	on committer's request (xmj, stefan, brix).  One new developer was
	granted a ports commit bit (&a.junovitch.email;), and one returning
	committer (&a.farrokhi;) had his commit bit reinstated.</p>

      <p>On the management side, no changes were made to the
	portmgr team during Q3.</p>

      <p>On the QA side, 25 exp-runs were performed to validate
	sensitive updates or cleanups.  Amongst those, the noticeable
	changes are the update to <tt>pkg</tt> 1.6, the <tt>automake14</tt>
	removal, and several important ports updates such as
	<tt>doxygen</tt> to 1.8.10, <tt>gnome3</tt> to 3.16,
	<tt>cmake</tt> to 3.3.1, and the Qt4 ports to 4.8.7.  The default
	jdk was also set to <tt>openjdk8</tt>.  Some infrastructure
	changes included the addition of new options helpers:
	<tt>opt_VARS</tt>, <tt>opt_VARS_OFF</tt>, <tt>opt_IMPLIES</tt>,

    <body>
      <p>The &os; Cluster Administration Team consists of the people
	responsible for administering the machines that the project
	relies on for its distributed work and communications to be
	synchronised.</p>

      <p>Our primary cluster has been hosted as a guest in California
	for many years.  Our ongoing project is relocating the core
	functionality to a location in New Jersey with a formal
	hosting arrangement.  This is an equipment refresh,
	consolidation for better use of resources, and for better
	continuity of service.</p>

      <p>There is a significant amount of behind-the-scenes work to
	make this happen.  The original cluster was implemented with
	a common, shared, assumed-to-be secure network with
	ubiquitous NFS everywhere.  This structure does not lend
	itself well to being distributed across geographically
	diverse locations, particularly when Internet transit is
	required.  The bulk of the work is rebuilding services to be
	portable, stand-alone components that do not depend on
	shared-network access and are safe enough to use across the
	insecure Internet.</p>

      <p>Highlights this quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Many internal distribution systems switched from rsync to
	  a distribution mesh using &quot;syncthing&quot;.</li>
	<li>We have implemented more code/data signing infrastructure
	  with out-of-band verification.</li>
	<li>New 32-core reference build hosts are online.</li>
	<li>Internal admbugs switched from bugzilla 4.4 to 5.0 and
	  packages were made available for the bugmeister team.</li>
	<li>Finally switched from varnish3 to varnish4.</li>
	<li>We exorcised hub.FreeBSD.org, the last survivor of the
	  2012 security incident.</li>
	<li>vuxml and the legacy portaudit build system were converted to
	  components and integrated.</li>
	<li>https://download.FreeBSD.org/ is nearing completion (please
	  do not use until officially announced).</li>
	<li>A Taiwan node was brought into service for pkg, ftp,
	  svn, and vuxml mirroring.</li>
	<li>One of the freebsd-update mirrors was converted from
	  lighttpd to nginx due to a data corruption bug.</li>
	<li>Completed detachment of the svn repository from the old
	  cluster and moved it to its new location.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ongoing:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The cluster runs a mixture of 11-current and 10-stable
	  as part of our &quot;eat our own dogfood&quot; project.  For this
	  to be useful we do monthly cluster refreshes to keep up with
	  current code.</li>
	<li>We build internal base system snapshots every few days
	  and packages every day.</li>
	<li>We also provide support for non-clusteradm-operated
	  services including jenkins, reviews, portsnap,
	  freebsd-update, bugzilla, package builders, git, and mercurial.
	  This varies from as little as maintaining SSL front-ends
	  through operating servers, distributing data or building
	  packages/binaries to run.</li>

      <p>On arm64, numerous cleanups and fixes have been applied to
	the kernel.  This includes fixes to exception handling,
	asynchronous signals, ddb, and pmap.  ddb has been updated to
	better handle accessing memory that may be unmapped.  The pmap
	code was made more complete by implementng more functions as
	needed.</p>

      <p>Further work on SMP means that &os; now boots on all 48
	cores on the Cavium ThunderX platform.  This includes adding
	support for the ARM GICv3 interrupt controllers and fixing the
	memory mapping to be shareable between CPUs.</p>

      <p>The test suite has been run on both qemu, and hardware.  Most of the
	test cases are passing, with around 30 tests either broken or failing.
	Work on diagnosing the issues with the remaining test cases is ongoing.

      <p>The &os; documentation translation process has been in need
	of modernization for quite some time.  The existing process
	was just too difficult for translators to keep translations up
	to date.</p>

      <p>With help from Benedict Reuschling, Shaun McCance, Ryan
	Lortie, Hiroki Sato, and many others, the availability of a
	new PO translation system was announced in August.</p>

      <p>PO translations handle most of the overhead of the
	translation process.  Translators do not have to keep track of
	commits to the upstream English version.  The actual work of
	translating is quicker and easier.  PO editors show how much
	of the document has been translated.  If a translation is
	already available for a given string, it can be easily
	reused.</p>

      <p>Early testing has been very successful.  Most issues involve
	discovering and documenting the new processes rather than
	fixing bugs.  New translations of English documents have
	already been committed.</p>

      <p>There will certainly be additional changes and improvements,
	but the system works.  We will continue to discover how to
	share work between translation teams and the project as a
	whole.  This work will be much easier now that the initial
	hurdle of being able to use PO software has been passed.

	to non-trivial bikeshedding.</p>

      <p>The CSS shrunk the reader's font from the size they had
	requested.  It specified hardcoded font and object sizes in
	pixels.  On wide monitors, only the middle third of the screen
	was used.  Hardware has changed from what existed when
	this version of the site was created.  Screens have become larger
	and wider, and increased in resolution at the same time.</p>

      <p>It was time for a change.  Font sizes were set to
	percentages, with none smaller than 100%.  The width of the
	main box was changed to 90%.  Other small adjustments were
	added.  These limited changes produced a rendered site that
	better respects the reader's settings, is much easier to read,
	and shows more information.</p>

      <p>Although no content changed, the appearance was so different
	that some viewers thought we had redesigned the site.  It is
	gratifying to know that so many people are using it.  We would
	also like to thank people for the response, which was
	overwhelmingly positive and hardly bikesheddy at all.</p>

      <p>Xen is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing
	services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute
	on the same computer hardware concurrently.  Xen support for &os;
	on x86 as a guest was introduced in version 8 and ARM support is
	currently being worked on.  Support for running &os; as an amd64
	Xen host (Dom0) is available in HEAD.</p>

      <p>On the x86 front most of the Xen work during this quarter
	was focused on reworking the implementation of PVH inside of the
	Xen hypervisor, so most of the activity during this quarter
	happened inside of the hypervisor.  Patches for a clean PVH
	implementation have been posted, with the aim of having them
	merged in the next Xen release (4.7).  Once that's done, work will
	continue on adding new features to both &os; and Xen in order to
	have feature parity with traditional PV guests/hosts.</p>

      <p>Apart from this, work is ongoing to import a new netfront
	from Linux in order to support new features, like split event
	channel and multiple queue support.</p>

      <p>On the ARM front, this quarter's work focused on getting
	&os;/arm64 booting as Xen guest.  The current activity is to
	upstream patches preparing Xen drivers to support arm64; this
	includes a rework of the console driver.</p>

    <title>High Availability clustering in CTL</title>

    <body>
      <p>CAM Target Layer (CTL), when originally developed by
	Copan/SGI, had support for High Availability clustering.
	Unfortunately, significant portions of the HA code were never
	published with the main body of the source code.  Now, the missing
	part has been reimplemented from scratch and fixed/improved.</p>

      <p>This code supports dual-node HA with Asynchronous LUN Unit
	Access (ALUA) in four modes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Active/Unavailable without interlink between nodes, where
	  the secondary node can report nothing except its presence.</li>
	<li>Active/Standby with secondary node handling only basic LUN
	  discovery and reservation, synchronizing state and command
	  execution with the primary node through the interlink.</li>
	<li>Active/Active with both nodes processing commands and
	  accessing the backing storage, synchronizing state and command
	  execution with the primary node through the interlink.</li>
	<li>Active/Active with secondary node having no backing storage
	  access, but instead working as a proxy, transfering all commands
	  to the first node for execution through the interlink.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the case of lost interlink connectivity to primary node,
	the secondary node falls into the Transitioning state, which is
	like Unavailable and can't answer most requests, but makes the
	initiator wait for recovery or cluster failover.</p>

      <p>CTL also got a large number of other improvements, including
	support for emulation of CD/DVD drives and removable disks,
	live LUN reconfiguration, etc.</p>

      <p>The code is committed to &os; head and was recently merged to
	stable/10 branch.

      <p><tt>mandoc</tt> is a suite of tools for compiling
	<tt>mdoc</tt>, the <tt>roff</tt> macro language of choice for BSD
	manual pages.</p>

      <p><tt>mandoc</tt> is the default renderer for manpages on
	&os; head.  This quarter, the apropos(1) utility was switched to
	use mandoc's version, which offers a new database format (in
	sqlite) bringing more powerful, fine-grained ways to search
	manpages.</p>

      <p>While mandoc is very good for manpages, we also provide
	lots of other documentation in plain <tt>roff</tt> format.  The
	heirloom toolchain is being studied to replace <tt>groff</tt> in
	base.  The heirloom nroff toolchain has multiple benefits: it has
	very good unicode support, and  very good compatibility with
	groff.</p>

      <p>A great deal of work as been done testing the heirloom
	nroff toolchain with all the roff documents in the base system
	(including manpages), and upstream has been very proactive in
	fixing reported bugs.</p>

      <p>The 'soelim(1)' utility has been replaced with a
	BSD-licensed version which is good enough to work with all available
	roff toolchains (to ease transition).  This version
	of the soelim(1) utility, originally written solely for &os;, is
	now part of the mandoc tool suite.</p>

      <p>The col(1) utility has been cleaned up and updated to
	recognize both SUSv2-style escape-digit and BSD-style
	escape-control-char sequences in the input stream (in coordination
	with Ingo Schwarze from OpenBSD)</p>

      <p>The checknr(1) utility has been cleaned up and extended to
	support modern roff(7) macros (including synchronizing code from NetBSD
	and the heirloom docutils version).</p>

      <p>Many roff fixes were made to documentation and manpages,
	having been discovered while testing the new toolchain.

	porting effort.</p>


      <p>Additional Semihalf-sponsored work on ThunderX support
	brought brand new features such as:</p>

      <ul>
	<li> Multi-socket operation:
	  &os; now runs on a two-node ThunderX server board with total
	  number of 96 CPU cores!</li>
	<li>Virtual Networking Interface Card driver:
	  The VNIC driver consists of 4 elements (BGX, MDIO, and
	  Physical and Virtual Functions) and is the second driver in &os;
	  to utilize SR-IOV capabilities.  ThunderX is now able to use
	  built-in networking interfaces at 1&ndash;40 Gbps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Moreover, previously introduced functionalities have been
	improved and committed to HEAD.  This include:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>PCIe drivers (for both internal and external
	  controllers)</li>
	<li>ITS (Interrupt Translation Services) fixes</li>
	<li>Platform-specific changes for ThunderX</li>
	<li>Various other fixes to kernel (PCI, UMA, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The remaining features are being reviewed and will be
	integrated to HEAD soon.  However, the GENERIC kernel already
	supports and runs on ThunderX.

      <p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an extension to TCP that allows
	for the use of multiple network interfaces on a standard TCP
	session.  The addition of new addresses and scheduling of data
	across these occurs transparently from the perspective of the TCP
	application.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to deliver an MPTCP kernel
	patch that interoperates with the reference MPTCP implementation,
	along with additional enhancements to aid network research.</p>

      <p>The v0.5 patch was released, which is the first patch
	of the re-written implementation.  We are in the process of
	documenting the new design and addressing some feedback as
	provided from the community.</p>

      <p>Work has commenced on improved input handling, as the current
	method of receiving and reassembling segments has been the cause
	of some instability/stalls during connection shutdown.  This will
	involve re-using the subflow receive buffers and an upcall to
	enqueue a MP-layer reassembly task without the need to take a lock
	on the MP control block.  The improvements should also allow
	bypassing <tt>mptcp_usrreq</tt> for standard TCP connections.</p>

      <p>The MPTCP commit history was synchronized with
	hg-beta.FreeBSD.org, and have made the repository available on
	BitBucket (see links).  Future patch releases will be tagged
	there.  The tree is now merged with &os; head weekly.  An updated
	v0.51 patch is ready for release.

      <p>CloudABI is a POSIX-like runtime environment that uses Capsicum
	as its sole access control mechanism.  CloudABI allows you to
	develop software that is better hardened against security
	vulnerabilities, is easier to test, and is easier to migrate
	across systems.</p>

      <p>As of August, all of the kernel modifications that are needed to
	run CloudABI programs have been integrated into &os; head.  Once
	you load the <tt>cloudabi64</tt> kernel module, you can
	either run CloudABI programs directly from the shell or by
	using the <tt>cloudabi-run</tt> tool
	(<tt>sysutils/cloudabi-utils</tt>).  The latter allows you to
	inject sockets, files, and directories into the launched
	program in a more structured way.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, work has started on developing a Ports Collection
	that contains cross-compiled utilities and libraries for CloudABI.
	The intent is that this framework generates native packages for a
	number of operating systems, making it possible to develop
	CloudABI applications on any operating system, regardless of
	whether that operating system actually supports CloudABI.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in CloudABI, be sure to go to the project
	page on GitHub, watch recordings of talks at conferences or wait
	for the upcoming edition of the FreeBSD Journal, which will
	feature an article on CloudABI.</p>

    <body>
      <p>The nosh project is a suite of system-level utilities for
	initializing, running, and shutting down BSD systems, and for
	managing daemons, terminals, and logging.  It supersedes BSD
	<tt>init</tt> and the NetBSD <tt>rc.d</tt> system, drawing
	inspiration from Solaris SMF for named milestones,
	daemontools-encore for service control/status mechanisms, UCSPI,
	and IBM AIX for separated service and system management.  It
	comprises a range of compatibility mechanisms, including shims for
	familiar commands from other systems, and an automatic import
	mechanism that takes existing configuration data from
	<tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, <tt>/etc/rc.conf{,.local}</tt>,
	<tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, and elsewhere, applying them to its native
	service definitions and creating additional native services.  It
	is portable (including to Linux) and composable, it provides a
	migration path from the world of systemd Linux, it does not
	require new kernel APIs.  It provides clean service environments,
	orderings and dependencies between services, parallelized startup
	and shutdown (including fsck), strictly size-capped and
	autorotated logging, the service manager as a
	&quot;subreaper&quot;, and uses kevent(2) for event-driven
	parallelism.</p>

      <p>The past few months have seen a growth in the import
	mechanism, with full import of <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and
	<tt>/etc/ttys</tt> available in version 1.18 in July, and importing
	PC-BSD Warden and &os;&nbsp;9 jails, and full import of <tt>gbde</tt> and
	<tt>geli</tt> mount/unmount mechanisms in version 1.21 in October.
	It has also gained the ability to automatically re-generate
	<tt>host.conf</tt> and <tt>sysctl.conf</tt> whenever their source
	files change.</p>

      <p>Other developments in the past few months include fully
	independent shutdown support, no longer relying upon an externally
	provided shutdown command from another toolset, and a full suite of
	binary packages.  As of version 1.20, it became possible to
	have a fully-nosh-managed system, on both &os; and Linux, using just
	precompiled binary packages.</p>

      <p>The biggest task remaining is one that was set a while ago:
	the creation of enough native service bundles and ancillary
	utilities to entirely supplant the <tt>rc.d</tt> system.  A
	lot of this has been achieved, with the original target list of
	157 items now down to just 39 remaining.  These are the tricky
	ones, of course, where help is most needed.

      <p>PCI Express (PCIe) hot-plug is used on both laptops and

	ExpressCard has built-in USB support that is already supported by

      <p>There are various advantages to using jumbo frames,

      <p>The script currently does not restore the system to its

      <p>The &os; bootloader has used Ficl 3 for quite some time, so
	this project was intended to update the version of Ficl in use
	to Ficl 4.  Ficl 4 is not only faster but also has a smaller
	memory footprint, both being important advantages for a
	bootloader.</p>

      <p>As part of the Google Summer of Code program, I worked on
	importing the Ficl 4 sources to get a bootloader running Ficl 4.
	The first half of the summer consisted of setting up my test
	environment, as well as arranging the sources in the tree properly
	and modifying the build files to point to the new locations.  Once
	that was complete, the sources had to be modified to build
	correctly and to add back in some of the &os;-specific parts from
	Ficl 3.  Unfortunately, after all those tasks were completed, a
	few bugs in the Ficl project were discovered that delayed the
	bootloader update, so it is not finished.  The Illumos project has
	faced similar issues with Ficl 4 so I received some good tips from
	them, but since school has started back up I haven't been able to
	put much work into fixing the bugs.

      <p>Currently, the library is functionally complete, ready to
	be downloaded and receive everyone's attention.  We've also
	decided to bundle the <tt>mtree</tt> program along with it.  The
	bundled <tt>mtree</tt> has also been modified for better
	portability</p>

      <p>The project also included modifying <tt>libarchive</tt>,
	<tt>install</tt> and <tt>makefs</tt> to use libmtree.  These
	modified versions are also available.</p>

      <p>Please see the Wiki page for more information, download
	locations and an example of using the libmtree API.

      <p>ZFSguru started as front-end to ZFS but has since grown
	into a multifunctional server appliance with its own unique
	features. While the project is still in early development, it
	already offers multiple unique features not found in other
	projects. Unlike similar projects, nothing is stripped away from
	the base operating system, meaning ZFSguru behaves as a normal
	FreeBSD installation and thus is very versatile. The web-interface
	is designed to unite both novice and advanced users, providing
	both very easy to use basic functionality as well as features to
	be appreciated by more experienced users. The modular nature of
	the project combats the danger of bloat, whilst still allowing
	extended functionality to be easily deployed.</p>

      <p>On the 15th of August, version 0.3 of ZFSguru was released. Some
	highlights of the new version:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>New build infrastructure allows for frequent releases of
	  system images and services in a semi-automated way.</li>
	<li>A new GuruDB database allows for a growing number of system
	  images and servers, and provide good caching to accelerate
	  pages.</li>
	<li>The installation procedure was given a major
	  overhaul.</li>
	<li>In addition to the LiveCD, USB images are now available.
	  The USB image supports both legacy MBR bootcode and UEFI boot
	  support.</li>
	<li>Many libraries in the web-interface have been
	  overhauled, in addition to many other additions to the
	  web interface.</li>
	<li>Many improvements were made to optional add-on services,
	  such as the new Gnome 3 graphical environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other progress made in the months July, August and
	September:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>System image builds 001, 002, 003 and 004 have been
	  released for all supported branches: 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
	  (-STABLE) and 11.0 (-CURRENT).</li>
	<li>Work on the 0.4 web-interface has started, which focuses
	  on improving network support in the web-interface.</li>
	<li>Work on a new visual theme for the web-interface has
	  started.  The new interface is likely to be included in the upcoming
	  0.4 release.</li>
	<li>A new master server is being prepared, which is likely to be
	  operational in December.</li>
	<li>A new website is being worked on, to be launched the 1st
	  of January, 2016.</li>
      </ul>

	<p>The new Gnome&nbsp;3 desktop does not work for everyone
	  and still has issues. Anyone capable of diagnosing these issues
	  can give the Gnome&nbsp;3 LiveCD a try. Please see the linked

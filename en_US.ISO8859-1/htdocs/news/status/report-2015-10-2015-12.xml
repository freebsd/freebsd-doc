    <body>
      <p>LKL (&quot;Linux Kernel as a Library&quot;) is a special
	&quot;architecture&quot; of the full Linux kernel that builds as a
	userspace library on various platforms, including &os;.  One
	application of such a library is using Linux's filesystem drivers
	to implement a FUSE backend.</p>

      <p>fusefs-lkl's <tt>lklfuse</tt> binary is such a FUSE
	filesystem.  It can mount <tt>ext4/3/2</tt>, <tt>XFS</tt>, and
	<tt>BTRFS</tt> read-write, using the native drivers from
	Linux.</p>

      <p>The <tt>sysutils/fusefs-lkl</tt> port may now be installed from
	packages or ports, providing access to these filesystems on
	&os; via FUSE.</p>

      <p> This quarter, support was added for fixed-width sysctls
	(signed and unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers).
	The new KPIs are documented in the <tt>sysctl(9)</tt> manual page.
	The <tt>sysctl(8)</tt> command line tool supports all of the new
	types.</p>

      <p><tt>sysctl(8)</tt> gained the '-t' flag, which prints sysctl type
	information (the original patch was submitted by Yoshihiro Ota).
	This support includes the newly added fixed-width types.</p>

      <p> I/OAT DMA engines are bulk memory operation offload
	engines built into some Intel Server/Storage platform
	CPUs.</p>

      <p>This quarter, several enhancements were made to the driver.
	The driver now avoids memory allocation in locked paths, which
	should avoid deadlocking in memory pressure scenarios.  Support
	for Broadwell-EP devices has been added.  The
	&quot;blockfill&quot; operation and a non-contiguous 8 KB copy
	operation have been added to the API.  The driver can recover from
	various programming errors by resetting the hardware.</p>

      <p>The Mellanox &os; team is proud to announce support for the
	ConnectX-4 series of network cards in &os; 11-current and &os;
	10-stable.  These devices deliver top performance, with up to
	100GBit/s of raw transfer capacity, and support both Ethernet and
	Infiniband.  Currently, the Ethernet driver is ready for use and
	the Infiniband support for ConnectX-4 is making good progress.  We
	hope that it will be complete before &os; 11.0 is released.  For
	more technical information, refer to the <tt>mlx5en(4)</tt> manual
	page in 11-current.  The new driver for ConnectX-4 cards is called
	<tt>mlx5</tt> and is put under <tt>/sys/dev</tt> and not under
	<tt>/sys/ofed</tt> as was done for the previous
	<tt>mlx4</tt> driver.  The <tt>mlx5en(4)</tt> kernel module is
	compiled by default in GENERIC kernels.</p>

      <p>There are two working proof-of-concept drivers for the

      <p>Proper touchscreen support would consist of a userland event
	reading API, a kernel event reporting API, and kernel hardware
	drivers for specific devices.  There is an ongoing effort to port
	the Linux evdev API to &os; so applications that use libraries like
	libinput or tslib could be used without any major changes.  Since
	it is not yet complete, I created a naive evdev-like API for both
	kernel and tslib and was able to run a demo on a Beaglebone Black
	with 4DCAPE-43T.</p>

      <p>Once evdev makes it into the tree, both hardware drivers
	can be modified to include &quot;report events&quot;

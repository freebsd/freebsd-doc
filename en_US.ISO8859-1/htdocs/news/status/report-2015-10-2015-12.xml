    <body>
      <p>LKL (&quot;Linux Kernel as a Library&quot;) is a special
	&quot;architecture&quot; of the full Linux kernel that builds as a
	userspace library on various platforms, including &os;.  One
	application of such a library is using Linux's filesystem drivers
	to implement a FUSE backend.</p>

      <p>fusefs-lkl's <tt>lklfuse</tt> binary is such a FUSE
	filesystem.  It can mount <tt>ext4/3/2</tt>, <tt>XFS</tt>, and
	<tt>BTRFS</tt> read-write, using the native drivers from
	Linux.</p>

      <p>The <tt>sysutils/fusefs-lkl</tt> port may now be installed from
	packages or ports, providing access to these filesystems on
	&os; via FUSE.</p>

      <p> This quarter, support was added for fixed-width sysctls
	(signed and unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers).
	The new KPIs are documented in the <tt>sysctl(9)</tt> manual page.

      <p><tt>sysctl(8)</tt> gained the '-t' flag, which prints sysctl type

	This support includes the newly added fixed-width types.</p>

      <p>This quarter, several enhancements were made to the driver.
	The driver now avoids memory allocation in locked paths, which

      <p>The Mellanox &os; team is proud to announce support for the
	ConnectX-4 series of network cards in &os; 11-current and &os;
	10-stable.  These devices deliver top performance, with up to
	100GBit/s of raw transfer capacity, and support both Ethernet and
	Infiniband.  Currently, the Ethernet driver is ready for use and
	the Infiniband support for ConnectX-4 is making good progress.  We
	hope that it will be complete before &os; 11.0 is released.  For
	more technical information, refer to the <tt>mlx5en(4)</tt> manual
	page in 11-current.  The new driver for ConnectX-4 cards is called
	<tt>mlx5</tt> and is put under <tt>/sys/dev</tt> and not under

	<tt>mlx4</tt> driver.  The <tt>mlx5en(4)</tt> kernel module is

      <p>This completed project includes changes to better manage
	the vnode freelist and to streamline the allocation and freeing of
	vnodes.</p>

      <p>Vnode cache recycling was reworked to meet free and unused
	vnodes targets.  Free vnodes are rarely completely free; rather,
	they are just ones that are cheap to recycle.  Usually they are
	for files which have been stat'd but not read; these usually have
	inode and namecache data attached to them.  The free vnode target
	is the preferred minimum size of a sub-cache consisting mostly of
	such files.  The system balances the size of this sub-cache with
	its complement to try to prevent either from thrashing while the
	other is relatively inactive.  The targets express a preference
	for the best balance.</p>

      <p>&quot;Above&quot; this target there are 2 further targets
	(watermarks) related to the recyling of free vnodes.  In the
	best-operating case, the cache is exactly full, the free list has
	size between vlowat and vhiwat above the free target, and
	recycling from the free list and normal use maintains this state.
	Sometimes the free list is below vlowat or even empty, but this
	state is even better for immediate use, provided the cache is not
	full.  Otherwise, vnlru_proc() runs to reclaim enough vnodes
	(usually non-free ones) to reach one of these states.  The
	watermarks are currently hard-coded as 4% and 9% of the available
	space.  These, and the default of 25% for wantfreevnodes, are too
	large if the memory size is large.  E.g., 9% of 75% of MAXVNODES
	is more than 566000 vnodes to reclaim whenever vnlru_proc()
	becomes active.</p>

      <p>The <tt>vfs.vlru_alloc_cache_src</tt> sysctl is removed.
	New code frees namecache sources as the last chance to satisfy the
	highest watermark, instead of selecting source vnodes randomly.
	This provides good enough behaviour to keep vn_fullpath() working
	in most situations.  Filesystem layouts with deep trees, where the
	removed knob was required, is thus handled automatically.</p>

      <p>As the kernel allocates and frees vnodes, it fully
	initializes them on every allocation and fully releases them on
	every free.  These are not trivial costs: it starts by zeroing a
	large structure, then initializes a mutex, a lock manager lock, an
	rw lock, four lists, and six pointers.  Looking at
	<tt>vfs.vnodes_created</tt>, these operations are being done
	millions of times an hour on a busy machine.</p>

      <p>As a performance optimization, this code update uses the
	uma_init and uma_fini routines to do these initializations and
	cleanups only as the vnodes enter and leave the vnode zone.  With
	this change, the initializations are done <tt>kern.maxvnodes</tt>
	times at system startup, and then only rarely again.  The frees
	are done only if the vnode zone shrinks, which never happens in
	practice.  For those curious about the avoided work, look at the
	vnode_init() and vnode_fini() functions in sys/kern/vfs_subr.c to
	see the code that has been removed from the main vnode
	allocation/free path.</p>

      <p>The QLogic HBA driver <tt>isp(4)</tt> received a
	substantial set of changes.  Their primary goal was to make Fibre
	Channel target role work well with CTL, but many other things were
	also fixed/improved:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Added support for modern 16Gbps 26xx FC cards.</li>

	<li>The firmware in <tt>ispfw(4)</tt> were updated to the
	  latest versions.</li>

	<li>Target role support was fixed and tested for all FC cards from
	  ancient 1Gbps 22xx to modern 16Gbps 26xx.</li>

	<li>Port database handling was unified for target and initiator
	  roles, allowing HBA port to play both roles at the same time.</li>

	<li>The maximal number of ports was increased from 256 to
	  1024.</li>

	<li>Multi-ID (NPIV) functionality was fixed/implemented, allowing
	  24xx and above cards to provide up to 255 virtual FC ports per
	  physical port.</li>

	<li>Added support for 8-byte LUNs for 24xx and above cards.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The code is committed to &os; head and stable/10 branches.</p>

      <p>The Raspberry Pi SoC consists of two parts: ARM and GPU
	(VideoCore).  Many interesting features like OpenGL, video
	playback, and HDMI controls are implemented on the VideoCore side
	and can be accessed from the OS through libraries provided by
	Broadcom (userland repo).  These libraries were ported to &os;
	some time ago, so Mika&euml;l created the port
	<tt>misc/raspberrypi-userland</tt> for them.  He also created a
	port for <tt>omxplayer</tt> (a low-level video player that
	utilizes VideoCore APIs) and is working on a port for Kodi
	(ex-XBMC), a more user-firendly media player software with
	Raspberry Pi support.</p>

      <p><a href="http://lxqt.org/">LXQt</a> is the Qt port of and
	the upcoming version of LXDE, the Lightweight Desktop Environment.
	It is the product of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the
	Razor-qt projects.</p>

      <p>The porting effort remains heavily a work in progress: it
	needs some components of Plasma 5 (the new major KDE's
	workspace).</p>

      <p>Currently, only the 0.10 branch is functional.  See our
	wiki page for a complete list of applications.</p>

      <p>We also sent updates for some components of LXDE (required
	for the LXQt desktop):</p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>x11/menu-cache</tt> 1.0.1</li>

	<li><tt>x11/lxmenu-data</tt> 0.1.4</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Binary packages are available (only for test purposes)
	which are regularly tested with the KDE development
	repository.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    
    <p>This installment of the Bi-Monthly Status Report is a few days late,
      but I'm pleased to say that it is chocked full of over 30 articles.
      May and June were yet again busy months; the Netperf project passed
      major milestones and can now be run with the debug.mpsafenet tunable
      turned on from sources in CVS.  The ARM, MIPS, and PPC ports saw quite
      a bit of progress, as did several other SMPng and Netgraph projects.
      FreeBSD 5.3 is just around the corner, so don't hesitate to grab a
      snapshot and test the progress!</p>

    <p>On a more serious note, it's very important to remember that code
      freeze for FreeBSD 5.3 will happen on August 15, 2004.  This is only
      a few weeks away and there is still a lot to do.  The TODO list for
      the release can be found at
      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.3R/todo.html">
      http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.3R/todo.html</a>.  If
      you are looking for a way to contribute to the release, this TODO list
      has several items that are in urgent and in need of attention.
      Testing is also very important.  The tree has had some stability
      stability problems in the past few weeks, but there are work-arounds
      that should allow everyone to continue testing and using FreeBSD.  We
      absolutely must have FreeBSD 5.3 be a rock-solid release, so every
      little bit of contributed effort helps!</p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>

      <p>This project is aimed at converting the FreeBSD network stack from
        running under the single Giant kernel lock to permitting it to
        run in a fully parallel manner on multiple CPUs (i.e., a fully
        threaded network stack).  This will improve performance/latency
        through reentrancy and preemption on single-processor machines, and
        also on multi-processor machines by permitting real parallelism in
        the processing of network traffic. As of FreeBSD 5.2, it was
        possible to run low level network functions, as well as the IP
        filtering and forwarding plane, without the Giant lock, as well as
        "process to completion" in the interrupt handler.  This permitted
        both inbound and outbound traffic to run in parallel across
        multiple interfaces and CPUs.</p>
      
      <p>Work continues to improve the maturity and completeness of the
        locking (and performance) of the network stack for 5.3. The network
        stack development branch has been updated to the latest CVS HEAD,
        as well as the following and more.  Many but not all of these
        changes have been merged to the FreeBSD CVS tree as of the writing
        of this report.  Complete details and more minor changes are
        documented in the README file on the netperf web page.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Addition of hard-coded WITNESS lock orders for socket-related
          locks, route locks, interface locks, file descriptor locks,
          SLIP, and PCB locks for various protocols (UDP, TCP, UNIX
          domain sockets).  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Modified MAC Framework to use inpcbs as the source for mbuf
          labels rather than reaching up to the socket layer, avoiding the
          additional acquisition of socket locks.  Locked access to
          so_label and so_peerlabel using the socket lock throughout;
          assert socket lock in the MAC Framework where depended on.  MAC
          Framework now makes a copy of the socket label before
          externalizing to prevent a copyout while holding the label lock
          (and potentially seeing an inconsistent label). (Merged)</li>
        <li>Extensive annotation of locking state throughout the network
          stack, especially relating to sockets.</li>
        <li>Several locking fixes for ng_base.c, the basic Netgraph
          infrastructure. (Merged)</li>
        <li>Global accept filter list locking, especially during registration.
          (Partially merged)</li>
        <li>Revise locking in socket state transition helpers, such as
          soisconnecting(), soisconnected(), etc, to simplify lock
          handling. (Merged)</li>
        <li>Fix bugs in netatalk DDP locking, merge all netatalk locking to
          CVS. (Merged)</li>
        <li>soref() socket locking assertions and associated fixes.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>Fifofs now uses its own mutex instead of the vnode interlock to
          synchronize fifo operations, avoiding lock order issues with
          socket buffer locking. (Merged)</li>
        <li>Cleanup of locking related to file descriptor close and Giant
          requirements.  Experimentation with reducing locking here.</li>
        <li>Review and fix several instances of socket locking in the TCP
          code.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>NFS server locking merged to FreeBSD CVS.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Accept locking merged to rwatson_netperf, and to FreeBSD CVS.
          A new global mutex, accept_mtx, now protects all socket related
          accept queue and state fields (SS_COMP, SS_INCOMP), and flags
          relating to accept are moved from the generic so_state field to
          so_qstate.  accept1() rearranged, as with sonewconn() as a result,
          and a file descriptor leak fixed.  Close a variety of races in
          socket referencing during accept.  soabort() and other partially
          connected socket related functions updated to take locking into
          account.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Issue associated with non-atomic setting of SS_NBIO in fifofs
          resolved by adding MSG_NBIO.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Several flags from so_state moved to sb_state so they can be
          locked properly using the socket buffer mutex.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Socket locks are now not held over calls into the protocol
          preventing many lock order issues between socket and protocol
          locks, and avoiding a substantial amount of conditional locking.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>mbuma, the UMA-based mbuf allocator, is merged to CVS.  This
          reduces the kernel to one widely used memory allocator, improves
          performance, and allows memory from mbufs to be reclaimed and
          reused for other types of storage when pressure lowers.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>sb_flags now properly locked.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Global MAC label ifnet lock introduced to protect labels on
          network interfaces.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Rewrites of parts of soreceive() and sosend() to improve
          MP safety merged to CVS, including modifications to make sure
          socket buffer cache state is consistent when locks are released.
          sockbuf_pushsync() added to guarantee consistency of cached
          pointers.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>UNIX domain socket locking revised to use a subsystem lock due
          to inconsistencies in lock order and inconsistent coverage ofunpcb
          fields.  Cleanup of global variable locking in UNIX domain
          sockets, Giant handling when entering VFS.  All UNIX domain socket
          locking merged to CVS.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>netisr dispatch introduced in the routing code such that routing
          socket message delivery is performed asynchronously from routing
          events to avoid lock order issues.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>IGMP and multicast locking merged to CVS.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Cleanup of lasting recursive Giant acquisition left over from
          forwarding/bridging plane only locking.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>ALTQ imported into the FreeBSD in a locked state.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Conditional locking in sbdrop(), sbdroprecord(), sbrelease(),
          sbflush(), spappend(), sbappendstream(), sbappendrecord(),
          sbinsertoob(), sbappendaddr(), sbappendcontrol() eliminated.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>Some cleanup of IP stack management ioctls and lock order issues.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>Cleanup and annotation of sorflush() use of a temporary stack held
          socket buffer during flush.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Substantial cleanup of socket wakeup mechanisms to drop locks in
          advance of wakeup, avoid holding locks over upcalls, and
          assertions of proper lock state.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>With the integration of revised ifnet cloning, cloning data
          structures are now better locked.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Socket locking for portalfs.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Global so_global_mtx introduced to protect generation numbers and
          socket counts.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>KAME IPSEC and FAST_IPSEC now use rawcb_mtx to protect raw socket
          list integration.  More work required here.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Socket locking around SO_SNDLOWAT and SO_RCVLOWAT.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>soreserve() and sbreserve() reformulation to improve locking and
          consistency.  Similar cleanup in the use of reservation
          functions in tcp_mss().  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Locking cost reduction in sbappend*().  (Merged)</li>
        <li>Global locking for a number of Netgraph modules, including
          ng_iface, ng_ppp, ng_socket, ng_pppoe, ng_frame_relay, ng_tty,
          ng_eiface.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>IPv6 inpcb locking.  Resulting cleanup of inpcb locking
          assertions, and enabling of inpcb locking assertions by default
          even with IPv6 compiled in.</li>
        <li>if_xl now MPSAFE.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>soreceive() non-inline OOB support placed in its own function.
          (Merged)</li>
        <li>NFS client socket locking.  (Merged)</li>
        <li>SLIP now uses a asynchronous task queue to prevent Giant-free
          entrance of the TTY code.</li>
        <li>E-mail sent to current@ providing Giant-free operation guidelines

      <p>In the past two months, opportunities to perform a good chunk of
        work on FreeBSD/MIPS have arisen and significant issues with
        context switching, clocks, interrupts, and kernel virtual memory
        have been resolved.  A number of issues with caches were fixed,
        however those are far from complete and at last check, there
        were issues when running cached which would prevent booting
        sometimes.
        Due to toolchain issues in progress, current kernels are no
        longer bootable on real hardware.</p>
      <p>A 64-bit MIPS emulator has arisen giving the ability to test and
        debug in an emulator, and much testing has taken place in it. 
        It has been added to the FreeBSD ports tree, and the port will be
        actively tracking the main codebase as possible.  In general,
        FreeBSD/MIPS kernels should run fine in it.</p>
      <p>Before toolchain and cache issues, the first kernel threads would
        run, busses and some devices would attach, and the system would
        boot to a mountroot prompt.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD profile.sh is an enhancement to the FreeBSD 5 rcng boot
        system, targeted at laptops. One can configure multiple network
        environments (eg, home, work, university). After this initial
        configuration, the laptop detects automatically in what environment
        it is started and configures itself accordingly. Not only network
        settings, but almost everything from under /etc can be configured
        per environment.  It is also possible to suspend the machine in one
        environment and wake it up in a different one, and reconfiguration
        will happen automatically.</p>

      <p>Currently I work on two directions: if_spppfr.c and sppp locking
        (on behalf of netperf). At the moment of writing this sppp locking
        is not ready yet. But it would be ready in couple of days. Also you
        may find as a part of this work some user space fixes for rwatson
        netperf code (Only that I was able to catch while world compilation.
        If you know some others let me know and I'll try to fix them
        too).</p>
      
      <p>Since sppp code is quite big and state machine is very complicated,
        it would be difficult to test all code paths. I will glad to get
        any help in testing all this stuff. More tester more probability to
        test all possible cases.</p>
      
      <p>Work on FRF.12 (ng_frf12) is frozen since of low interest and
        lack of time. Current state of stable code: support of FRF.12
        End-to-End fragmentation. Support of FRF.12 Interface (UNI and NNI)
        fragmentation is not tested.</p>

      <p>cp(4) driver for Cronyx Tau-PCI was added. Cronyx Tau-PCI is family

        (HEAD and RELENG_4).</p>
      <p>Busdma conversion was recently finished. Current work is

      <p>An enhanced network interface cloning API has been committed.  It

      <p>Not a lot happened on the SMPng front outside of the work on
        locking the network stack (which is a large amount of work).
        The priorities of the various software interrupt threads were
        corrected and locking for taskqueues was improved.  The return
        value of the sema_timedwait() function was adjusted to be more
        consistent with cv_timedwait().  A small fix was made to the
        sleepqueue code to shorten the amount of time that a
        sleepqueue chain lock is held when waking up threads.  Some
        simple debug code for profiling the hash tables used in the
        sleep queue and turnstile code was added.  This will allow
        developers to measure the impact of any tweaks to the hash
        table sizes or the hash algorithm.</p>

        mini-driver for the ELCR register used to control the
        configuration for ISA and EISA interrupts.  The atpic driver
        reprograms the ELCR as necessary, while the apic driver
        reprograms the interrupt pin associated with an interrupt
        source as necessary.  The information about which
        configuration to use mostly comes from ACPI.  However,
        non-ACPI systems also force any ISA interrupts used to route
        PCI interrupts to use active-low polarity and level
        trigger.</p>
      
      <p>Support for suspend and resume on i386 was also slightly
        improved.  Suspend and resume support was added to the ELCR,
        $PIR, and apic drivers.</p>
      
      <p>The ACPI PCI-PCI bridge driver was fixed to fall back to the
        PCI-PCI bridge swizzle method for routing interrupts when a
        routing table was not provided by the BIOS.</p>
      
      <p>Mixed mode can now be disabled or enabled at boot time via a
        loader tunable.</p>

        of these security vulnerabilities along with internal
        security holes.  When installed, the portaudit utility
        periodically downloads a database with known issues and
        checks all installed ports or packages against it; should
        it find vulnerable software installed the administrator
        or user is notified during the daily run output of the

      <p>These utilities are considered to be of production
        quality and discussion is taking place over whether or not
        they should be included as part of the base system.  All

      <p>We imported pf as of OpenBSD 3.5 stable on June, 17th which will be
        the base for 5-STABLE pf (according to the current schedule).  The
        most important improvement in this release is the new interface
        handling which makes it possible to write pf rule sets for
        hot-pluggable devices and pseudo cloning devices, before they exist.
        The import of the ALTQ framework enabled us to finally provide the
        related pf functions as well.</p>
      
      <p>Before 5-STABLE we will import some bug fixes from OpenBSD-current,
        which have not been merged to their stable branch, as well as some
        FreeBSD specific features. The planned ALTQ API make-over will also
        affect pf.</p>
      
      <p>We are (desperately) looking for non-manpage documentation for
        FreeBSD pf and somebody to write it. Few things have changed
        so a port of the excellent "PF FAQ" on the OpenBSD homepage should
        be fitting. There are, however, a couple of points that need
        conversion.  A simple tutorial how to setup a NAT gateway with pf
        would also help.  The in-kernel NAT engine is very easy to use, we
        should tell people about this alternative. This is even more true
        since the pf module now plugs into GENERIC without modifications.</p>

      <p>The ALTQ framework is part of KAME for more than 4 years and has
        been adopted by Net- and OpenBSD since more than 3 years. It
        provides means of managing outgoing packets to do QoS and bandwidth
        limitations.  OpenBSD developed a different way to interact with
        ALTQ using pf, which was adopted by KAME as the "default for
        everyday use".</p>
      
      <p>The Romanian FreeBSD Users Group has had a project to work towards
        integration of ALTQ into FreeBSD, which provided a very good
        starting point for the final import. The import only provides the
        "pf mode" configuration and classification API as the older ALTQ3
        API does not suit to our SMP approach.</p>
      
      <p>A reworked configuration API (decoupled from pf) is in the making
        as are additional driver modifications. Both should be done before
        5-STABLE is branched, although additional drivers can be imported
        during the lifetime of 5-STABLE as well.</p>

      <p>The system continues to function well.  The accuracy of the
        automatic classification algorithm has been improved by
        assigning a higher priority to port names found in pieces of
        Makefiles.</p>
      <p>Several bugs had to be fixed due to the transition from bento to
        pointyhat.  For about two weeks the URLs to the build errors
        were wrong.  This has now been corrected (but note that some of the
        pointyhat summary pages themselves still show the broken
        links.)</p>
      <p>A report was added to show only PRs in the 'feedback' state, so
        that committers can focus on maintainer and/or responsible timeouts.
        (As a reminder, the policy is 2 weeks).  Another report on 'ports
        that are in ports/MOVED, but still exist' has also been added to the
        Anomalies page.  Sometimes these are actual errors but not always.</p>
      <p>Here are my latest observations about the trends in ports PRs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We were (very briefly) down to 650 ports PRs.  From looking
          at the graphs, this appears to be the lowest number since 2001.
          This is despite the fact that between the two time periods the
          number of ports had increased 70%.</li>
        <li>We have made a little bit of progress on the number of PRs
          which apply to existing ports and have been assigned to a FreeBSD
          committer, from 400 to around 350.  This is partly due to some
          committers going through the database, putting old PRs into the
          'feedback' state, and then later invoking the 'maintainer timeout'
          rule mentioned above.  (In some cases the PRs are now too old to
          still apply, and those are just closed.)</li>
        <li>A few maintainers are currently responsible for one-third of
          those 350.  Please, if you feel that you are over committed,
          consider asking for new volunteers to maintain these ports.</li>
        <li>In terms of build errors, there is some new breakage from
          the preliminary testing with gcc3.4, which is even stricter with
          respect to the code it will accept than was gcc3.3.  Many of these
          errors are shown as 'unknown' by the classification script.  I
          have submitted a patch to fix this.</li>
        <li>The majority of the build errors are still due to compilation
          problems, primarily from the gcc upgrades.  Since FreeBSD tends to
          be at the forefront of gcc adaptation, this is to be expected, but
          IMHO we should really try to fix as many of these as possible
          before 5.3 is released.</li>
        <li>The next highest number of build errors are caused by code
          that does not build on our 64-bit architectures due to the
          assumption that "all the world's a PC".

      <p>Many more text-processing utilities in the FreeBSD base system have
        been updated to work with multibyte characters, including comm, cut,
        expand, fold, join, paste, unexpand, and uniq. New versions of GNU
        grep and GNU sort (from coreutils) have been imported, together with
        multibyte support patches from developers at IBM and Red Hat.</p>
      <p>Future work will focus on modifying the regular expression
        functions to work with multibyte characters, improving performance
        of the C library routines, and updating the remaining utilities (sed
        and tr are two important ones still remaining).</p>

      Not much to report, Xscale support is in progress, and should
      boot at least single user really soon on an Intel IQ31244
      <p>Evaluation board.</p>

      <p>Not much coding has taken place on this lately, with the recent
        focus being on refining the design.  We are currently investigating
        per-CPU completion queues and threads in order to reduce locks and
        increase concurrency.  Also reviewing the BSD/OS CAM lockdown to see
        what ideas can be shared.  Work should hopefully puck back up in late
        July.  Development is taking place in the FreeBSD Perforce repository
        under the <tt>//depot/projects/scottl-camlock/...</tt> branch for now.</p>

      <p>Project Mini-Evil is an attempt to extend Bill Paul's 'Project Evil'
        Windows NDIS wrapper layer to the SCSI MiniPort and StorePort layers.
        While drivers exist for most storage controllers that are on the
        market today, many companies are integrating software RAID into their
        products but not providing any source code or design specs.  Instead
        of constantly reverse-engineering these raid layers and attempting to
        shoehorn them into the ata-raid driver, Project Mini-Evil will run
        the Windows drivers directly.  It will hopefully also run most any
        SCSI/ATA/RAID drivers that conform to the SCSI Miniport or Storeport
        specification.</p>
      <p>Work on this project is split between making the NDIS wrapper code
        more general and implementing the new APIs.  Development is taking
        place in the FreeBSD Perforce repository under the
        //depot/projects/sonofevil/... branch.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Happy New Year. This Report covers the last quarter of a exciting
    year 2006 for FreeBSD development. FreeBSD 6.2 is finally out of the
    door and work towards FreeBSD 7.0 is gearing up. Some of the projects
    in this report will be part of that effort, others are already in the
    tree. Many projects need your help with testing and otherwise. Please
    see the "Open tasks" sections for more information.</p>

    <p>The BSD crowd will meet at
    <a href="http://www.asiabsdcon.org/">AsiaBSDCon</a>
    March 8-10th in Tokyo and a two day FreeBSD developer summit will be
    held at
    <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a>

    May 16-19th in Ottawa. Finally,
    <a href="http://2007.eurobsdcon.org/">EuroBSDCon</a>

    September 14-15th in Copenhagen is already looking for papers.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you
    enjoy reading.</p>

      <p>FreeSBIE is approaching the 2.0-RELEASE. The first release
      candidate proved to be good enough but a second one will probably
      be released. An external developer is working on integrating
      BSDInstaller in FreeSBIE 2.0 and this may cause a little delay of
      the release date. Release Notes were written and need to be updated
      with the current list of packages. A script which allows to switch
      Tor+Privoxy on and off was added and its usage was documented. The
      2.0-RELEASE is near, hopefully near the end of January but this
      will also depend on when FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE will be released.</p>

      <p>Basic audio capture is working. All of the parameters are set by
      userland, while the RISC program generation is by kernel. No real
      audio has been captured as there are no drivers for the NTSC tuner
      yet. Someone with a real Bt878 NTSC card that is supported by
      bktr(4) could use this to capture audio without using the sound
      card.</p>

      <p>Due to lack of documentation from DViCO and LG, I have copied
      magic values from the Linux driver and managed to get ATSC
      capturing working. There was a bug in the capture driver that was
      releasing buffers to userland early causing what appeared to be
      reception issues. Now that we use the RISC status bits as buffer
      completion bits, capture works cleanly. This does mean that even if
      you provide more than 4 buffers to the driver, the buffers will be
      divided into four segments, and returned in segments.</p>

      <p>A Python module is available, along with a sample capture
      application using it. The module is now known to work well with
      threads so that tuning (expensive due to i2c ioctls) can happen in
      another thread without causing program slow down. The module is
      working well with a custom PVR backend.</p>

      <p>Additional ioctls have been added to get sibling devices. This
      allows one to open a bktrau device, and get the correct bktr(4)
      device that is in the same slot. This is necessary so that when
      adjusting GPIO pins or sending i2c commands, they are to the
      correct device.</p>

      it was decided to make it a monthly event focused on both src,
      ports and doc. Audience decreased with each Bugathon organized and
      less non-ports committers attended the events. So from now on, we
      will focus on ports (making it a Portathon) and organize a new

      <p>During the last three months there has not been so much activity
      in the USB project. Some regression issues have been reported and
      fixed. Bernd Walter reports that he has got the new USB stack
      working on ARM processors with some minor tweaks. Markus Brueffer
      reports that he is working on the USB HID parser and support. A
      current issue with the new USB stack is that the EHCI driver does
      not work on the Sparc64 architecture. If someone has got a Sparc64
      with FreeBSD 7-CURRENT on and can lend the USB project the root
      password, a serial console and a USB test device, for example a USB
      memory stick, that would be much appreciated. Another unresolved
      issue is that the ural(4) USB device driver does not always work.
      This is currently being worked on.</p>

      <p>If you want to test the new USB stack, check out the USB
      perforce tree or download the SVN version of the USB driver from my
      USB homepage. At the moment the tarballs are a little out of
      date.</p>

      the Linux compatibility environment.</url>

    <body>
      <p>Since the last status report we made good progress in improving
      the compatibility environment. We fixed more than 30 testcases on
      i386 (130 testcases = 16% still failing) and more than 60 testcases
      on amd64 (140 testcases = 17% still failing) in the Linux 2.4
      compatibility. These numbers compare FreeBSD 6.2 with -CURRENT.
      Some of those fixes are edge cases in the error handling, and some
      of them fix real issues -- e.g. hangs -- and improve the stability
      and correctness of the emulation.</p>

      <p>Regarding the Linux 2.6 compatibility there are 140 testcases
      (17%) on i386 and 150 testcases (18%) on amd64 still failing in
      -CURRENT. After fixing some showstopper problems with real
      applications, we should be able to give the 2.6 emulation a more
      widespread exposure "soon" to find more bugs and to determine the
      importance of those Linux syscalls which we did not implement
      yet.</p>

      <p>The severity of the broken testcases varies, and some of them
      will never be fixed, e.g., we will never be able to load Linux
      kernel modules into a FreeBSD kernel, being able to add swap with a
      Linux command has very low priority, and fixing stuff which is used
      by applications like IPC type 17 has high priority.</p>

      <p>Some differences in the 2.6 compatibility are because not all
      i386 changes are merged into the amd64 code, and some testcases are
      already fixed in our perforce repository but need more review
      before they can be committed to -CURRENT.</p>

      <p>We need some more testers and bug reporters. So if you have a
      little bit of time and a favorite Linux application, please play
      around with it on -CURRENT. If there is a problem, have a look at
      the wiki if we already know about it and report on
      <a
      href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-emulation">
      emulation@</a>

      . We are especially interested in reports about the 2.6
      compatibility (sysctl compat.linux.osversion=2.6.16), but only with
      the most recent -CURRENT and maybe with some patches we have in the
      perforce repository (mandatory on amd64).</p>

      <p>We thank all people who tested the changes / submitted patches
      and thus helped improving the Linux compatibility environment.</p>

      <p>Since the last status report there were improvements to the
      emu10kx driver for High Definition Audio (HDA) compatible chips.
      Some more chips are supported now and already supported chips
      should provide a better zero-configuration experience.</p>

      <p>The generic sound code got some very nice low latency changes,
      and fixes which make it multichannel/endian/format safe. We do not
      support multichannel operation yet, but this work is a prerequisite
      to work on implementing multichannel operation. This work also
      fixed some bugs which people may experience as clicks, hickups,
      truncation or similar behavior in the sound-output.</p>

      <p>So far there is no merge to 5.x or 6.x planned for this code,
      especially because there are API/ABI changes, e.g., several sysctls
      changed. People who do not care about this can download binary
      sound modules from Ariff's download page for 6.x and 5.x.</p>

      <p>The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the
      FreeBSD kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of
      networking state. This will allow for complete networking
      independence between jails on a system, including giving each jail
      its own firewall, virtual network interfaces, rate limiting,
      routing tables, and IPSEC configuration.</p>

      <p>The prototype currently virtualizes the basic INET and INET6
      kernel structures and subsystems, including the TCP machinery and
      the IPFW firewall. The focus is currently being kept on resolving
      bugs and sporadic lockups, and defining the internal and management
      APIs. It is expected that within the next month the code will
      become sufficiently complete and stable for testing by early
      adopters.</p>

      <p>In addition to other more detailed reports this is intended to
      give a summary about other ongoing or upcoming BSNMP related work.
      To collect some ideas from users and coordinate work a BSNMP TODO
      Wiki page was created. Feel free to add your ideas or let us know
      about them.</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A contributor, Tsvetan Erenditsov, has volunteered to
          implement a VLAN module for BSNMP. Shteryana is helping
          him.</li>

          <li>Sam Leffler has asked for a wireless networking monitoring
          module, which will most likely be the next module to be
          implemented.</li>

          <li>Some major work is currently going on in the main BSNMP
          tree:
          <ul>
            <li>SNMP transports have been factored out into loadable
            modules. The old port tables are still there and will remain
            at least for the next release. Later they will be removed.
            The following modules and transports are already implemented
            as loadable modules:
            <ul>
              <li>snmp_trans_udp: SNMP over UDP over IPv4, IPv6 and
              scoped IPv6</li>

              <li>snmp_trans_tcp: SNMP over TCP over IPv4, IPv6 and
              scoped IPv6</li>

              <li>snmp_trans_ldgram: SNMP over local datagram
              sockets</li>

              <li>snmp_trans_lstream: SNMP over local stream sockets</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Some I/O functions have been moved from the daemon to
            libbsnmp.</li>

            <li>libisa has been imported into the bsnmp tree. This
            library aims at easy implementation of command line tools for
            remote and local system administration with a special focus
            on administration via SNMP. The library contains command line
            parsing functions, a function for automatically handling help
            text. Actual administration modules are implemented as
            loadable modules. The atmconfig tool in the FreeBSD tree
            contains some old parts of this library.</li>

            <li>lisa_snmp is a module which implements SNMP functionality
            for libisa.</li>

            <li>lisa_snmpd is a module for remote administration of the
            bsnmpd.</li>

            <li>The config file parser of bsnmpd has been rewritten so
            that each section of the file is handled as a transaction (in
            contrast to the previous behavior where the entire file was
            one transaction).</li>

      fixes, and new features. The release notes and errata notes for
      FreeBSD 6.2 contain more specific information about what's new in
      this version. We thank the FreeBSD developer and user community for
      their efforts towards making this release possible.</p>

      <p>The Release Engineering Team also produced snapshots of FreeBSD
      CURRENT in November 2006 and January 2007. These snapshots have not
      received extensive testing, and should not be used in production
      environments. However, they can be used for testing or
      experimentation, and show the kinds of functionality that can be
      expected in future FreeBSD releases.</p>

      <p>Where have we been?! Not doing status reports, that's for sure.
      But the FreeBSD GNOME project has been very busy with regular GNOME
      releases, and other side projects. We are currently shipping GNOME
      2.16.2 in the ports tree, and we are testing GNOME 2.17.5 in the
      <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/develfaq.html">
      MarcusCom</a>

      tree.</p>

      <p>Most recently, work has completed on a cleanup of the FreeBSD
      backend to libgtop. This module has needed a lot of work, and
      should now be reporting correct system statistics. The cleaned up
      version is currently being tested in the MarcusCom tree, and will
      make it into the FreeBSD ports tree along with GNOME 2.18.</p>

      <p>The GStreamer framework has been taken out of direct
      <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-gnome">
      gnome@</a>

      maintainership, and put under a new
      <a
      href="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-multimedia">
      multimedia@</a>

      umbrella. This will give multimedia-savvy developers a chance to
      collaborate on this important piece of the GNOME Desktop along with
      other important audio and video components.</p>

      <p>The biggest accomplishment of 2006 for the FreeBSD GNOME team
      had to have been the port of
      <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</a>

      . This effort was started to give FreeBSD users a richer desktop
      experience. Since the initial FreeBSD release of HAL with GNOME
      2.16, it has been incorporated into the FreeBSD release of KDE
      3.5.5 as well as PC-BSD 1.3. The FreeBSD backend has also made it
      upstream into the HAL git repository so future releases of HAL will
      have FreeBSD support out-of-the-box.</p>

      <p>Finally, it is with sadness that we say good-bye to one of our
      team members. Adam Weinberger stepped down from the FreeBSD GNOME
      team to save lives instead (priorities, man!). His splash screens
      and grammar nit-picking will be missed.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Now that HAL has been ported to FreeBSD, there is a strong
      desire to see
      <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">
      NetworkManager</a>

      ported. The big parts will be porting NM to use our 80211

      <p>Interrupt filtering is a new method to handle interrupts in
      FreeBSD that retains backward compatibility with the previous
      models (FAST and ITHREAD), while improving over them in some
      aspects. With interrupt filtering, the interrupt handler is divided
      into 2 parts: the filter (that checks if the actual interrupt
      belongs to a device) and a private per-handler ithread (that is
      scheduled in case some blocking work has to be done). The main
      benefits of this work are:
      <ul>
        <li>Feedback from filters (the operating system finally knows
        what's the state of an event and can react consequently).</li>

        <li>Lower latency/overhead for shared interrupt line.</li>

        <li>Previous experiments with interrupt filtering showed an
        increase in performance against the plain ithread model in some
        cases.</li>

        <li>General shrink of the machine dependent code - part of the
        interrupting handling code was turned into machine independent
        code.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>During the last quarter many improvements were made up to the
      point where 3 archs (i386, amd64 and arm) are reported to work, and
      the project can be considered feature complete.</p>

      <p>I definitely want to make it part of the 7.0 release.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation ended 2006 raising over $100,000. We
      received commitments for another $55,000 in donations for the Fall
      Fundraiser. We fell short of our goal of raising $200,000. But, we
      are working hard to fill this gap, early in 2007, so we can
      continue with the same level of support for the project and
      community. Please go to
      <a href="http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donate/">
      http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donate/</a>

      to find out how to make a donation to the foundation.</p>

      <p>We added a donors page to our website to acknowledge our
      generous donors. We negotiated and are now actively managing a
      joint technology project with NLNet and the University of Zagreb to
      develop virtualized network stack support for FreeBSD. We sponsored
      AsiaBSDCon and are now accepting travel grant applications for this
      conference.</p>

      <p>We are working to upgrade the project's network testbed with
      10Gigabit interconnects. Cisco has generously donated a 10Gigabit
      switch and we have received network adapters from Myricom,
      Neterion, Intel, and Chelsio. Adapters from other vendors are being
      solicited so that we can do interoperability testing.</p>

      <p>The ports count has jumped to 16347. The PR count, despite a
      jump, has gone back down to around 700.</p>

      <p>Not much work has been committed on the ports infrastructure due
      to the long 6.2 release cycle. However, many test runs have been
      done for several upcoming features, such as making sure that ports
      will work with the new release of gcc (4.1), and do not have
      /usr/X11R6 hard-coded into them. The intention of the latter is to
      move all ports to $LOCALBASE, which can then be selected by the
      user. This should help consistency going forwards, albeit at the
      cost of a one-time conversion.</p>

      <p>GNOME was updated to 2.16 during the release cycle.</p>

      <p>In addition, we are in the process of moving the FORTRAN default
      from f77 to gfortran. See the ports mailing list for details.</p>

      <p>The new xorg ports are still being worked on as well; they are
      intended to all live in $LOCALBASE. Hopefully this can get done in
      the early 6.3 development cycle. See the wiki for more
      information.</p>

      <p>A new version of the ports Tinderbox code is available, which is
      mostly a bugfix release.</p>

      <p>We have also added Pav Lucistnik as a new portmgr member, who we
      hope will help us work on the portmgr PR backlog. Welcome!</p>

      <p>We have also added 8 new committers since the last report.</p>

      <p>linimon continues to work on resetting committers who are no
      longer interested in their ports; as well, several ports commit
      bits have been stored for safekeeping. This is part of an attempt

      maintained within FreeBSD. The Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup

      <p>Michael Richardson has been spearheading work to improve the
      crypto subsystem used by various parts of the kernel including Fast
      IPSec and geli. This work is sponsored by Hifn and has been
      happening outside the CVS repository. A main focus of this work is
      to add support for higher-level hardware operations that can
      significantly improve the performance of IPSec and SSL
      protocols.</p>

      <p>Results of this work are now being readied for CVS. These
      redesign the core/driver APIs to use the kobj facilities and recast
      software crypto drivers as pseudo devices. The changes greatly
      improve the system and permit new functionality such as specifying
      which crypto device to use when multiple are available. The
      redesign will also enable load balancing of crypto work across
      multiple devices and the addition of virtual crypto sessions by
      which small operations can be done in software when the overhead to
      set up a hardware device is too costly.</p>

      <p>In addition to the changes to the core crypto system several
      crypto drivers have been updated to improve their operation. Top of
      this list is the hifn(4) driver where many longstanding bugs have
      been fixed for 7955/756 parts.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD is running multi-user on a variety of Gateworks Avila
      boards with most of the on-board devices supported. These include
      the compact flash/IDE slot, wired network interfaces, realtime
      clock, and environmental sensors. Several different minipci cards
      have been tested including those supported by the ath(4) and
      hifn(4) drivers. Remaining devices that need support are the
      onboard flash, optional 4-port network switch, and optional USB
      interface. Crypto acceleration for IXP425 parts is planned but will
      likely be done at a later time.</p>

      <p>The Network Processor Engine (NPE) support is done with an
      entirely new replacement for the Intel Access Layer (IAL). The most
      important hardware facilities are supported (e.g. the hardware Q
      manager) and the wired NIC driver was also done from scratch. The
      resulting code is approximately 1/10th the number of lines of the
      equivalent IAL code.</p>

      <p>The ZFS file system works quite well on FreeBSD now. The first
      patchset has already been published on the
      <a herf="http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-fs">
      freebsd-fs@FreeBSD.org mailing list</a>

      .</p>

      <p>All file system methods are already implemented (except
      ACL-related). Basically all stress tests I tried work, even under
      very high load. There is still a problem with memory allocation,
      which can get out of control, but from what I know the SUN guys
      also work on this.</p>

      <p>Recently I have been working on a file system regression test
      suite. From what I found, there are no such test suites for free.
      I've already more than 3000 tests and I'm testing correctness of
      most file system related syscalls (chflags, chmod, chown, link,
      mkdir, mkfifo, open, rename, rmdir, symlink, truncate, unlink). I'm
      also working to make it usable on other operating systems (like
      Solaris, where it already works and Linux).</p>

      <p>Few days ago I also (almost) finished NFS support. You can't use
      the 'zfs share' command yet, but you can export file systems via
      /etc/exports and you can also access snapshots. It was quite hard,
      because snapshots are separate file systems and after exporting the
      main file system, we need to also serve data from snapshots under
      it.</p>

      <p>The one big thing which is missing is ACL support. This is not
      an easy task, because we first have to make some decisions.
      Currently we use POSIX ACLs in our UFS, but the market is moving
      slowly to NTFS/NFSv4-type ACLs. In Solaris they use POSIX ACLs for
      UFS and NFSv4-type ACLs for ZFS and we probably also want to use
      NFSv4-type ACLs in our ZFS, which requires some work outside
      ZFS.</p>

      <p>TrustedBSD priv(9) replaces suser(9) as an in-kernel interface
      for checking privilege in FreeBSD 7.x. Each privilege check now
      takes a specific named privilege. This allows both centralization
      of jail logic relating to privilege, which is currently distributed
      around the kernel at the point of each call to suser(9), and allows
      instrumentation of the privilege logic by the MAC Framework. Two
      new MAC Framework entry points, one to grant and the other to limit
      privilege, are now available, providing fine-grained control of
      kernel privilege by policy modules. This lays the kernel
      infrastructure groundwork for further refinement and extension of
      the kernel privilege model. The priv(9) implementation has been
      committed to FreeBSD 7-CURRENT.</p>

      <p>Most work on the MAC Framework during this period, other than as

      <ul>
        <li>Add two new entry points allowing MAC Framework policy

        <li>A sample mac_priv(4) policy module has been created

        <li>Correct a bug in which the original ifnet label was copied to
        user space via ioctl, rather than the thread-local copy.</li>

        <li>mac_enforce_subsystem debugging sysctls removed, as some
        policies rely on access control checks being called even when
        non-enforcing (specifically, information flow related
        policies).</li>

        <li>Break out mac.h include file into mac.h (user API, system
        calls) and mac_framework.h (in-kernel interface to the MAC
        Framework). Move non-user MAC include files from src/sys to

    <title>Automatic TCP Send and Receive Socket Buffer Sizing</title>

    <body>
      <p>Normally the socket buffers are static (either derived from
      global defaults or set with setsockopt) and do not adapt to real
      network conditions. Two things happen: a) your socket buffers are
      too small and you can't reach the full potential of the network
      between both hosts; b) your socket buffers are too big and you
      waste a lot of kernel memory for data just sitting around.</p>

      <p>With automatic TCP send and receive socket buffers we can start
      with a small buffer and quickly grow it in parallel with the TCP
      congestion window to match real network conditions.</p>

      <p>FreeBSD has a default 32K send socket buffer. This supports a
      maximal transfer rate of only slightly more than 2Mbit/s on a 100ms
      RTT trans-continental link. Or at 200ms just above 1Mbit/s. With
      TCP send buffer auto scaling and the default values below it
      supports 20Mbit/s at 100ms and 10Mbit/s at 200ms. That's an
      improvement of factor 10, or 1000%. For the receive side it looks
      slightly better with a default of 64K buffer size.</p>

      <p>The automatic send buffer sizing patch is currently running on
      one half of the FTP.FreeBSD.ORG cluster w/o any problems so far.
      Against this machine with the automatic receive buffer sizing patch
      I can download at 5.7 MBytes per second. Without patch it maxed out
      at 1.6 MBytes per second as the delay bandwidth product became
      equal to the static socket buffer size without hitting the limits
      of the physical link between the machines. My test machine is about
      35ms from that FTP.FreeBSD.ORG and connected through a moderately
      loaded 100Mbit Internet link.</p>

      <p>New sysctls are:
      <ul>
        <li>net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_auto=1 (enabled)</li>

        <li>net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_inc=8192 (8K, step size)</li>

      <p>Work on wireless support has continued to evolve in the public
      CVS tree while other work has been going on behind the scenes in
      the developer's perforce repository.</p>

      <p>Support was recently added to HEAD for half- and quarter-rate
      channels as found in the 4.9 GHz FCC Public Safety Band. This work
      was a prerequisite to adding similar support in the 900 MHz band as
      found in Ubiquiti's SR9 cards. Adding this functionality was
      straightforward due to the design of the net80211 layer, requiring
      only some additions to handle the unusual mapping between
      frequencies and IEEE channel numbers. The ath(4) driver currently
      supports hardware capable of operating on half- and quarter-rate
      channels.</p>

      <p>Kip Macy recently made significant advances preparing legacy
      drivers for the re-architected net80211 layer that has been
      languishing in perforce. With his efforts this code is nearly ready
      for public testing after which it can be merged into CVS. Our goal
      is to complete this merge in time for the 7.x branch (otherwise it
      will be forced to wait for 8.0 before it appears in a public
      release). This revised net80211 layer includes advanced station
      mode facilities such as background scanning and roaming and support
      for Atheros' SuperG extensions. Getting the revised scanning work
      into CVS will greatly simplify public distribution of the Virtual
      AP (VAP) code as a patch as well as enable addition of 802.11n
      support.</p>

      <p>Benjamin Close is working on support for the Intel 3945 parts
      commonly found in laptops. The work is going on in the perforce
      repository with public code drops for testing.</p>

      <p>Atheros PCI/Cardbus support was updated with a new HAL that
      fixes a few minor issues and corrects a problem that kept AR2424
      parts from working. The new HAL also enables more efficient use of
      the hardware keycache for TKIP keys; on newer hardware you can now
      support up to 57 stations without faulting keys into the cache.
      Support for the latest 802.11n parts found in the new Lenovo and
      Apple laptops (among others) is in development; initial release
      will support only legacy operation.</p>

      <p>Support for Atheros USB devices is coming. Atheros has agreed to
      license their firmware with the same license applied to the HAL
      which means it can be committed to the tree and distributed as part
      of releases. The driver is still in development.</p>

      <p>wpa_supplicant and hostapd were updated to the latest stable
      build releases from Jouni Malinen. Shortly the in-tree code base
      will switch to the 0.5.x tree which will bring in much new
      functionality including dynamic VLAN tagging that will be
      especially useful once the multi-bss support is available.</p>

      <p>The support for injection of raw 802.11 frames was committed to
      HEAD. This work was done in collaboration with Andrea Bittau. At
      this point there are no plans to commit this to the STABLE branch
      as it requires API changes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This report covers &os;-related projects between January and March
      2011.  It is the first of the four reports planned for 2011.  During
      this quarter, the work was focused on releasing the new minor
      versions of &os;, 7.4 and 8.2, which were released in February 2011.
      Currently, the project is starting to work on the next major version,
      9.0.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! This report
      contains 34 entries and we hope you enjoy reading it.</p>

    <p>Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
      between April and June 2011 is July 15th, 2011.</p>

      <p>The bugmeister team is happy to welcome Eitan Adler (eadler@) as
	the newest GNATS-only contributor.  Eitan has been helping triage
	new bugs as they come in, as well as making good progress on many
	of the older bugs, closing duplicates and obsolete bugs and
	contacting submitters for extra information where necessary.  For
	the first time in a long time we managed to get below 6000 open
	PRs, in no small part due to Eitan's efforts.  Welcome aboard!</p>

      <p>PRs continue to be classified as they arrive, by adding 'tags'
	to the subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem
	involved, or man page references for userland PRs.  Reports are
	generated from these nightly, grouping related PRs into one place,
	sorted by tag or man page.  This allows an interested party working
	in one area or on one subsystem to easily find related bugs and
	issues in the same area, which has proven quite effective in
	getting some of the older bug reports closed.  These reports can all
	be found by following the third link above.</p>

      <p>We continue to look for ideas for other reports that may help
	improve the PR closure rate.  If you have any suggestions for
	reports which would contribute positively to the way you work,
	please email bugmeister@ and we shall try to produce such a
	report.</p>

      <p>Our clearance rate of PRs, especially in kern and bin, seems to
	be improving.  The number of non-ports PRs has stayed almost
	constant since the last status report.</p>

      <p>As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue
	is welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet.  We are
	always looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in
	triaging incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing
	problems, or simply helping with the database housekeeping
	(identifying duplicate PRs, ones that have already been resolved,
	etc).  This is a great way of getting more involved with &os;!</p>

      <p>We created our <a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/documents/Budget2011.pdf">
	2011 budget</a>.  Some of our plans for 2011 include spending
	$125,000 on project development and $75,000 on equipment to
	build up &os; facilities in three locations.</p>

      <p>We were proud to be a sponsor for AsiaBSDCon 2011 in Tokyo.  We
	also committed to sponsoring BSDCan 2011 in May, and EuroBSDCon
	2011 in October.  The Foundation was also represented at SCALE in
	Los Angeles, Indiana LinuxFest in Indianapolis, and Flourish in
	Chicago.</p>

      <p>Completed Foundation-funded projects: <a
	  href="http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/announcements.shtml#Swinburne">
	  Five New TCP Congestion Control Algorithms project</a> by
	Swinburne University and Resource Containers project by

      <p>In February we visited companies in the Bay Area that use &os;.
	Our goal was to promote &os;, better understand their interests and
	needs, and help facilitate stronger relationships between these
	companies and the Project.  The presentations we gave included the
	benefits of &os;, Project road-map, potential areas of
	collaboration, case studies, and how the Foundation supports the
	project.  By visiting in person we were able to show our commitment
	to the Project and respond directly to questions and concerns they
	may have had.  We were pleased with the positive responses we
	received and plan on visiting more companies in the future.</p>

      <p>We are funding two new projects.  The first project is
	Implementing Support of GEM, KMS, and DRI for Intel Drivers by
	Konstantin Belousov.  The second is Improving the Maturity of IPv6
	Support of &os; and PC-BSD by Bjoern Zeeb.</p>

      <p>We continued our work on infrastructure projects to beef up
	hardware for package-building, network-testing, etc.  This includes
	purchasing equipment as well as managing equipment donations.</p>

      <p>Stop by and visit with us at BSDCan (May 13-14) and SouthEast
	LinuxFest (June 10-12).</p>

      <p>The work above as well as many other tasks we do for the
	project, couldn't be done without donations.  Please help us by
	making a donation or asking your company to make a donation.  We
	would be happy to send marketing literature to you or your company.

      <p>DIFFUSE is a system enabling &os;'s IPFW firewall subsystem to
	classify IP traffic based on statistical traffic properties.</p>

      <p>With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths
	or inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML
	(machine learning) to classify flows into classes.  In addition to
	traditional packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be
	expressed in terms of traffic statistics or classes identified by
	ML classification.  This can be helpful when direct packet
	inspection is problematic (perhaps for administrative reasons, or
	because port numbers do not reliably identify applications).</p>

      <p>DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow
	information and classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act
	on such traffic (e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to
	its class.  This allows for distributed architectures, where
	classification at one location in your network is used to control
	fire-walling or rate-shaping actions at other locations.</p>

      <p>DIFFUSE is a set of patches for &os;-CURRENT.  It can be
	downloaded from the project's web site.  The web site also contains
	a more comprehensive introduction, including application examples,
	links to related work and documentation.</p>

      <p>In February 2011 we released DIFFUSE v0.2.2.  This release
	contains a number of bug fixes and new features.  Most notably since
	version 0.2 there is a tool to build classifier models, and there
	is a feature module and classifier model to classify Skype
	traffic.</p>

      <p>We hope to release DIFFUSE v0.3 soon.  Keep an eye on the
	freebsd-ipfw and freebsd-net mailing lists for project-related
	announcements.</p>

      <p>On March 14th, sysinstall was replaced on the 9.0 snapshot media
	by a new, modular installer called BSDInstall.  This adds support
	for a wide variety of new features while simplifying the
	installation process.  Testing before the 9.0 release will be very
	much appreciated -- CD and memory stick images for a variety of
	platforms are linked from the BSDInstall wiki page.</p>

      <p>Interesting features:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Install CD media are always live CDs</li>
	<li>Installations spanning multiple disks</li>
	<li>Wireless setup</li>
	<li>GPT disk formatting</li>
	<li>Virtualization friendly: can install from a live system onto
	  disk images</li>
	<li>Easily hackable and more modular than sysinstall</li>
	<li>Greater flexibility: shells available throughout the
	  installation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Work is presently ongoing to integrate this installer with the

      <p>AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the
	Andrew Project at Carnegie-Mellon University.  The OpenAFS client
	implementation has not been particularly useful on &os; since the
	&os; 4.X releases.  Work covered in previous reports brought the
	OpenAFS client to a useful form on 9.0-CURRENT, though with some
	rough edges.  Since our last report, we have fixed several bugs that
	were impacting usability, and we expect the upcoming 1.6.0 release
	to be usable for regular client workloads (though not heavy load).
	Accordingly, we have submitted packaging for inclusion in the Ports
	Collection (PR ports/152467).</p>

      <p>The latest version of portmaster contains numerous improvements
	aimed at large-scale enterprise users.  Particularly, support for
	the --index-only/--packages-only code has been significantly
	improved.  Some of the highlights include:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>New --update-if-newer option which takes a list of ports
	  and/or a glob pattern on the command line and only updates those
	  that are out of date.  This feature is very useful for ensuring
	  that the packages needed for updating a system are all available
	  and up to date on the package building system.</li>

	<li>The portmaster.rc file can now be stored in the same
	  directory as the script itself, which aids in shared access to
	  the script (for example over an NFS mount)</li>

      <p>Following (separate) discussions on the mailing lists I have
	made patches to add DVB and V4L2 ioctl translation support to the
	Linux compatibility layer, allowing Linux apps like SageTV, Skype,
	and Flash to use DVB/ATSC tuners and webcams that previously only
	worked for native &os; apps. (Most of this hardware uses Linux
	drivers via the <a

      <task>Handle the remaining ioctls that (I think) are not used by
	DVB tuners/cameras supported by webcamd (it only supports USB
	devices, the unhandled ioctls mostly have to do with video overlays
	and hardware MPEG2 decoding on analog or DVB tuners, features that
	AFAIK don't exist on USB hardware.)</task>

      <task>Make the DVB support a port because there were concerns
	putting it in base due to the LGPL in one of the header files even

      <p>A new RAID GEOM class (geom_raid) was added to &os; 9-CURRENT, to
	replace ataraid(4) in supporting various BIOS-based software RAIDs.
	Unlike ataraid(4) this implementation does not depend on legacy
	ata(4) subsystem and can be used with any disk drivers, including
	new CAM-based ones (ahci(4), siis(4), mvs(4) and ata(4) with
	`options ATA_CAM`).  To make code more readable and extensible, this
	implementation follows modular design, including a core part and two
	sets of modules, implementing support for different metadata
	formats and RAID levels.</p>

      <p>Support for such popular metadata formats is now implemented:
	Intel, JMicron, NVIDIA, Promise (also used by AMD/ATI) and
	SiliconImage.</p>

      <p>Such RAID levels are now supported: RAID0, RAID1, RAID1E,
	RAID10, SINGLE, CONCAT.</p>

      <p>For any all of these RAID levels and metadata formats this class
	supports full cycle of volume operations: reading, writing,
	creation, deletion, disk removal and insertion, rebuilding, dirty
	shutdown detection and resynchronization, bad sector recovery,
	faulty disks tracking, hot-spare disks.  For Intel and Promise
	formats there is support for multiple volumes per disk set.</p>

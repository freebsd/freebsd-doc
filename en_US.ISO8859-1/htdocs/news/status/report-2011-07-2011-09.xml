      <p>We managed to update the German version of the documentation
	just in time to get it included in the upcoming 9.0-RELEASE.  The
	website translations were also kept in sync with the ones on
	FreeBSD.org.</p>

      <p>We tried to re-activate committers who did not contribute for
	some time but most of them are currently unable to free up enough
	time.  We hope to gain fresh contributor blood as we are getting
	occasional reports about bugs and grammar in the German
	translation.</p>

      <p>The ports tree slowly moves up closer to the 23,000 mark.  The PR count
	still remains at about 1000.</p>

      <p>In Q2 we added 4 new committers, but took in 6 commit bits for safe
	keeping.</p>

      <p>The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an
	ongoing basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the
	ports tree, as well as providing QA runs for major ports updates.
	Of note, -exp runs were done for:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Python update</li>
	<li>Boost updates</li>
	<li>Gtk3 updates</li>
	<li>clang testing</li>
	<li>pkgng testing</li>
	<li>testing ruby19</li>
	<li>setting the default fortran to lang/gcc46</li>
	<li>setting apache22 as default</li>
	<li>setting the default LDFLAGS in CONFIGURE_ENV</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Work continues to refine the new build master pointyhat-west.  An
	upgrade to -current done in September has proven problematic.  We
	have enlisted ISC and Josh Paetzel to try to determine a fix.  In
	the meantime, the source will be downgraded to RELENG_9.</p>

      <p>The portsmon instance is being re-homed at Yahoo.  Users should
	not see any changes.  The new instance is currently visible at
	portsmonj.FreeBSD.org but will soon take on the
	portsmon.FreeBSD.org name.  The team would like to express its
	appreciation to TDC A/S for the loan of the existing machine for
	several years.</p>

      <p>Work is underway to create a new QAT instance at NYI/NJ.</p>

      <p>portmgr also assisted in setting up a sparc64 machine for
	general develop access at Yahoo.</p>

      <p>Thanks to on-site work by Sean Bruno and Ben Haga, we once again
	have access to the powerpc build machine at ISC, and powerpc builds
	have been restarted.  They also helped us get one more i386 machine
	back online.</p>

      <p>linimon is working on a set of scripts to more quickly produce
	pre-configured PXEboot images for package build nodes.</p>

      <p>The update of __FreeBSD_version in param.h to 1000000 proved very
	disruptive to the ports tree, triggering lots of bad assumption in
	code that interpreted it as &os; 1.  A great deal of work has
	gone into identifying the instances of broken code and fixing and
	upstreaming them.  While this is taking place, one recommended
	workaround is to set your version to 999999.</p>

      <p>ZFSguru is a newly designed Network Attached Storage operating
	system, much like FreeNAS.  The difference is that ZFSguru
	focuses heavily on ZFS and user friendly operation, and uses a full
	&os; distribution with no elements stripped down.  This allows
	people new to &os; and UNIX in general to access the power
	of ZFS, while still allowing more advanced users to tweak their NAS
	with additional functionality and use it as a normal &os;
	distribution.</p>

      <p>Started a little over a year ago, the ZFSguru project is making
	good progress.  It should already be one of the most user friendly
	distributions focused on ZFS, and sports some very unique features.
	The advanced ZFS benchmarking and convenient Root-on-ZFS
	installation are good examples.  Priority is given to finishing the
	missing core functionality, and extending the number of available
	service addons which currently are limited to iSCSI-target and
	VirtualBox extensions.</p>

      <p>The aim of this project is to create a new layer that sits
	between UMA and the virtual memory system managing chunks of kernel
	virtual memory on the order of 2 to 4 MB in size.  At the end of the
	work, UMA page_alloc() would no longer call directly into the VM
	system.  It would instead call into this new layer.  Thus,
	uma_large_malloc() and uma_large_free() would no longer be
	immediately allocating and deallocating kernel virtual memory.  This
	results in a gain in terms of performances (there is a relatively
	high cost in the approach adopted until now), and also in terms of
	reduction of fragmentation (the VM system uses a first-fit policy of
	allocation so there is room for improvements).</p>

	Rewriting it in this way helps to remove several hacks from
	incoming packet processing, simplifies some code, makes CARP
	addresses more sane from the viewpoint of routing daemons such as
	quagga/zebra and closes many CARP-related PRs in GNATS.  It also
	brings support for a single redundant address on the subnet, the
	thing that is called "carpdev feature" in OpenBSD, long awaited in
	&os;.</p>

      <p>For this moment I have a patch against head/ that compiles and
	works in my test environment that I am going to deploy soon on some
	of servers under my control.</p>

      <p>The patch has been reviewed by Bjoern Zeeb (bz@).</p>

      <p>DIFFUSE enables &os;'s IPFW firewall subsystem to classify IP
	traffic based on statistical traffic properties.</p>

      <p>With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths
	or inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML
	(machine learning) to classify flows into classes.  In addition to
	traditional packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be
	expressed in terms of traffic statistics or classes identified by
	ML classification.  This can be helpful when direct packet
	inspection is problematic (perhaps for administrative reasons, or
	because port numbers do not reliably identify applications).</p>

      <p>DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow
	information and classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act
	on such traffic (e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to
	its class.  This allows for distributed architectures, where
	classification at one location in your network is used to control
	fire-walling or rate-shaping actions at other locations.</p>

      <p>The &os; Foundation has funded the Centre for Advanced
	Internet Architectures at Swinburne University of Technology to
	undertake the DIFFUSED (DIFFUSE for freebsD) project, which aims to
	refine our publicly released DIFFUSE prototype and integrate all
	components of the architecture into &os;.</p>

      <p>The project is progressing well in the diffused_head project
	branch of the &os; Subversion repository, and is due to be
	completed by the end of October 2011.  Once the project is
	completed, the code will be merged from the project branch into the
	head branch.  An MFC of the code to 8.x and 9.x should be possible
	after an appropriate amount of soak time has elapsed.</p>

      <p>The 10th anniversary European BSD Conference was organized in
	Maarssen, The Netherlands with more than 250 registered visitors.
	There were many interesting tutorials, including introductions to
	DTrace and working with Netgraph.  It featured 26 high-quality talks
	and 2 keynote speakers on various topics related to &os;,
	OpenBSD, NetBSD, or even MINIX: OpenBSD PF, NetBSD NPF, IPv6
	support in &os;, virtualization in the BSD domain, recent
	developments in OpenSSH, exploration of the recent FreeNAS, system
	management with ZFS, practical capabilities for UNIX known as
	Capsicum.</p>

      <p>It also had a dedicated track for the attendees of the &os;
	developer summit, where one could learn more about what is
	happening currently in the Project.  We had presentations on the new
	package management solution, Google Summer of Code 2011, a stacked

    <body>
      <p>On September 5, we held another documentation sprint on IRC
	channel #bsddocs to discuss various issues that are important for
	the whole &os; documentation community.  We talked about the
	status of the planned documentation repository conversion to SVN
	and the status of the XML docbook conversion.  At that point in
	time, we did not have any documentation regarding the new
	bsdinstaller in the upcoming release, which would have been very
	bad for users that were trying to install the release.  Luckily, a
	small team formed quickly to start working on a new bsdinstall
	chapter from scratch using a separate Google code repository that
	gjb@ had set up.</p>

      <p>Some of the topics we discussed were moved forward and their
	status was revisited at EuroBSDcon's devsummit documentation
	session.  Before the end of the conference, we had a new bsdinstall
	chapter committed into the official documentation tree, thanks to
	the efforts put into the new chapter by Gavin Atkinson, Warren
	Block, and Glen Barber.  Garrett Cooper provided valuable
	instructions on the various installation methods that are possible
	with the new bsdinstaller.  Thanks to all who helped make this a
	reality.</p>

      <p>It is nice to see that the things we talked about at the

      <p>ZRouter.org is a young project that aims to produce

	At the present time ZRouter.org is able to build working firmware
	for:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>D-Link DAP-1350</li>
	<li>D-Link DIR-320</li>

      <p>The Foundation sponsored KyivBSD 2011 which was held in Kiev,
	Ukraine on September 24.  We were represented at Ohio LinuxFest in
	Columbus, Ohio.  And, we approved six travel grants for EuroBSDCon.
	Stop by and visit us at the &os; booth during LISA '11, December
	7-8, in Boston, MA.</p>

      <p>Three Foundation funded projects were completed during this
	period: implementing xlocale APIs to enable porting libc++ by David
	Chisnall, implementing DIFFUSE for &os; by Swinburne University,
	and adding GEM, KMS, and DRI support for Intel drivers by
	Konstantin Belousov.</p>

      <p>We published our <a
	href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/2011Aug-newsletter.shtml">
	semi-annual newsletter</a>.  We purchased servers and other
	hardware for the &os; co-location centers at Sentex and
	NYI.</p>

      <p>The work above, as well as many other tasks which we do for the
	&os; Project, could not be done without donations.  Please help us

      <p>The Release Engineering Team has been coordinating the upcoming
	&os; 9.0-RELEASE.  Thanks to work done by many of the
	developers. The release, though delayed, is taking the shape
	nicely.  We have reached the stage of doing the second
	Release Candidate.  At this time we expect to have one more
	Release Candidate, to be followed by the final release itself.</p>

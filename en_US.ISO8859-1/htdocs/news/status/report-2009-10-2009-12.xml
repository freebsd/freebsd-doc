      <p>Existing ata(4) infrastructure, which has been around many years,
      has various problems and limitations when compared to modern
      controllers/device support. Although the CAM subsystem (used for SCSI)
      is almost as old as ata(4), it is more eligible to solve the current
      problems. To reduce code duplication and better support border cases
      such as ATAPI and SAS, we have started to develop a new CAM based
      ATA implementation.</p>

      <p>As such, CAM infrastructure has been extended to support different
      transports. New transport has been implemented to support PATA/SATA
	buses. To support ATA disks, a new CAM driver (ada) has been written. ATAPI
      devices are supported by existing SCSI drivers cd, da, sa, etc. To
	support SATA port-multipliers another new CAM driver (pmp) has been written. To
      support most featured and widespread SATA controllers, new drivers
      ahci(4) and siis(4) have been developed.</p>

      <p>To support legacy ATA controllers, a kernel option ATA_CAM has been
      added. When used, it makes all ata(4) controllers directly
      available to CAM, deprecating ata(4) peripheral drivers and external
      APIs. To make this possible, ata(4) code has been heavily refactored,
      making controller driver API stricter.</p>

      <p>Command queuing support gives new ATA implementation up to
      double performance benefit on some workloads, with 20-30% improvement
      quite usual.</p>

      <p>SATA Port Multiplier support makes it easy to build fast and
	cheap storage with huge capacities, by using dozens of SATA drives
      in one system or external enclosures,</p>

      <p>Some of that code has been presented in the recently released &os; 8.0-RELEASE but
	8-STABLE now includes a much improved version.</p>

      <p>Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD
      licensed. It has been ported from Linux to &os; in October and we have been
      posting patches and test builds periodically since then. Chromium
      works well on &os; &mdash; it is very fast and stable but there
      are a handful of rough edges that need to be polished up. Two
      remaining bugs should probably be fixed before releasing a
      chromium-devel port. We are looking for volunteers to test and
      maintain this port to make this BSD browser a viable option on
      &os; desktop systems.</p>

      <p>I have been adding a small intent log to SoftUpdates to
      eliminate the requirement for fsck after an unclean shutdown. This
      work has been funded by Yahoo!, iXsystems, and Juniper. Kirk
      McKusick has been aiding me with design critiques and helping me
      better understand SoftUpdates.</p>

      <p>Extensive testing by myself and Peter Holm has yielded a stable
      patch. Current users are encouraged to follow the instructions
      posted to the current@FreeBSD.org mailing list to verify stability in your own workloads.
      Updates are forthcoming and it is expected to be merged to
      9.0-CURRENT before the end of January. Ports to older versions of &os;
      will be available in SVN under alternate branches. Official
      backports will be decided by re@ when 9.0-CURRENT is stable.</p>

      <p>The changes are fully backwards and forwards compatible as there
      are very few metadata changes to the filesystem. The journal may be
      enabled or disabled on existing FFS filesystems using tunefs(8).
      The log consumes 64 MB of space at maximum and fsck time is
      bounded by the size of the log rather than the size of the
      filesystem. Other details are available in my technical
      journal.</p>

      <p>Most of the recent activity has been dealing with the 8.0-RELEASE
      process. As an experiment, we have tried to decouple the ports QA
      timeline as much as possible from the src QA timeline. Although
      this meant that the impact on people actively maintaining and using
      ports has been much less than in previous releases, it still has not
      solved the problem of the release going out with a stale set of
      packages. We are still trying to come up with a better solution for
      the problem.</p>

      <p>The ports count is over 21,000. The PR count jumped to over
      1,000 but is now back to around 950.</p>

      <p>We are currently building packages for amd64-6, amd64-7,
      amd64-8, i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, i386-9, ia64-8, sparc64-7, and
      sparc64-8. This represents the addition of i386-9 and ia64-8 since
      the last report.</p>

      <p>There has been some discussion of when to drop regular package
      builds for 6.X but no decision has been made yet. The cluster and
      the port managers are struggling to keep up with so many branches being
      active all at the same time.</p>

      <p>Mark Linimon continues to make progress on the cluster nodes.
      Almost every node that does not have a hard disk failure is now
      online. In addition, he continues to make progress debugging
      problems that occasionally take nodes offline.</p>

      <p>The next task is to characterize the overall performance of the
      build cluster. The question has been asked of us, "what would it
      take to speed up package builds?" There is no one simple answer. It
      is not merely a matter of having a larger number of package
      building machines, so before asking for funding we first need to
      identify the current bottlenecks. While we are starting to
      understand the problems on the nodes, the problems on the dispatch
      machine itself are much harder. Complicating the matter is that
      there are several periodic processes (ZFS backup, ZFS expiration,
      and errorlog compression, among others) that can combine to slow
      that machine significantly. The simultaneous interaction of all these
      is proving difficult to quantify.</p>

      <p>Between Pav Lucistnik and Martin Wilke, many more experimental ports runs have
      been completed and committed.</p>

      <p>We have added 3 new committers since the last report, and 1
      older one has rejoined us.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>We are still trying to set up ports tinderboxes that can be
      made available to committers for pre-testing.</task>

      <task>Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR
      assigned to committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is
      helping to keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more
      to get the ports in the shape they really need to be in.</task>

      <task>Although we have added many maintainers, we still have more
      than 4,700 unmaintained ports. (See, for instance, the list on
      portsmon. The percentage remains steady at just over 22%.) We are
      always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few
      unmaintained ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and especially
      sparc64 lag behind i386, and we need more testers for those.</task>

      <p>The main thing that has taken place since the last Status Report
      is that I have gotten to the bottom of the remaining PCI problems
      with Sun Fire V215/V245 and support for these has been completed
      and since r202023 now is part of 9.0-CURRENT. With some luck it will also
      be part of the upcoming 7.3-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>Some other news:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two bugs in the NFS server causing unaligned access and
        thus panics on sparc64 and all other architectures with strict
        alignment requirements (basically all Tier-2 ones) have been
        fixed. There likely will be a 8.0-RELEASE Erratum Notice released
        for these.</li>

        <li>&os; has been adopted to the changed firmware of newer Sun
        Fire V480 (those equipped with version 7 Schizo bridges) and has been
        reported to now run fine on these. The necessary change will be
        part of 7.3-RELEASE. Unfortunately, using the on-board NICs in
        older models of Sun Fire V480 (at least those equipped with
        version 4 Schizo bridges) under &os; still leads to the firmware
        issuing a FATAL RESET due to what appears to be a CPU bug, which
        needs to be worked around.</li>

        <li>Work on supporting Sun Fire V1280 has been started but still
        is in very early stages. Unfortunately, these are rather quirky
        machines. After solving two firmware specialties the loader now
        is able to boot the kernel but the latter currently still fails
        in early cycles as trying to take the trap table over from the
        firmware results in a solid hang.</li>

      <p>Recently, a bunch of new device IDs have been added for the
	u3g(4) cellular wireless driver; the list should be comparable now with
      other operating systems around. A lot of these devices have a
      feature where the unit first attaches as a disk or CD-ROM that
      contains the Win/Mac drivers. This state should be detected by the
      u3g driver and the usb device is sent a command to switch to modem
      mode. This has been working for quite some time but as it is
      implemented differently for each vendor I am looking for feedback
      on any units where the auto switchover is not working (or the init
      is not recognized at all). Please ensure you are running an up to
      date kernel, like r201681 or later from 9.0-CURRENT, or 8-STABLE
      after the future merge of this revision.</p>

      <p>Since the last report we have seen a growth of 2,000 users on our
      forums resulting in approximately 10,000 registered users at this time. The
      posts count is about to reach 60,000 soon, which are contained in
      almost 9,000 threads.</p>

      <p>The sign-up rate still hovers between 50-100 each week. The
      total number of visitors (including 'guests') is currently hard to
      gauge, but is likely to be a substantial multiple of the registered
      userbase.</p>

      <p>New topics and posts are actively 'pushed out' to search
      engines. This in turn makes the forums show up in search results
      more and more often, making it a valuable and very accessible
      source of information for the &os; community.</p>

      <p>One of the contributing factors to the forums' success is their
      'BSD-style' approach when it comes to administration and
      moderation. The forums have a strong and unified identity and are
      very actively moderated, spam-free, and with a core group of very
      active and helpful members, dispensing many combined decades' worth
      of knowledge to starting, intermediate and professional users of

      <p>V4L video support in the Linux emulator is now available.</p>

      <p>This work allows Linux applications using V4L video calls to
      work with existing &os; video drivers that provide V4L interfaces.
      It is tested and working with the net/skype port and also with
      browser-based Flash applications that access webcams. An early version has been
      committed to 9.0-CURRENT and work is in progress to commit the latest
      version and then MFC. It is also tested on &os;-8.0/amd64 and
      &os;-7.2/i386.</p>

      <p>Note: to be clear, this does not add V4L support to all webcams.
      The &os; camera driver must already offer V4L support itself in
      order for a Linux application to be able to use that camera. The
      multimedia/pwcbsd port provides the pwc(4) driver that already has
      V4L support. If your camera is supported by a different driver, you
      will need to enhance that driver to add V4L support.</p>

      <p>Historically, &os; has limited the number of supplemental
	groups per process to 15 (NGROUPS_MAX was incorrectly declared to be
	16).  In &os; 8.0-RELEASE we raised the limit to 1023, which should be
	sufficient for most users and will be acceptably efficient for
	incorrectly written applications that statically allocate
	NGROUPS_MAX + 1 entries.</p>

      <p>Because some systems such as Linux 2.6 support a larger
	group limit, we have further relaxed this restriction in 9.0-CURRENT and
	made kern.ngroups a tunable value, which supports values between 1023
	and INT_MAX - 1.  We plan to merge this to 8-STABLE before
	8.1-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>The base/projects/mips branch has been merged into 9.0-CURRENT.
      The merge is complete and the sanity tests have passed. The code
      has booted on both a Ubiquiti RouterStation (big endian) as well as
      in gxemul (little endian).</p>

      <p>The branch lived for one year, minus a day, and accumulated much
      work:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A new port to the Atheros AR71xx series of processors. This
        port supports the RouterStation and RouterStation PRO boards from
        Ubiquiti. Other boards should work with minimal tweaking. This
        port should be considered as nearing production quality, and has
        been used extensively by the developers. The primary author of
        this port is Oleksandr Tymoshenko (gonzo@FreeBSD.org).</li>

        <li>A new port to the SiByte BCM1250 SoC on the BCM91250
        evaluation board (aka SWARM). This port is reported to be stable,
        but this hardware is a little old and not widely available. The
        primary author of this port is Neel Natu (neel@FreeBSD.org). Only
        one core is presently supported.</li>

        <li>A port, donated by Cavium, to their Octeon and Octeon plus
        series of SoC (CN3xxx and CN5xxx). This code is preliminary,
        supporting only a single core right now. It has been lightly
        tested on the CN3860 evaluation board only in 32-bit mode. Warner
        Losh (imp@FreeBSD.org) has been driving the efforts to get this
        code into the tree.</li>

        <li>A port, donated by RMI, to their XLR series of SoCs. This
        port is single core only, as well. The code reaches multi-user but
        should be considered beta quality for the moment. Randal Stewart
        (rrs@FreeBSD.org) has been driving the efforts to integrate this
        into the tree.</li>

        <li>Preliminary support for building a mips64 kernel from this
        source base. More work is needed here, but at least two kernels
        successfully build in 64-bit mode (OCTEON1 and MALTA64).</li>

        <li>Very early support for N32 and N64 ABIs</li>

        <li>Support for booting compressed kernels has been added
        (gonzo@).</li>

        <li>Improved support for debugging</li>

        <li>Improved busdma and bus_space support</li>

        <li>Many bug fixes</li>

        <li>More types of MIPS cores are recognized</li>

        <li>Expanded cache handling for newer processors</li>

        <li>Beginning of a port to the alchemy au1XXX cpus is present,
        but experimental.</li>

        <li>Work on SMP is underway to support multicore processors like
        the SiByte, Octeon and XLR processors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The development branch had been updated incorrectly several times over the
	past year, and the damage was too much to repair. We have retired the
      branch and will do further mips development in 9.0-CURRENT for the time
      being. If you have a checked out tree, the suggested way to update
      the projects/mips tree you have is to do a "svn switch
      svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/head" in that tree.</p>

      <p>I would like to thank everybody that has contributed time, code
      or hardware to make &os;/mips better.</p>

      <p>As development proceeds, I will keep posting updates. In
      addition, I hope to have some mini "how-to" wiki pages done for
      people that want to try it out.</p>

      <p>Bugmeister Gavin Atkinson has now been granted a src commit
	bit, and is now starting to work through some of our
	backlog.</p>

      <p>The list of PRs recommended for committer evaluation by the
	Bugbusting Team continues to receive new additions; however, it
	has not yet achieved high visibility.  (This list contains PRs,
	mostly with patches, that the Bugbusting Team consider potentially
	ready to be committed as-is, or are probably trivially resolved
	in the hands of a committer with knowledge of the particular
	subsystem.)  One of the suggestions at the Cambridge devsummit
	was to create a way for people to be emailed the weekly summary
	that is posted to freebsd-bugs@, and this has now been implemented.
	Please email linimon@FreeBSD.org to ask to be added to the
	recommended_subscribers.txt file (see above).</p>

      <p>We continue to classify PRs as they arrive, adding 'tags' to the
	subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved, or
	man page references for userland PRs.  These tags, in turn, produce
	lists of PRs sorted both by tag and by manpage.  At this point
	most of the PRs that refer to supported versions of &os; have
	been converted, and we are keeping up as new ones come in.  We
	hope that this is making it easier to browse the PR database.</p>
      
      <p>The overall PR count jumped to over 6,200 during the 8.0-RELEASE release
	cycle but seems to have stabilized at around 6,100.  As in the
	past, we have a fairly good clearance rate for ports PRs but
	much less so for other PRs.  (Partly this is due to the concept
	of individual ports having 'maintainers'.)</p>

      <p>bwn(4) is replacing bwi(4) driver for to the following
	reasons:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Uses latest v4 firmware image instead of using the much older v3
	  firmware. In this way, we have some great benefits, such as
	  support for N-PHYs and the fixes of various earlier firmware bugs.</li>

	<li>Supports PIO mode. This is important because &mdash; as you might
	  know &mdash; the Broadcom Wireless Driver is created by
	  reverse-engineering so some pieces of hardware might not
	  work with DMA operations.</li>

	<li>Supports 64 bit DMA operations.</li>

	<li>Separates bwi(4) driver into two parts; siba(4) driver and
	  bwn(4) driver.  Many Broadcom wireless and NIC devices
	  are based on Silicon Sonics Backplane, such as bwi(4), which
	  implemented the SIBA operations internally. This resulted in
	  code duplication as other drivers had to implement their
	  own routines to deal with SIBA.  In the case of bwn(4),
	  these two parts have been separated and implemented in their
	  own kernel modules to avoid this problem and help further
	  development by providing a standalone siba(4) driver.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Currently, it is tested on big/little endian machines and 32/64-bit
	DMA operation with STA mode.  A major patch for siba(4)
	is being reviewed before committing into 9.0-CURRENT.</p>

	<li>A separate port for guest additions for &os; guests has
	  been created &mdash; virtualbox-ose-additions.</li>

	<li>Proper &os; support for PulseAudio has been added.</li>

	<li>Procfs is not required anymore because vbox uses sysctl(3)
	  now.</li>

	<li>Juergen Lock's &os; host networking patches have been added.  They
	  are now also in the upstream vbox SVN (modulo vbox variable

	<li>Allow direct tap networking again (for users that need the
	  best network performance and/or need more complex network
	  setups, like when they want to use routing instead of bridging
	  to e.g. protect guests from messing with the lan's ARP tables;
	  a tap + routing + proxy arp example is in the above

      <p>Since the last report, a lot has happened mostly in the area of

	them are missing builtins and libstdc++ is broken for other

      <p>Not much happened in the clangbsd branch as we cannot
	upgrade the clang/llvm there because we are blocked by a bug
	that requires using newer assembler than we can ship.  This

      <p>Preliminary Hardware Performance Counter support for Intel
	XScale ARM processors was committed to &os; 9.0-CURRENT
	in December.  This adds another supported architecture to hwpmc(9).
	The system works for basic performance counter usage but more
	advanced usage scenarios, namely callchain support, are not
	yet implemented.</p>

Compiling status reports - best practices

1) Call for reports
  - Are usually sent to freebsd-hackers@ CC freebsd-current@ as the lists
    with the most usual suspects for submitting reports.  Forward to
    developers@ as well.  Also ping individuals which are known to have
    something cooking.
  - The xml-template is at:
    http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-sample.xml and the generator
    CGI at: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/monthly.cgi at the time of this
    writing.  Make sure to keep them up to date with regard to categories
    to pick from and place them prominently in the CFR - otherwise people
    submit plain text reports and you have to format them yourself.
  - Reporting howto is at: http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/howto.html.
    It contains a great deal of useful hints for the submitters on how
    to write good reports.  But it also helps to forward all the completed
    reports to developers for reference, and point to the latest report
    in the CFR.

2) In the past we usually had to extend the deadline by a week in order to
   get everybody to report.  Starting early with kind reminders seems to
   help ;)  Ideally, reminders should be sent at least one month before the
   deadline.  But it is worthwhile the keep sending reminders two weeks
   before the deadline and on the day of the deadline.

3) The following groups should be definitely approached for a report on
   their recent activities:
   - core@, portmgr@, doceng@, secteam@, re@, postmaster@, clusteradm@,
     devsummit@ (team reports).
   - FreeBSD Foundation (emaste@), participants of Foundation-sponsored
     projects, deb@ (Deb Goodkin) can also do a report for the Foundation
     itself.
   - Various conference organizers, depending on the season:
     - BSDCan (info@bsdcan.org) May (April-June)
     - EuroBSDcon (foundation@eurobsdcon.org) Sept-Oct (October-December)
     - AsiaBSDCon (secretary@asiabsdcon.org) March (January-March)
   - Google Summer of Code students and their mentors (soc-students@ and
     soc-mentors@, April-June, July-September).
   - All submitters for the previous quarterly status report (they may have
     updates or further improvements).

   Our readers seem to value these reports, so we should try to get them in
   if at all possible.

4) Building the report:
  - Fold the reports into a work-in-progress draft as they are coming in (see
    point 5) for putting the report together). Commit the result and hook the
    draft into the build, so you can (almost) immediately provide the
    submitters a preview of their entries.  This is also a good excuse to do
    a acknowledgement on the receipt.
  - While the report draft is kept updated, other doc-committers (wblock,
    pluknet, and bjk, for example) may review the individual entries and
    propose fixes.
  - As mentioned above, the received reports should be in a single .xml file,
    where tidy(1) may be used to get them well-formatted.  Usually <url>s
    without a description are missing the closing "/>" which is the cause for
    most of the errors you will encounter.  Sometimes other closing tags are
    missing.
  - Invoking tidy with the following options seems to cause the fewest
    problems: tidy -xml -i -wrap 74 -latin1 -preserve
  - Some special characters still break with that - noticed when sos@
    submits a report.
  - Remove empty "<help></help>" sections, they cause a strange looking
    newline.
  - The <body> part usually needs a hand to make it proper html.  Use <a
    href=""> here, not <url>.
  - Lists come out best if you close the <p> before and start a new one
    after, like:
      ... blabla:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>some item</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some more blabla ...

5) Wrapping the whole thing in a report template:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
<!DOCTYPE report PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//DTD FreeBSD XML Database for Status
Report//EN"
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/XML/share/xml/statusreport.dtd">
<!-- $FreeBSD$ -->
<report>
  <date>
    <month>July-September</month>

    <year>2006</year>
  </date>

 - Categories are subject to change obviously.  They come out in the order
   as stated in the report.  After another round of tidy(1) try to balance
   the categories.  Put things where they belong best, retire categories
   that don't fill up, etc.  Adding it to your local build and looking at
   the html helps.  Make sure you have an up-to-date doc tree.

 - theraven may be poked for composing a nice introduction for the reports.
   But should be usually the last step in the process; a good introduction
   can be only written once the report is considered finished.

6) Sending it out:
  - After a few days, collate and commit the changes.  Also update the
    next due date in status.xml and link to the new report.
  - Add a news entry to head/share/xml/news.xml.  Template:
	 <event>
	   <title>June-October 2006 Status Report</title>

	  <p>The <a
		href="&enbase;/news/status/report-2006-06-2006-10.html">June to October 2006 Status Report</a>
	     is now available with 49 entries.</p>
        </event>
  - Extract a text version with the command
    lynx -dump -nolist report.html > report.txt and prettify it.
  - Send out To: hackers, CC: current, stable, BCC: developers.  New email
    to: announce@.  This last one needs to be approved, so find someone
    (mail postmaster) who can do that before you start.

7) Repeat.

Compiling status reports - best practices

0) Timeline (relative to submission deadline)

-1 month  First call for reports
-2 weeks  Reminder
-1 week   Reminder, and follow up with teams and individuals we expect to
          submit reports
deadline  Follow up on missing reports
          Continue editing individual reports
          Continue adding new (late) reports as they arrive
+1 week   Edit overall report and write introduction
+10 days  Publish report

1) Call for reports
  - Are usually sent to freebsd-hackers@ CC freebsd-current@ as the lists
    with the most usual suspects for submitting reports.  Forward to
    developers@ as well.  Also ping individuals which are known to have
    something cooking.
  - The xml-template is at:
    http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-sample.xml and the generator
    CGI at: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/monthly.cgi at the time of this
    writing.  Make sure to keep them up to date with regard to categories
    to pick from and place them prominently in the CFR - otherwise people
    submit plain text reports and you have to format them yourself.
  - Reporting howto is at: http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/howto.html.
    It contains a great deal of useful hints for the submitters on how
    to write good reports.  But it also helps to forward all the completed
    reports to developers for reference, and point to the latest report
    in the CFR.
  - It may also be worth making a call for reports on the forums as was
    done here:
    https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/call-for-freebsd-2014q4-october-december-status-reports.49812/

2) In the past we usually had to extend the deadline by a week in order to
   get everybody to report.  Starting early with kind reminders seems to
   help ;)  Ideally, reminders should be sent at least one month before the
   deadline.  But it is worthwhile the keep sending reminders two weeks
   before the deadline and on the day of the deadline.

3) The following groups should be definitely approached for a report on
   their recent activities:
   - core@, portmgr@, doceng@, secteam@, re@, postmaster@, clusteradm@,
     devsummit@ (team reports).
   - FreeBSD Foundation (emaste@), participants of Foundation-sponsored
     projects, deb@ (Deb Goodkin) can also do a report for the Foundation
     itself.
   - Various conference organizers, depending on the season:
     - BSDCan (info@bsdcan.org) May (April-June)
     - EuroBSDcon (foundation@eurobsdcon.org) Sept-Oct (October-December)
     - AsiaBSDCon (secretary@asiabsdcon.org) March (January-March)
   - Google Summer of Code students and their mentors (soc-students@ and
     soc-mentors@, April-June, July-September).
   - All submitters for the previous quarterly status report (they may have
     updates or further improvements).

   Our readers seem to value these reports, so we should try to get them in
   if at all possible.

4) Building the report:
  - Fold the reports into a work-in-progress draft as they are coming in (see
    point 5) for putting the report together). Commit the result and hook the
    draft into the build, so you can (almost) immediately provide the
    submitters a preview of their entries.  This is also a good excuse to do
    a acknowledgement on the receipt.
  - While the report draft is kept updated, other doc-committers (wblock,
    pluknet, and bjk, for example) may review the individual entries and
    propose fixes.
  - As mentioned above, the received reports should be in a single .xml file,
    where tidy(1) may be used to get them well-formatted.  Usually <url>s
    without a description are missing the closing "/>" which is the cause for
    most of the errors you will encounter.  Sometimes other closing tags are
    missing.
  - Invoking tidy with the following options seems to cause the fewest
    problems: tidy -xml -i -wrap 74 -latin1 -preserve
  - Some special characters still break with that - noticed when sos@
    submits a report.
  - Remove empty "<help></help>" sections, they cause a strange looking
    newline.
  - The <body> part usually needs a hand to make it proper html.  Use <a
    href=""> here, not <url>.
  - Lists come out best if you close the <p> before and start a new one
    after, like:
      ... blabla:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>some item</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some more blabla ...

5) Wrapping the whole thing in a report template:

  - Use a filename of yyyy-mm-yyyy-mm.xml for the new report, where the
    first mm is the starting month and the second mm is the ending
    month.

  - Create the new report by copying report-template.xml and replacing
    the variables in it with actual values.  Or 'svn cp' a previous
    report and make sure the new file has the svn:mime-type set to
    text/xml with 'svn propget svn:mime-type'.

  - Add the new file to the XMLDOCS entries in the Makefile.

  - Sample contents:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
<!DOCTYPE report PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//DTD FreeBSD XML Database for Status
Report//EN"
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/XML/share/xml/statusreport.dtd">
<!-- $FreeBSD$ -->
<report>

 - Categories are subject to change obviously.  They come out in the order
   as stated in the report.  After another round of tidy(1) try to balance
   the categories.  Put things where they belong best, retire categories
   that do not fill up, etc.  Adding it to your local build and looking at
   the html helps.  Make sure you have an up-to-date doc tree.

 - theraven may be poked for composing a nice introduction for the reports.
   But should be usually the last step in the process; a good introduction
   can be only written once the report is considered finished.

 - wblock suggests that we ask different people to write introductions to
   add variety.  Different people will bring different viewpoints and help
   keep it fresh.

6) Committing it:

  - Files to edit and commit:

    In doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/htdocs/news/status/ :
      The quarterly report itself:
        report-yyyy-mm-yyyy-mm.xml

      Update the next due date on the status report page and
      add a link to the new report below that:
        status.xml

    In doc/share/xml/ :
      The news entry for the main website page:
        news.xml

      Sample:
	<event>
	  <title>June-October 2006 Status Report</title>

	  <p>The <a
              href="&enbase;/news/status/report-2006-06-2006-10.html">June to October 2006 Status Report</a>
	    is now available with 49 entries.</p>
        </event>

  - Extract a text version with the command

    /usr/local/bin/lynx -dump -nolist ./report-yyyy-mm-yyyy-mm.html \
      | /usr/bin/iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 \
      | sed -e 's%Napieral/a%Napierała%g' > report.txt

    and prettify it.

    lynx defaults to a width of 80 and will forcibly wrap URLs to fit
    within that size.  The prettification process includes undoing that
    wrapping of URLS, and also fixing any cases where the name and email
    for a contact person have been placed onto different lines.  In some
    cases lynx will refuse to output certain Unicode characters (such
    as the U+0142 LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH STROKE found in trasz's
    surname), instead using an ASCII transliteration; these should be
    returned to the UTF-8 form.

    For the Links sections, put the title on one line, and the URL: on
    the following line, indented by an additional space than the title.

    Change the "Introduction" heading to read "FreeBSD Project Quarterly
    Status Report - <Nth> Quarter <year>"

  - Send out
    To: announce@

    This one must be approved, so find someone (mail postmaster) who can do
    that before starting.

    Send a separate mail:

    To: hackers
    CC: current, stable
    BCC: developers

7) Repeat.

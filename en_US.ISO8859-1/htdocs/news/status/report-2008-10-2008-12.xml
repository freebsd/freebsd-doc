    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This quarter included some very exciting work including the
    release of FreeBSD 6.4 and the much anticipated release of
    FreeBSD 7.1. We also launched our own official <a
    href="http://forums.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD Forums</a>.
    The first Bugathon of the year will be held this weekend, see
    below for more information and how to participate.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you
    enjoy reading.</p>

      has been setup on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
      explicitly for BSD conference recordings. This channel does not
      have the normal 10 minute limit so full high quality presentations
      from 30 minutes to nearly 2 hours have been uploaded. So far over
      23 videos are available from MeetBSD and NYCBSDCon, with more from
      BSDCan and AsiaBSDCon coming soon.</p>

      subtitles for each video in various languages. If you would like to

      <p>Some bugs have been fixed in the buffering and binary file
      detection parts of grep. Due to the differences between the GNU
      regexp library and our libc regexp implementation, I switched to the
      GNU library so that we can maintain an acceptable level of
      compatibility. The desired option would be to drop both GNU grep
      and the GNU regexp library, but unfortunately we cannot just do that
      because of these incompatibilities. Accordingly, the first step
      should be replacing grep and then we should review and optimize our
      regexp library. With this decision, BSD grep has acquired a higher
      level of compatibility and now seems to be much more useful.</p>

      <p>Last year, we didn't have many Bugathons - this year is planned
      to be different!</p>

      <p>The BugBusting team is trying to improve bug handling and thus
      we'll start a new experiment. In the past our Bugathons were
      general Bugathons with no special topic set. Instead, starting in
      2009 we'll try to hold a series of Bugathons that concentrate on
      special interest areas.</p>

      <p>Our next Bugathon will be held from 2009-01-30 to 2009-02-01
      (Fri-Sun). We'll try to handle as many network related bugs as we
      can. Our plan is to try to work through all network related PRs
      still open in GNATS.</p>

      <p>We need a number of maintainers in the area of networking
      (drivers, chipsets, protocols, userland processes) to attend and
      committers willing to commit fixes and improvements. Of course, we
      also need users and administrators with special interest in network
      related items to be with us to sort out things. Every helping hand,
      everyone able to debug and analyze things is welcome.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in getting networking stuff improved, join
      us to make the upcoming releases of 7.2 and 8.0 the best ever
      FreeBSD releases.</p>

      <p>Join us on IRC: EFnet #FreeBSD-bugbusters from Friday 2009-01-30
      to Sunday 2009-02-01. Don't miss this event!</p>

      <p>The next Bugathon (TBA) will have topics in different special
      interest areas.</p>

      <p>We will be having our next Bugathon on 2009-01-30 to 2009-02-01
      (see <a href="#FreeBSD-Bugathons">this</a> entry).</p>

      <p>At the recent DevSummit in Strasbourg, the participants spent
      half a day working through the current "recommended PRs" list. The
      list was divided up into sections by date, and each table was
      assigned one section to work through. Not only were a good number
      of fixes committed and their PRs closed, but the src developers
      were brought up to speed on the triage work that the BugBusting
      team has been doing (see below). We hope to build on this momentum
      in the future. In addition, many new ideas for improved report
      pages were discussed.</p>

      <p>We continue to make good progress in categorizing PRs as they
      arrive with 'tags' that correspond to manpages. As a result, we now
      have created some prototype reports that allow browsing the
      database 
      <a
      href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/pr_manpage_index.html">
      by manpage</a>.</p>

      <p>In addition, another new report, oriented towards PR submitters,
      summarizes the 
      <a
      href="http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/well_known_prs.html">
      most commonly reported issues</a>. Many of these issues persist
      because they are difficult to fix. Before filing a PR, you may
      want to check through this list.</p>

      <p>As well, we now have a more active set of volunteers who are
      willing to help users with reported problems of the form "xyz does
      not seem to work". These types of reports are now being handled
      much better than in the past.</p>

      <p>One of those volunteers, Bruce Cran (brucec@), has now been
      released from mentorship.</p>

      <p>Mark Linimon (linimon@) continues to work on more new prototype
      reports, including:</p>

      commonly reported issues</a> summary page, previously maintained
      by Jeremy Chadwick, has been moved to a new location.</p>

      <p>The overall PR count jumped to over 5600 during the 6.4/7.1
      release cycle, but has come down a bit.</p>

      <p>The multi-IPv4/v6/no-IP jails project patch has finally been
      committed to FreeBSD-CURRENT at the end of November.</p>

      <p>As an alternate solution to full network stack virtualization,
      this work shall provide a lightweight solution for multi-IP
      virtualization. The changes are even more important because of the
      emerging demand for IPv6. Ideally this will be merged to FreeBSD 7
      before 7.2-RELEASE and stay in FreeBSD 8 for the transitional
      period to full network stack virtualization.</p>

      <p>Since the commit a few minor things have been fixed and work to
      address most of the remaining old jails PRs has almost been
      finished. The fallout from ports breakage has been handled with
      help from Erwin Lansing from the PortMgr Team.</p>

      <p>Because of a lack of time, Mono stalled at version 1.2.5 for
      more than one year in the FreeBSD ports tree. However, things have
      moved and the BSD# Team is proud to announce that the Mono ports are
      about to be updated to 2.0.1. Ports depending on Mono will also be

      <p>Most of the effort in the last quarter has been QA effort for
      6.4-RELEASE and 7.1-RELEASE. Since that time, we have once again
      begun work on experimental package runs.</p>

      <p>The ports count has jumped to over 19,600. The PR count had
      jumped during the freeze/slush cycle for release, but has now
      dropped back to its usual count of around 900.</p>

      <p>GNOME has been updated to 2.24.3.</p>

      <p>KDE has been updated to 4.1.4.</p>

      <p>X.Org has been updated to 7.4.</p>

      <p>The following large changes are in the pipeline:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Introduction of Perl 5.10.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We are currently building packages for amd64-6, amd64-7,
      amd64-8, i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, sparc64-6, and sparc64-7. Several
      new i386 and sparc64 machines have been added, which has helped
      speed up the builds. We especially appreciate the loan of a number
      of sparc64 machines by Gavin Atkinson.</p>

      <p>We have added 5 new committers since the last report, and 2
      older ones have rejoined.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR
      assigned to committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is
      helping to keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more
      to get the ports in the shape they really need to be in.</task>

      <task>Although we have added many maintainers, we still have over
      4,700 unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list on portsmon).
      (The percentage hovers around 24%.) We are always looking for
      dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few unmaintained ports. As
      well, the packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag behind i386, and we
      need more testers for those.</task>

      <p>This work is bringing support for another Book-E style PowerPC
      implementation (PPC440/460 core) embedded in a wide range of
      system-on-chip devices. Current state highlights:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Locore kernel initialisation</li>

        <li>TLB handling</li>

        <li>Console (UART)</li>

        <li>USB controller (OHCI, EHCI)</li>

        <li>Multi user operation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The CPU layer (kernel start-up, TLB handling) is derived from
      existing E500 support. Eventually the code will be re-factored so
      that the common logic is shared between processor variations and
      only the lowest-level routines are provided separately. A number of
      drivers for peripherals integrated on the chip needs to be written
      (Ethernet, PCI/PCI-Express, crypto engines, SATA, I2C, SPI, GPIO
      and others).</p>

        <p>Since the last status report both 7.1-RELEASE (5 January 2009)
	and 6.4-RELEASE (28 November 2008) have been released. Starting
	with 6.4-RELEASE, a new DVD ISO image called "dvd1" is provided
	for amd64/i386. This image contains everything that is on the
	CDROM discs. So "dvd1" can be used to do a full installation that
        includes a basic set of packages, it has all of the documentation
        for all supported languages, and it can be used for booting into
        a "live CD-based filesystem" and system rescue mode. 6.4-RELEASE
        was the last release of the 6.X branch, we have currently no plan
        for any other 6.X release since most of the developers are
        focused on 8-CURRENT and 7.X.</p>

        <p>The long awaited 7.1-RELEASE is out since 5th of January. This
        release process was far too long from everyone's point of view.
        Working on another release (6.4-RELEASE) at the same time was not
        helping the things, but we are aware of many problems that need
        to be worked on to ease the whole release process. As a
        consequence, we are currently working on a new plan for future
        7.X (or 8.0) release. We plan to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduce the freeze period of ports tree, the freeze should
          occur near the end of the release process during RC cycle</li>

          <li>Change the way showstoppers are handled and do not stop a
          release process for non-important issues or lack of
          features.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some work has also been done on the documentation build, we
        want to provide a more flexible way to install docs (Handbook,
        FAQ, etc.) and detach the documentation build from the release build to use
        instead ports (packages). This should make release building
        easier on slow architectures. Hopefully this switch will be done
        for 7.2-RELEASE or 8.0-RELEASE.</p>

        <p>Regarding the time line, we still plan to release 8.0-RELEASE
        in mid-June 2009. A time for the 7.2-RELEASE has not been set
	yet.</p>

        <p>snd_hda(4) audio driver was significantly improved to provide
        better functionality according to High Definition Audio (HDA) and
        Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) specifications.</p>

        <p>According to HDA specification, driver now supports multiple
        codecs per HDA bus and multiple audio functional groups per
        codec.</p>

        <p>According to UAA specification, driver now implements idea of
        multiple logical audio devices per audio functional group. It
        means, that depending on specific system needs, single audio
        codec may provide several independent functions. For example,
        main multichannel output, headset input/output and digital
        SPDIF/HDMI audio input/output. Each of these functions are
	provided as separate pcm devices and can be used independently.</p>

        <p>Comparing to ALSA and OSS HDA drivers which are heavily tuned
        to support each specific codec in every specific system, this
        driver uses advanced codec tracing logic which allows it to
        support most of existing HDA codecs and systems without any
        special tuning, using only information provided by system and
        codec itself. This also allows user to widely reconfigure logical
        audio devices in his system for his own needs, just by specifying
        wanted audio connectors usage in device.hints.</p>

    <body>
      <p>FreeBSD 8.0-CURRENT now has basic support for sun4u-machines
      based on UltraSPARC III and beyond. This is still a work in
      progress though due to the diversity of these machines, hardware
      errata and bugs in machine independent parts of FreeBSD showing up.
      A install image with the latest code which in comparison to the
      official snapshot 200812 contains more dcons(4) fixes, an isp(4)
      working with 10160 and 12160 on sparc64, an endian-clean mpt(4) as
      needed for the on-board controller found in Fire V440, workarounds
      needed for Fire V880 and a fix for machines with more than 8GB of
      RAM (tested with 16GB) are available at the above URL. Known working
      machines so far are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blade 1000</li>
        <li>Blade 1500</li>
        <li>Blade 2000</li>
        <li>Fire 280R</li>
        <li>Fire V210</li>
        <li>Fire V440 (except for the on-board NICs)</li>
        <li>Fire V880</li>
        <li>Netra 20/Netra T4</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The stability of FreeBSD on these machines is en par with that
      on pre-USIII-based sun4u-machines. Machines similar to the ones
      above like for example Fire V240 should also just work with all
      essential on-board devices, i.e. serial console, ATA/SCSI
      controller and NIC, being supported. So far the intention is to MFC
      this code in time for FreeBSD 7.2.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Apart from serial devices, only cards supported by creator(4)
      are currently usable as console, i.e. not even machfb(4) works in
      sun4u-machines based on UltraSPARC III or beyond at this point (it
      will trigger a RED state exception, which should not be that hard
      to fix though), let alone XVR graphics cards.</task>

      <task>A driver for the Sun Cassini/Cassini+ as well as National
      Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit NICs found on-board for
      example in Fire V440 and as add-on cards is under development but
      still needs some work.</task>

      <task>There is no driver for controlling the fans in machines based
      on the Excalibur board, yet. This means that Blade 1000/2000 are
      not very usable as workstations so far due to the noise caused by
      the fans permanently running at full speed.</task>

      <task>There is no support for host-to-PCI-Express or host-to-PCI-X
      bridges so far, at least for the latter due to lack of access to
      such machines. Adding support for the XMITS PCI-X bridges to the
      existing schizo(4) should be rather straightforward, PCI-Express
      will require a new driver and probably some additional tweaking
      though.</task>

      <p>The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the
      FreeBSD kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of
      networking state. This allows for networking independence between
      jail-like environments, each maintaining its own private network
      interfaces, IPv4 and IPv6 network and port address space, routing
      tables, IPSec configuration, firewalls, and more.</p>

      <p>During BSDCan 2007 an initial commit plan had been worked out.
      The Developer Summit at Cambridge in August brought the first parts
      of VImage into the kernel. Marko gave a summary and outlook at
      EuroBSDCon in Strasbourg. From autumn until December all but the
      last step had been committed by Marko.</p>

      <p>Druing December Bjoern was able to work full time on VImage
      because of FreeBSD Foundation funding. In addition to helping with
      reviews, summarizing things on the Wiki, a virtual cross-over
      Ethernet-like interface pair was developed to be able to bring
      networking to an instances without the mandatory need of
      netgraph.</p>

      <p>The next steps will be to bring in the most important last step
      giving us multiple network stacks. After that all developers will
      be able to help to find (and fix) bugs. Further subsystems not yet
      addressed will need to be virtualized then. In addition to this
      Jamie Gritton's management interface will be imported.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>In this Quarter work has been progressing in quite a few areas of
    FreeBSD. FreeBSD 7.1-BETA2 and 6.4-RC2 have been released for
    pre-release testing. EuroBSDCon 2008 took place in Strasbourg, France
    and quite a few developers got together for the Developer Summit
    before the Conference. The USB2 stack has been imported into the
    -HEAD branch.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you
    enjoy reading.</p>

      <p>
      <em>ASUS Eee</em>

      is a line of cheap subnotebooks. These come with Linux or Windows
      preinstalled. The hardware is a bit inconventional, so it required
      some efforts to make FreeBSD run properly on this hardware. Also,
      these machines contain some hardware that was not supported by
      FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Currently FreeBSD should run on all Eee models out of the box,
      and most hardware should just work. At least, 700, 701, 901 and
      1000 was tested successfully. The hardware supported includes
      Atheros wireless backed by ath(4) in HEAD (you still need a patch
      for RELENG_7), Attansic L2 FastEthernet controller (ae(4)),
      High Definition audio controller (snd_hda), Synaptics touchpad and
      so on. Suspend/resume also works fine with some exceptions.</p>

      <p>There is also a hardware monitoring module, that allows user to
      control FAN speed and voltage, as well as monitor current CPU
      temperature. Wiki page contains information on how to obtain this
      module and use it. There are also a lot of useful tips and tricks
      for using FreeBSD on ASUS EeePC on that page.</p>

      <p>The implementation of cvsmode for csup has become more mature,
      and has been tested by a few people so far. All parts directly
      related to CVSMode have been implemented, and it seems to work
      quite well. Testers are still needed, so any users of cvsup
      using it to mirror or fetch the CVS repository (cvsmode/mirror
      mode) are encouraged to try it.</p>

      presentation</a>

      (in Hungarian) about the FreeBSD Hungarian Documentation Project in
      Debrecen, Hungary.</p>

      <p>Based on the checkupdate script mentioned in our previous status
      report, we launched our 
      <a
      href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-doc/2008-July/018608.html">
      Translation Checking Service</a>

      to help to schedule periodic updates for Hungarian doc/www

      automatic generation of the Handbook PDF version 
      <a
      href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-doc/2008-August/018785.html">
      was corrected</a>

      <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/hu/books/handbook">
      download</a>

      .</p>

      <p>Shortly after the renovation of its source, translation of the
      FAQ has also become part of Hungarian documentations. Both 
      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/hu/books/faq">online</a>

      and

      versions are available. A recently translated article
      (<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/hu/articles/gjournal-desktop">
      gjournal-desktop</a>) has also been added.</p>

      <p>Hungarian translation of the

      sponsor NYCBSDCon and EuroBSDCon. We are also a sponsor of
      MeetBSDCon. We provided travel grants for the Cambridge FreeBSD

      <p>There are many FreeBSD mirrors, either FTP or WWW or CVSup or
      RSync, but are they really all up-to-date? Some are, some aren't.
      The ones who aren't, how out to date are they? Or do they only
      carry a subset of the data? And how does it go over time?</p>

      <p>This project checks once per day the contents of the sites which
      are advertised in DNS, with the rsync*, www*, cvsup* and ftp*
      prefixes. The lists of hosts are based on the contents of the DNS
      zonefile for the country domains, so it will be automatically
      adjusted whenever a mirror is added.</p>

      <p>The statuses can be compared on country base and between two

      shortly, with 6.4-RELEASE expected about two weeks later. There are
      still a few issues being worked on for 7.1-RELEASE though hopefully
      we will be ready to proceed with 7.1-RC1 within the next week. Both
      6.4-RELEASE and 7.1-RELEASE will include DVD image ISOs for the
      amd64 and i386 architectures which has been requested by quite a
      few end-users.</p>

      <p>psm(4) provides basic support for Synaptics Touchpad but doesn't
      allow one to take advantage of many features like multi-finger tap
      and tap-hold, or virtual scrolling. A driver for X.Org is available
      but the movements are not very precise and the setup is not easy if
      you want to use your touchpad in the console.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to first provide a better movement
      filtering and smoothing, then bring the more advanced features.</p>

      <p>Right now, movement filtering, multi-finger tap, tap-hold and
      virtual scrolling (using a dedicated area) is implemented.</p>

      <p>Virtual scrolling with two fingers (as seen on Apple MacBook)
      will be brought back soon.</p>

      <p>But before that, the new driver needs testing! It's currently
      tested on an ASUS V6V only and feedback on other laptops would be
      greatly appreciated.</p>

      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project releases
	of &os;, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team completed the 10.3-RELEASE
	cycle late April, led by &a.marius;.  The release was one week
	behind the original schedule, to accommodate for a few last
	minute critical issues that were essential to include in the
	final release.</p>

      <p>The &os;&nbsp;11.0-RELEASE cycle started late May, one month
	behind the original schedule.  The schedule slip was primarily
	to accommodate for packaging the &os; base system with the
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> utility.  However, as work on this progressed,
	it became apparent that there were too many outstanding
	issues.  As a result, packaged base will be a "beta" feature
	for 11.0-RELEASE, with the goal of promoting it to a
	first-class feature in 11.1-RELEASE, with additional
	provisions to ensure a seamless transition for earlier
	supported releases.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact that packaged base is not going to be a
	prime feature for &os;&nbsp;11.0-RELEASE, the Release
	Engineering Team would like to thank everyone who tested,
	provided patches, provided ideas and feedback, and in some
	cases, shot themselves in the foot due to bugs.</p>

      <p>Ruby on Rails is the base for most of the rubygems in the
	Ports Collection.  Currently, versions 3.2 and 4.2 coexist.
	Since Rails 3.2 is running out of support, the time has
	come to switch to 4.2.</p>

      <p>While there is ongoing progress to remove Rails 3.2 from
	the ports tree, there are some major updates blocking this
	process.  The most recent blocker was the outstanding update
	of <tt>www/redmine</tt> from 2.6 to 3.2. This has completed
	successfully, so we can now move on.</p>

      <p>Now that the process-shared locks are implemented for our
	POSIX threads implementation library, <tt>libthr</tt>,
	the only major lacking feature for POSIX compliance is robust
	mutexes.  Robust mutexes allow the application to detect, and
	theoretically, recover from crashes which occur while
	modifying the shared state.  The supported model is to protect
	shared state by a <tt>pthread_mutex</tt>, and the crash is
	detected as the thread termination while owning the mutex.  A
	thread might terminate alone, or it could be killed due to the
	termination of the containing process.   As such, the robust
	attribute is applicable to both process-private and -shared
	mutexes.</p>

      <p>An application must be specifically modified to handle and
	recover from failures.  The <tt>pthread_mutex_lock()</tt>
	function may return new error <tt>EOWNERDEAD</tt>, which
	indicates that the previous owner of the lock terminated while
	still owning the lock.  Despite returning the non-zero value,
	the lock is granted to the caller.  In the simplest form, an
	application may detect the error and refuse to operate until
	the persistent shared data is recovered, such as by manual
	reinitialization.  More sophisticated applications could try
	to automatically recover from the condition, in which case
	<tt>pthread_mutex_consistent(3)</tt> must be called on the
	lock before the unlock.  However, such recovery can be
	considered to be very hard.  Still, even the detection of
	inconsistent shared state is useful, since it avoids further
	corruption and random faults of the affected application.
      </p>

      <p>It is curious but not unexpected that this interface is not
	used widely.  The only real-life application which utilizes it
	is Samba.  Using Samba with an updated FreeBSD base uncovered
	minor bugs both in the FreeBSD robustness implementation, and
	in Samba itself.</p>

      <p>It is believed that <tt>libthr</tt> in FreeBSD 11 is
	POSIX-compliant for large features.  Further work is planned
	to look at the lock structures inlining to remove overhead
	and improve performance of the library.</p>

      <p>Most of the implementation of the robustness feature
	consisted of making small changes in the lock and unlock
	paths, both in <tt>libthr</tt> and in <tt>kern_umtx.c</tt>.
	This literally required reading all of the code dealing with
	mutexes and conditional variables, which was something I
	wanted to help future developers with.  In the end, with the
	help of Ed Maste, the man pages for <tt>umtx(2)</tt> and all
	<tt>thr*(2)</tt> syscalls were written and added to the base
	system's documentation set.

    <title>EFI Refactoring, GELI Support</title>

      <url href="https://github.com/emc2/freebsd/tree/efize">EFI Refactoring Branch</url>
    </links>

    <body>
      <p>The EFI bootloader has undergone considerable refactoring to
	make more use of the EFI API.  The filesystem code in
	<tt>boot1</tt> has been eliminated, and a single codebase for
	filesystems now serves both <tt>boot1</tt> and
	<tt>loader</tt>.  This codebase is organized around the EFI
	driver model and it should be possible to export any
	filesystem implementation as a standalone EFI driver without
	too much effort.</p>

      <p>Both <tt>boot1</tt> and <tt>loader</tt> have been refactored
	to talk through the <tt>EFI_SIMPLE_FILE_SYSTEM</tt> interface.
	In <tt>loader</tt>, this is accomplished with a dummy
	filesystem driver that is just a translation layer between the
	<tt>loader</tt> filesystem interface and
	<tt>EFI_SIMPLE_FILE_SYSTEM</tt>.  A reverse translation layer
	allows the existing filesystem drivers to function as EFI
	drivers.</p>

      <p>The EFI refactoring by itself exists in
	<a href="https://github.com/emc2/freebsd/tree/efize">this branch</a>.</p>

      <p>Additionally, GELI support has been added using the EFI
	refactoring.  This allows booting from a GELI-encrypted
	filesystem.  Note that the EFI system partition, which
	contains <tt>boot1</tt>, must be a plaintext msdosfs
	partition.  This patch adds an intake buffer to the crypto
	framework, which allows injection of keys directly into a
	loaded kernel, without the need to pass them through
	arguments or environment variables.  This patch only uses the
	intake buffer for EFI GELI support as legacy BIOS GELI support
	still uses environment variables.</p>

      <p>EFI GELI support depends on the
	<a href="https://github.com/emc2/freebsd/tree/geli_efi">efize branch</a>.</p>

      <p>These patches have been tested and used and should be able
	to handle use by early adopters.  Note that the
	<tt>LOADER_PATH</tt> variable has been changed to
	<tt>/boot/loader.tst</tt>, to facilitate safe testing.</p>

      <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>

      <p>As this is an encrypted filesystem patch, an error can
	potentially leave data inaccessible.  It is
	<em>strongly</em> recommended to use the following procedure
	for testing:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>Back up your data!</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Do not forget to back up your data!</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Install an EFI shell on the ESP.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Install the patched <tt>boot1</tt> on the ESP to
	    something like <tt>/boot/efi/BOOTX64.TST</tt>.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Install the patched loader to <tt>/boot/loader.tst</tt>
	    on your machine.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Create a GELI partition outside of the normal boot
	    partition.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>First, try booting <tt>/boot/efi/BOOTX64.TST</tt> and
	    make sure it properly handles the encrypted partition.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Copy a boot environment, including the patched loader, to
	    the encrypted partition.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Use the loader prompt to load a kernel from the encrypted
	    partition.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Try switching over to an encrypted main partition once
	    everything else has worked.</p>

      <p>VIMAGE is a virtualization framework on top of FreeBSD jails
	that was introduced to the kernel about eight years ago with
	the <tt>vnet</tt> virtualized network stack.</p>

      <p>Over the last few years, many people started to use VIMAGE
	in production, production-like setups, and appliances.  This
	adoption increased the urgency to finish the work to avoid
	panics on network stack teardown and to avoid memory
	leaks.</p>

      <p>The <tt>vnet</tt> teardown has been changed to be from top to
	bottom, trying to tear down layer by layer.  This is
	preferable to removing interfaces first and then cleaning
	everything up, as no more packets could flow.  Along with this
	work, various parts with potential memory leaks were plugged.
	Lastly, <tt>vnet</tt> support was added to formerly
	unvirtualized components, such as the <tt>pf</tt> and
	<tt>ipfilter</tt> firewalls and some virtual interfaces.</p>

    <body>
      <p>Half a year ago, I started a promotion campaign to improve
	support for fetching ports via IPv6.  Research performed in
	December, 2015 showed that 10,308 of 25,522 ports are not
	fetchable when using IPv6-only as these ports ignore the <a
	  href="distcache.freebsd.org">FreeBSD.org pkg mirror</a>.</p>

      <p>As a result of the campaign, the following servers now
	successfully support IPv6:</p>

      <ol>
	<li><a href="mirror.amdmi3.ru">mirror.amdmi3.ru</a></li>

	<li><a href="vault.centos.org">vault.centos.org</a></li>

	<li><a href="people.freebsd.org">people.freebsd.org</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This enables 711 more ports to be fetched via IPv6.</p>

      <p>I would like to thank Wolfgang Zenker who is very active in
	supporting the adoption of IPv6.  During the latest RIPE
	meeting, he brought up the topic of non-support of IPv6
	being a hindrance to business.  I am hopeful that his talk
	changed some more minds and will help widen the support of
	IPv6.</p>

      <p>During BSDCan 2016, Microsoft <a
	  href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/freebsd-now-available-in-azure-marketplace/">announced</a>
	the global availability of FreeBSD 10.3 images in Azure.
	There are many FreeBSD-based Azure virtual appliances in the
	Azure Marketplace, including Citrix Systems' NetScaler and
	Netgate's pfSense.  Microsoft also made an in-depth technical
	presentation to introduce how the performance of the Hyper-V
	network device driver was optimized to reach full line rate on
	10Gb networks and achieved decent performance on 40Gb
	networks.  The slides and video from the presentation are
	available from the <a
	  href="http://www.bsdcan.org/2016/schedule/events/681.en.html">BSDCan website</a>.</p>

      <p>Microsoft continues to strive to further optimize the
	performance of Hyper-V network and storage device drivers.
	Work is ongoing to replace the internal data structure in the
	LRO kernel API from a singly-linked list to a double-linked
	list, to speed up the LRO lookup by hash table, and to compare
	the performance with <tt>tcp_lro_queue_mbuf()</tt>.</p>

      <p>The handling of SCSI inquiry in the Hyper-V storage driver is
	enhanced to make sure disk hotplug and <tt>smartctl(8)</tt>
	work reliably.  Refer to <a
	  href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=210425">PR 210425</a>

	<li>Object Storage: Ceph provides seamless access to objects
	  using native language bindings or <tt>radosgw</tt>, a REST
	  interface that is compatible with applications written for
	  S3 and Swift.</li>

	<li>Block Storage: Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides
	  access to block device images that are striped and
	  replicated across the entire storage cluster.</li>

	<li>File System: Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file
	  system that aims for high performance, large data storage,
	  and maximum compatibility with legacy applications.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I started looking into Ceph as using HAST with CARP and
	<tt>ggate</tt> did not meet my requirements.  My primary goal
	with Ceph is to run a storage cluster of ZFS storage nodes
	where the clients run bhyve on RBD disks stored in Ceph.</p>

      <p>The &os; build process can build most of the tools in
	Ceph.  However, the RBD-dependent items do not work since
	&os; does not yet provide RBD support.</p>

      <p>Since the last quarterly report, the following progress was
	made:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>The changeover from using CMake to Automake results in a
	  much cleaner development environment and better test output.
	  The changes can be found in the
	  <tt>wip-wjw-freebsd-cmake</tt> branch.</li>

	<li>Throttling code has been overhauled to prevent live locks.
	  These mainly occur on &os; but also manifest on Linux.</li>

	<li>Fixed a few more tests.  On one occasion, I was able to
	  complete the full test set without errors.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>11-CURRENT is used to compile and build test Ceph.  The
	Clang toolset needs to be at least version 3.7 as Clang 3.4
	does not have all of the capabilities required to compile
	everything.</p>

      <p>This setup will get things running for &os;:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>Install <tt>bash</tt> and link it in <tt>/bin</tt>
	    (requires root privileges):</p>

	  <p><tt>sudo pkg install bash</tt></p>

	  <p><tt>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash</tt></p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Build Ceph:</p>

	  <p><tt>git clone https://github.com/wjwithagen/ceph.git</tt></p>

	  <p><tt>cd ceph</tt></p>

	  <p><tt>git checkout wip-wjw-freebsd-tests</tt></p>

	  <p><tt>./do_freebsd.sh</tt></p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Parts Not Yet Included:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>RBD: Rados Block Devices are currently implemented in the
	  Linux kernel but there used to be a userspace
	  implementation.  It is possible that <tt>ggated</tt> could
	  be used as a template since it provides some of the same
	  functionality and it has a userspace counterpart.</li>

	<li>BlueStore: &os; and Linux have a different AIO API which
	  needs to be made compatible.  There has been some
	  discussion about <tt>aio_cancel</tt> not working for all
	  device types in &os;.</li>

	<li>CephFS: Cython tries to access an internal field in dirent
	  which does not compile.</li>

	<li>Tests that verify the correct working of the above are
	  also excluded from the testset.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Tests Not Yet Included:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>ceph-detect-init/run-tox.sh</tt>: the current
	  implementation does not know anything about &os;
	  <tt>rc-init</tt>.</li>

	<li>Tests that make use of <tt>nosestests</tt> do not really
	  work since <tt>nostests</tt> is not in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>,
	  and calling <tt>/usr/bin/env/nosetests</tt> does not work on
	  &os;.</li>

	<li><tt>test/pybind/test_ceph_argparse.py</tt></li>

	<li><tt>test/pybind/test_ceph_daemon.py</tt></li>

      <task>The current and foremost task it to get the test set to
	complete without errors.</task>

      <task>Build an automated test platform that will build
	<tt>ceph/master</tt> on &os; and report the results back to
	the Ceph developers.  This will increase the maintainability
	of the &os; side of things as developers are signaled that
	they are using Linux-isms that will not compile or run on
	&os;.  Ceph has several projects that support this: Jenkins,
	teuthology, and palpito.  But even a
	<tt>while { compile }</tt> loop that reports the build data on
	a static webpage is a good start.</task>

      <task>Run integration tests to see if the &os; daemons will work

    </links>

    <body>
      <p>After being in the &os; Ports Collection for three months,
	GitLab continues to mature and gain adoption.  Most of its
	starting problems have been resolved, with one known issue
	left: it does not start on boot.  Any help in solving this
	issue is welcome.</p>

      <p>Staying in sync with upstream is now easy for minor versions.
	But, some of the monthly major releases create a big workload
	by introducing a number of new dependencies.  This makes
	testing and updating an expensive process.</p>

      <p>The GitLab project itself now mentions native support on
	&os;, which is quite a commendation.</p>

      <p>Current work aims to fix the open problems, get the latest
	major version into the port, and create the documentation for
	the update progress.</p>

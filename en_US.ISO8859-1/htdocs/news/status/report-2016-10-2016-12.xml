    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Another year has passed (and another has gotten well
      underway, while we worked to assemble this report).  Over the
      past two years that I have been part of the monthly@ team that
      assembles these reports, it has been enlightening to watch the
      individual entries pass through my emacs and/or vim.  These
      reports give me a picture of what is going on with &os; that I
      could not get just from reading commit mail; I hope that is
      also true for our readers.</p>

    <p>This quarter brings the usual mix of continuations of many
      stalwart projects and entires of new participants, as well as
      the return of some items after a few quarters' hiatus.  Enjoy
      and be enlightened!</p>

    <p>&mdash;Benjamin Kaduk</p>

    <p>The deadline for submissions covering the period from January
      to March 2017 is April 7, 2017.</p>

      <p>This report covers work since the last &os;/EC2 status report
	(2015Q1).</p>

      <p>&os;/EC2 is now part of the regular &os; release build,
	with snapshots and releases being automatically uploaded and
	copied to all available regions.  Due to legal restrictions,
	this does not currently include the GovCloud or China
	(Beijing) regions; anyone wishing to use &os; in those regions
	is encouraged to contact the author.</p>

      <p>The AWS Marketplace reports that approximately 800 users
	are running roughly 2000 &os; EC2 instances.  This does not
	count the likely significantly larger number of EC2 instances
	launched directly through the EC2 API and Console, but at
	least places a lower bound on usage.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE shipped with support for the &quot;enhanced
	networking&quot; capabilities of EC2 C3, C4, R3, I2, D2, and M4
	(excluding m4.16xlarge) instances.  This provides
	significantly higher network performance than the virtual
	networking available on older EC2 instances and with older
	versions of &os;.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE and later also use indirect segment disk
	I/Os, which yield approximately 20% higher throughput with
	equal or lower latency, and support the 128-vCPU x1.32xlarge
	instance type.</p>

      <p> &os; now supports the Amazon Simple Systems Manager service
	(&quot;run command&quot;).</p>

    <body>
      <p>Prometheus is an Open Source monitoring system that was
	originally built at SoundCloud in 2012.  Since 2016, this
	project is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
	together with other projects like Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>Prometheus scrapes its targets by periodically sending HTTP
	GET requests.  Targets then respond by sending key-value pairs
	of metrics and their sample value.  Prometheus has a query
	language, PromQL, that can be used to aggregate sample values
	and specify alerting conditions.  Tools like Grafana can be
	used to create fancy dashboards using such queries.</p>

      <p>The Prometheus project provides a utility called
	<tt>node_exporter</tt> that gathers basic system metrics and serves
	them over HTTP.  This utility tends to be rather complex, as
	it has to extract metrics from many different sources.  On
	Linux, files in <tt>/proc</tt> have no uniform format, meaning
	that for every kernel framework a custom collector needs to be
	written.</p>

      <p>On &os; the sitiuation is better, as the data exported
	through <tt>sysctl</tt> is already structured in such a way
	that it can easily be translated to Prometheus' metrics
	format.  The goal of this project is thus to provide a generic
	exporter for the entire sysctl tree.  Not only does this
	prevent unnecessary bloat and indirection, it may also make
	the life of a kernel developer a lot easier.  One can easily
	use Prometheus to graph the occurrence of an event over time
	by (temporarily) adding a counter to the kernel.</p>

      <p>An initial version of the sysctl exporter has been integrated
	into the &os; base system in December.  It can be run through
	<tt>inetd</tt> by uncommenting the example provided in
	<tt>inetd.conf</tt>.  Unfortunately, this exporter cannot be
	merged back to &os; 10.x/11.x, as it depends on KBI-breaking
	changes to <tt>sysctl(9)</tt>.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Are you using Prometheus or are you interested in using
	it?  Be sure to give both Prometheus and this <tt>sysctl</tt>
	exporter a try!</task>

      <task>It would be nice if we created a set of useful alerting
	rules and placed those in <tt>/usr/share/examples</tt>.  For example,
	how can one use this exporter to monitor the state of
	GEOM-based RAID arrays?  Is such information even exported
	through <tt>sysctl</tt>?</task>

      <task>Prometheus uses a rather clever format for exporting
	histograms.  Histograms are useful for expressing the amount
	of time taken to complete certain events (for example, disk
	operations).  Would it be possible to add histograms as native
	data types to <tt>sysctl</tt>?  If so, is there any chance they can be
	implemented without picking up any kernel locks?</task>

      <p>Libarchive is a BSD-licensed archive and compression library
	originally developed as part of &os;.  It supports a wide
	variety of input and output formats and also includes three
	command-line tools: <tt>bsdcat</tt>, <tt>bsdcpio</tt> and
	<tt>bsdtar</tt>.  The &os; <tt>tar</tt> and <tt>cpio</tt>
	utilities are taken directly from Libarchive, and many other
	important utilities like <tt>ar</tt>, <tt>unzip</tt>, and the
	<tt>pkg</tt> package manager make use of <tt>libarchive</tt>'s
	functions.</p>

      <p>Libarchive development in 2016 has been focusing on bug fixes
	and code cleanup, including fixing several critical security
	issues.  Automated testing with Travis CI and Jenkins has been
	introduced and <tt>libarchive</tt> has been added to the
	Google OSS-Fuzz project.  Fuzzing helped detect several hidden
	problems like buffer overflows and memory leaks.</p>

      <p>Over the last few months, NFSv4 ACL support for the pax and
	restricted pax (the default for <tt>bsdtar</tt>) formats has
	been completed and merged to &os;-CURRENT.  NFSv4 ACL entries
	can now be stored to and restored from tar archives.</p>

      <task>As every commit to <tt>libarchive</tt> may influence the build

      <p>OpenBSM is a BSD-licensed implementation of Sun's Basic
	Security Module (BSM) API and file format.  It is the
	user-space side of the CAPP Audit implementations in &os; and
	Mac OS X. Additionally, the audit trail processing tools are
	expected to work on Linux.</p>

      <p>This quarter saw increased development activity, fueled by
	the DARPA CADETS project, resulting in the release of OpenBSM
	1.2 alpha 5.  Among this release's changes are the ability to
	specify the kernel's maximum audit queue length, sandboxing
	support for <tt>auditreduce(1)</tt> and <tt>praudit(1)</tt> on
	&os; and other systems that support Capsicum, as well as the

    <title>The &os; Core Team</title>

    <contact>
      <person>
	<name>&os; Core Team</name>
	<email>core@FreeBSD.org</email>
      </person>
    </contact>

    <body>
      <p>The major concern for Core during the last quarter of 2016
	has been about maintaining the effectiveness of secteam.  The
	team is primarily in need of better project management, both
	to improve communication generally and to allow the other team
	members to concentrate on the technical aspects of handling
	vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>To that end, there has been agreement in principle for either
	the FreeBSD Foundation or one of the companies that are major
	&os; users to employ someone specifically in this role.</p>

      <p>Core confirmed that the new support model would go into
	effect with 11.0-RELEASE despite the postponement of the
	switch to a packaged base release mechanism.  For details of
	the new support model, please follow the links from the
	<a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/security.html">security</a>
	page of the &os; website.</p>

      <p>Core requested the removal of the <tt>misc/jive</tt> port, on
	the grounds that it had no function other than to turn text
	into an offensively racist parody.  This proved controversial,
	with many seeing this as a first step in bowdlerizing the
	entire ports tree.  That is certainly not Core's intention.
	Core's aim here is to help secure the future of the &os;
	project by making it welcoming to all contributors, regardless
	of ethnicity, gender, sexuality or other improper bases for
	discrimintation.  While <tt>misc/jive</tt> may once have been
	seen as harmless fun, today the implicit approval implied by
	having it in the ports tree sends a message at odds with the
	project's aims.</p>

      <p>The Marketing team and the associated marketing@FreeBSD.org
	mailing list were wound up, due to lack of activity.  Messages
	to marketing@FreeBSD.org will be forwarded to the FreeBSD
	Foundation's marketing team instead.</p>

      <p>Core member Allan Jude, who was already the clusteradm
	liason, became a full member of clusteradm.</p>

      <p>An emergency correction to the 11.0 release notes was
	authorised, as it was giving the misleading impression that
	802.11n wireless support had only just been added, and this
	misapprehension was being repeated in the press.  In reality,
	&os; has had 802.11n support for many years, and the
	announcement should have said that support had been added to
	many additional device drivers.</p>

      <p>Discussions about a proposal to improve Unicode support are
	on-going.  &os; is already standards conformant, but the
	propsal is to switch to a <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646_</tt>
	implementation, similar to what Linux glibc currently uses.
	Opinions are divided on the technical merits of the new
	approach.</p>

      <p>There were the usual quota of queries about licensing and
	other legal matters:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  Plans to create a GPLv3 overlay for the base system were
	  shelved in the light of faster than expected progress at
	  enabling building the world using an external
	  toolchain.
	</li>

	<li>
	  The trademarks page on the website was updated to show the
	  current owners of a number of trademarks in their approved
	  form.
	</li>

	<li>
	  In the absence of a tool to extract and summarize all of
	  the relevant information, the obligation in the BSD license
	  that &quot;Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the
	  above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the
	  following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other
	  materials provided with the distribution.&quot; is fulfilled
	  by providing a tarball of the system sources with their
	  embedded copyright statements.
	</li>

	<li>
	  The European Court of Justice's &quot;Right to be
	  Forgotten&quot; only applies to search engines, and the &os;
	  project is not one of those, so it need not take any
	  action.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Core is following closely discussions within the LLVM
	  project regarding a change of license which, if implemented,
	  might require an audit of the entire ports tree to discover
	  all packages that contain binaries linked against libc++ and
	  ensure that they are licensed compatibly with LLVM.
	  However, indications are that the LLVM project will not
	  adopt such changes.
	</li>

	<li>
	  The &quot;Open Source Exception&quot; in the firmware
	  license means that committing a &quot;binary blob&quot;
	  driver for the Nvidia Jetson TK1 XHCI device is
	  acceptable.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During this quarter four new commit bits were awarded.
	Please welcome Dexuan Cui, David Bright, Konrad Witaszczyk,
	and Piotr Stefaniak.  We were sorry to see Edwin Lansing hang
	up his commit bits and step down from portmgr.</p>

      <p>The Ports Tree has reached the marker of 27,000 ports, with
	the PR count risen slightly to around 2,250.  Of these PRs,
	572 are unassigned.  The last quarter saw 6871 commits by 176
	committers.  The number of open and the number of unassigned
	PRs both increased lightly since last quarter.</p>

      <p>Two commit bits were taken in for safe keeping in the last
	quarter: jmg after 19 months of inactivity, and edwin at his
	own request.  We welcomed three new committers: Nikolai
	Lifanov (lifanov), Jason Bacon, and Mikhail Pchelin
	(misha).</p>

      <p>On the management side, adamw and feld were elected as new
	portmgr members, and rene was promoted to full member.  feld
	is already involved in ports-secteam.</p>

      <p>On the infrastructure side, two new USES (lxqt and varnish)
	were introduced.  Some default versions were also updated:
	varnish 4 (new), GCC 4.8 to 4.9, Perl 5.20 to 5.24, and Python
	3.4 to 3.5.  Two major ports reached their end-of-life at
	December 31st and were removed: Perl 5.18 and Linux Fedora 10
	(the default is Linux CentOS 6).  Because &os; 9.3, 10.1, and
	10.2 also reached end-of-life, support for those versions was
	removed from the Ports Tree.</p>

      <p>Some major ports were updated to their latest versions: <tt>pkg</tt>
	to 1.9.4, Firefox to 50.1.0, Firefox-esr to 45.6.0, Chromium
	to 54.0.2840.100, and Ruby to 2.1.10 / 2.2.6 / 2.3.3.
	<tt>www/node</tt> was updated to version 7; version 6 was

      <p>The MinnowBoard is an Atom-based x86 board (Intel E38xx
	Series SoC) in a maker-friendly form-factor: it provides
	convenient access to pins that can be used to connect
	peripherals using one of the standard buses: GPIO, SPI, or
	I2C. These buses are more common in the ARM/MIPS world than in
	x86, so while &os; was able to boot just fine, it lacked

    </links>

    <body>
      <p>Ceph is a distributed object store and file system designed
	to provide excellent performance, reliability and
	scalability:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>Object Storage</p>

	  <p>Ceph provides seamless access to objects using native
	    language bindings or <tt>radosgw</tt>, a REST interface that is
	    compatible with applications written for S3 and
	    Swift.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Block Storage</p>

	  <p>Ceph's RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block
	    device images that are striped and replicated across the
	    entire storage cluster.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>File System</p>

	  <p>Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file system that
	    aims for high performance, large data storage, and maximum
	    compatibility with legacy applications.</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I started looking into Ceph because the HAST solution with
	CARP and <tt>ggate</tt> did not really do what I was looking
	for.  But I aim to run a Ceph storage cluster of storage nodes
	that are running ZFS.  User stations would be running
	<tt>bhyve</tt> on RBD disks that are stored in Ceph.</p>

      <p>The &os; build of Ceph includes most of the tools Ceph provides.  Note
	that the RBD-dependent items will not work, since &os; does
	not have RBD (yet).</p>

      <p>The most notable progress since the last report:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>RBD is actually buildable and can be used to manage
	  <tt>RADOS BLOCK DEVICE</tt>s.</li>

	<li>All tests run to completion for the current selection of
	  tools, though the neded (minor) patches have yet to be
	  pulled into HEAD.</li>

	<li>Cmake is now the only way of building Ceph.</li>

	<li>The threading/polling code has been reworked for the simple
	  socket code.  It now uses a self-pipe, instead of using an
	  odd <tt>shutdown()</tt>-signaling Linux feature.</li>

	<li>The EventKqueue code was modified to work around the
	  &quot;feature&quot; that starting threads destroys the
	  kqueue handles.  The code was just finshed, so it is not yet
	  submitted to the main repository.</li>

	<li>We investigated differences between &os; and Linux for
	  <tt>SO_REUSEADDR</tt> and <tt>SO_REUSEPORT</tt>.
	  Fortunately, the code is only used during testing, so
	  disabling these features only delays progress in the tests.</li>

	<li>A jenkins instances is regularly testing both
	  <tt>ceph/ceph/master</tt> and
	  <tt>wjwithagen/ceph/wip.FreeBSD</tt>, so there is regular
	  verification of buildability and the tests:
	  <a href="http://cephdev.digiware.nl:8180/jenkins/">http://cephdev.digiware.nl:8180/jenkins/</a>.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Build Prerequisites</p>

      <p>Compiling and building Ceph is tested on 12-CURRENT with
	its clang 3.9.0, but 11-RELEASE will probably also work, given
	experience with clang 3.7.0 from 11-CURRENT.  Interestingly,
	when 12-CURRENT had clang 3.8.0, that did not work as well as
	either 3.7.0 or 3.9.0.  The clang 3.4 present in 10-STABLE
	does not have the required capabilities to compile
	everything.</p>

      <p>The following setup will get things running for &os;:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Install bash and link it in <tt>/bin</tt></li>

	<li>It is no longer necessary to add a definition of
	  <tt>ENODATA</tt> to <tt>/usr/include/errno.h</tt></li>

	<li>Clone the github repo
	  (http://github.com/wjwithagen/ceph.git) and checkout the
	  &quot;wip.FreeBSD&quot; branch</li>

	<li>Run <tt>./do_FreeBSD.sh</tt> to start the build.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The old build method using automake is no longer used; see
	the README.FreeBSD for more details.</p>

      <p>Parts not (yet) included:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>KRBD: Kernel Rados Block Devices is implemented in the Linux
	  kernel, but not in the &os; kernel.  Perhaps <tt>ggated</tt>
	  could be used as a template since it does some of the same
	  things as KRBD, just between 2 disks.  It also has a
	  userspace counterpart, which could ease development.
	</li>

	<li>BlueStore: &os; and Linux have different AIO APIs, and
	  that incompatibility needs to be resolved somehow.
	  Additionally, there is discussion in &os; about
	  <tt>aio_cancel</tt> not working for all devicetypes.</li>

	<li>CephFS: Cython tries to access an internal field in
	  <tt>struct dirent</tt>, which does not compile.</li>

	<li>Tests that verify the correct working of the above are
	  also excluded from the testset.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Good progress on graphics support was made during the weeks
	around Christmas and the new year with the import of Linux
	4.9's DRM for <tt>i915</tt> and <tt>amdgpu</tt> into the
	drm-next branch of the github repository.  The <tt>amdgpu</tt>
	KMS driver is already somewhat usable, with a few major known
	issues remaining.  It now supports GPUs as far back as
	Southern Islands and up to Polaris.  The 4.9 update also
	appears to have fixed a regression in <tt>i915</tt> that was
	introduced by the 4.8 merge late this past summer.  The
	drm-next branch now supports the Intel integrated graphics
	unit up to Kaby Lake CPUs.  To facilitate out-of-the-box
	support on CURRENT, most of the branch-local VM changes were
	reverted and the graphics fault routines converted to use
	<tt>pg_populate</tt>.  This new interface is the source of a couple of
	regressions causing panics on <tt>i915</tt> and severe artifacts with
	<tt>amdgpu</tt> on integrated GPUs.  Mark Johnston (markj@) has
	volunteered to analyze these issues.  Please show your support
	and encouragement to Mark for helping to move this project
	towards the finish line.</p>

      <p>The xserver-mesa-next-udev branch was created for the ports
	development repository, and holds Mesa 13.0 and fixes for
	newer AMD GPUs.  It uses a fork of the <tt>libudev-devd</tt> shim, also
	bringing Mesa closer to the Linux upstream.  I plan to keep
	updating <tt>drm</tt> and <tt>amdgpu</tt> (for use on my
	desktop and potentially longer term for GPGPU computations) as
	well as work with Mark to address the existing bugs in
	<tt>i915</tt> (assuming that two new porters are approved).
	However, the Linux <tt>i915</tt> developers seem to
	aggressively explore the space of possible implementations and
	use of Linux internal APIs, making it prohibitively time
	consuming to track upstream.  I am helping someone to learn
	the ropes of how to replay a subset of changes from a Linux
	release into &os; in the hope that he will take over the
	mantle of drm-next <tt>i915</tt> maintainer.  Assuming the
	issues listed above are addressed, a port of the linuxkpi,
	DRM, and KMS drivers for use on standard amd64 CURRENT
	installations is planned.  Together with upgrades to the
	relevant graphics ports, this will provide experimental
	support for new AMD and Intel GPUs.</p>

      <p>LLD is the linker in the LLVM family of projects.  It is a
	high-performance linker that supports the ELF, COFF and Mach-O
	object formats.  It aims to be compatible with the common
	linkers used for each file format.  For ELF this is the GNU
	Binary File Descriptor (BFD) ld and GNU gold.  However, LLD's
	authors are not constrained by strict compatibility where it
	would hamper performance or desired functionality.</p>

      <p>LLD developers made significant progress over the last
	quarter.  With changes committed to both LLD and &os; we
	reached a major milestone: it is now possible to link the
	entire &os;/amd64 base system (kernel and userland)
	with LLD.</p>

      <p>Now that the base system links with LLD, we have started
	investigating linking applications in the ports tree with LLD.
	Through this process we are identifying limitations or bugs in
	both LLD and a number of &os; ports.  With a few
	work-in-progress patches we can link approximately 95% of the
	ports collection with LLD on amd64.</p>

      <p>Reproducible builds are a set of software development
	practices which create a verifiable path from human readable
	source code to the binary code used by computers.  A build is
	reproducible if given the same source code, build environment
	and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-for-bit
	identical copies of all specified artifacts.</p>

      <p>Baptiste Daroussin and Ed Maste attended the second
	Reproducible Builds Summit last December, in Berin.  We
	discussed issues of common interest to operating system
	providers, including other BSDs and Linux distributions.</p>

      <p>Following the summit, changes were committed to the &os;
	base system to address outstanding sources of
	non-reproducibility.  It is now possible to build the &os;
	base system (kernel and userland) completely reproducibly,
	although it currently requires a few non-default settings.</p>

      <p>Approximately 80% of the ports tree builds reproducibly,
	with a few work-in-progress patches.  Now that the base system
	can be built reproducibly, focus will move on to the ports
	tree.</p>

      <p>Long awaited, the update to GCC 4.9 as the default version of
	GCC in the Ports Collection (<tt>lang/gcc</tt> port,
	<tt>USE_GCC=yes</tt> in Makefiles) has arrived, an update from GCC
	4.8. This brings quite a number of improvements; see
	<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html</a>
	for details.</p>

      <p><tt>lang/gcc49</tt> has moved to the GCC 4.9.4 release which
	marks the closure of the GCC 4.9 branch and release
	series.</p>

      <p>(Yes, this means we should rather get the next version
	upgrade for <tt>lang/gcc</tt> in place soon.  That update per
	se is straightforward, but any help in addressing the fallout
	of broken ports would be great &mdash; please let us know if
	you want to help!)</p>

      <p><tt>lang/gcc6</tt> has been updated first to GCC 6.2 and then
	GCC 6.3, bringing a fair number of fixes, and should now be
	suitable for production use.</p>

      <p>Support for accessing floating-point registers from the kernel has been
	added.  This uses the same KPI as i386 and amd64.  This will
	allow for handling places where the floating-point state may
	be modified, for example when calling into UEFI.</p>

      <p>Support for the optional ARMv8 AES instructions was added to
	the kernel.  This makes use of the ability to store and
	restore the floating point state.  Tests have shown a
	significant improvement in AES performance on ThunderX
	hardware.</p>

      <p>The Cortex Strings <tt>memcpy</tt> and <tt>memmove</tt>
	functions have been imported into the kernel.  These are
	optimised implementations of these common functions.</p>

      <p>&os; now boots on the SoftIron Overdrive 3000 using ACPI.
	The needed changes for this have been submitted to phabricator
	for review.  This includes booting with SMP enabled, and all
	currently supported devices.</p>

      <p>Support for the Raspberry Pi 3 has been committed.  Most

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
	dedicated to supporting and promoting the &os; Project and
	community worldwide.  Funding comes from individual and
	corporate donations and is used to fund and manage software
	development projects, conferences and developer summits, and
	provide travel grants to &os; contributors.  The Foundation
	purchases and supports hardware to improve and maintain &os;
	infrastructure; publishes marketing material to promote,
	educate, and advocate for the &os; Project; facilitates
	collaboration between commercial vendors and &os; developers;
	and finally, represents the &os; Project in executing
	contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements
	that require a recognized legal entity.</p>

      <p>Here are some highlights of what we did to help &os; last
	quarter:</p>

      <p>Fundraising Efforts</p>

      <p>Our work is 100% funded by your donations.  We raised
	$1,527,540 in 2016 from 1471 donors!  Thank you to everyone
	who made a donation to help us continue our efforts in 2017 to
	support the &os; Project and community worldwide!  You can
	make a donation here to our 2017 fundraising campaign:
	<a href="https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/">https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/</a>.</p>

      <p>OS Improvements</p>

      <p>The Foundation improves the &os; operating system by
	employing our technical staff to maintain and improve critical
	kernel subsystems, add features and functionality, and fix
	problems.  This also includes funding separate project grants
	like the arm64 port, <tt>blacklistd</tt> access control
	daemon, and integration of VIMAGE support, to make sure that &os;
	remains a viable solution for research, education, computing,
	products and more.</p>

      <p>Large projects supported last year include:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>arm64 port</li>

	<li>VIMAGE Integration</li>

	<li>Toolchain work</li>

	<li><tt>blacklistd</tt> access control daemon</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Foundation team worked on a technology roadmap for
	2017&ndash;2018 during our board meeting in November.</p>

      <p>Staff and board members continued hosting bi-weekly
	conference calls to facilitate efforts for individuals to
	collaborate on different technologies.</p>

      <p>You can find out more about the support we provided by
	reading individual updates from Ed Maste, Konstatin Belousov,
	and Edward Napierala in this report.</p>

      <p>Release Engineering</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides a full-time staff member to lead the
	release engineering efforts.  This has provided timely and
	reliable releases over the last few years.</p>

      <p>Last quarter, our full-time staff member worked with the
	&os; Release Engineering and Security Teams to finalize
	11.0-RELEASE.  He also added support for the powerpcspe
	architecture to the 12-CURRENT snapshot builds, and continued
	work on packaging the base system with <tt>pkg(8)</tt>.  He
	also continued producing 10-STABLE, 11-STABLE, and 12-CURRENT
	development snapshot builds throughout the quarter.</p>

      <p>You can find out more about the support we provided to the
	Release Engineering Team by reading their status update in
	this report.</p>

      <p>Supporting &os; Infrastructure</p>

      <p>The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve the
	&os; infrastructure.  This year, we purchased the following
	hardware to improve the build, continuous integration, and
	platform processes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A server to reduce the build time from over an hour to 20
	  minutes for the continuous integration process.  You can
	  find out more information here:
	  <a href="https://ci.FreeBSD.org/">https://ci.FreeBSD.org/</a>.</li>

	<li>Two ThunderX servers for native package builds for the
	  &os;/arm64 architecture.</li>

	<li>Two servers to improve release engineering builds.</li>

	<li>Four servers to improve package builds.</li>

	<li>Four servers as build slaves to increase the number of
	  builds in the continuous integration process.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&os; Advocacy and Education</p>

      <p>A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for
	the Project.  This includes promoting work being done by
	others with &os;; producing advocacy literature to teach
	people about &os; and help make the path to starting using
	&os; or contributing to the Project easier; and attending and
	getting other &os; contributors to volunteer to run &os;
	events, staff &os; tables, and give &os; presentations.</p>

      <p>Here is a list highlighting some of the advocacy and
	education work we did last year:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Attended and/or sponsored 24 events around the world</li>

      <p>Conferences and Events</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and
	summits around the globe.  These events can be BSD-related,
	open source, or technology events geared towards
	underrepresented groups.</p>

      <p>We support the &os;-focused events to help provide a venue
	for sharing knowledge, to work together on projects, and to
	facilitate collaboration between developers and commercial
	users.  This all helps provide a healthy ecosystem.  We
	support the non-&os; events to promote and raise awareness
	of &os;, to increase the use of &os; in different
	applications, and to recruit more contributors to the
	Project.</p>

      <p>We also sponsored or attended the following events last
	quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Ohio LinuxFest, October, Columbus, Ohio</li>

	<li>Grace Hopper 2016, October, Houston, TX</li>

	<li>COSC 2016, October, Beijing, China</li>

	<li>Bay Area &os; Vendor and Devoloper's Summit and MeetBSD
	  2016, November, Berkely, CA</li>

	<li>USENIX LISA '16, December, Boston, MA</li>

	<li>OSC 2016, December, Beijing, China</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Legal/&os; IP</p>

      <p>The Foundation owns the &os; trademarks, and it is our
	responsibility to protect them.  We continued to review
	requests and grant permission to use the trademarks.  We also
	provided legal support for the core team to investigate the
	status of certain patents.</p>

      <p>&os; Community Engagement</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison, our Marketing Director, has been overseeing
	the efforts to rewrite the Project's Code of Conduct to help
	make this a safe, inclusive, and welcoming community.  The
	updated Code of Conduct and Report Guidelines are going
	through the final review process, and will be handed off to
	the Core Team for approval in Q1 2017.</p>

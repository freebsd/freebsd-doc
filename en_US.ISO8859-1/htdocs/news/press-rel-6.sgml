<h3>The Daemon of the Opera: Opera Software Releases Version for FreeBSD</h3>

<p><b>Oslo, Norway, October 31, 2002:</b> Opera Software is proud to 
announce the first golden release of its new port to the UNIX variance 
FreeBSD. With FreeBSD joining the Opera family, Opera is now available on 
eight different operating systems.</p>

<p>The BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) operating system has its origins 
at the University of California, Berkeley. It started out as a supplement to 
UNIX, but over time it evolved into several operating systems. Of the 
different BSD flavors available, the most widely distributed is FreeBSD, 
popular among high-end users like system administrators who are looking for a 
fast, reliable operating system.</p>

<p><cite>"Opera and FreeBSD´s users are alike in that they emphasize and 
expect stability and reliability. The match between FreeBSD and Opera should 
strike a cord with many enterprise customers,"</cite> says Jon S. von 
Tetzchner, CEO, Opera Software ASA. <cite>"On a personal level, I'm also happy 
to welcome FreeBSD users into the Opera family. FreeBSD is strictly not only 
an operating system, but also a community and a philosophy with values I know 
resonate well with our own."</cite></p>

<p>The FreeBSD community is enthusiastic to finally be able to surf with 
Opera.</p>

<p><cite>"With the release of Opera for FreeBSD, FreeBSD users who download 
Opera for FreeBSD can browse the Web with one of the fastest browsers 
available on the market,"</cite> says Robert Watson, FreeBSD Core Team member. 
<cite>"FreeBSD´s reputation as a reliable and fast desktop operating system is 
becoming widely known, and we are glad to see that Opera Software is helping 
us create a more complete desktop environment."</cite></p>

<p>Opera 6.1 for FreeBSD can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/">www.opera.com</a>.</p>

<h3>About the Berkeley Software Distribution Operating System</h3>

<p>Berkeley Software Distribution operating system technologies were 
originally developed from 1979 to 1992 by the Computer Systems Research 
Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley. Berkeley-derived 
operating system and networking technologies are at the heart of most modern 
Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Today, virtually every major Internet 
infrastructure provider uses BSD operating systems. BSD operating system 
technologies are used by leading mission- critical network computing 
environments and are embedded in Internet appliance platforms that require 
advanced Internet functionality, reliability and security.</p>

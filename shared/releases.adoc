// XXX rel.current and u-rel-* should be available in doc/
// The currently released versions of FreeBSD.  This value is used to
// create some links on web sites and such, so do NOT change it until
// it's really release time.  When you update this, you should also
// update (at least) the following:
//
// -similar entity in the Handbook
// -similar entity in the Relnotes
// -releases/index.adoc has the date of the current release
// -the FAQ has links to the release FTP url
// -"versions supported" in security.adoc
//
// (If you're the release engineer, feel free to update this list with
// other doc-related things you had to do.  It'll save you time and
// trouble the next time around :-).)
//
// As of 5.0, we now have the concept of two different "currently"
// released versions (from two different development branches).  Use
// rel.* and u-rel-* for the "latest and greatest" version and
// rel2.* and u-rel2-* for the "conservative users" version.

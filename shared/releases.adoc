// XXX rel.current and u-rel-* should be available in doc/
// The currently released versions of FreeBSD.  This value is used to
// create some links on web sites and such, so do NOT change it until
// it's really release time.  When you update this, you should also
// update (at least) the following:
// 
// -similar entity in the Handbook
// -similar entity in the Relnotes
// -releases/index.adoc has the date of the current release
// -the FAQ has links to the release FTP url
// -"versions supported" in security.adoc
// 
// (If you're the release engineer, feel free to update this list with
// other doc-related things you had to do.  It'll save you time and
// trouble the next time around :-).)
// 
// As of 5.0, we now have the concept of two different "currently"
// released versions (from two different development branches).  Use
// rel.* and u-rel-* for the "latest and greatest" version and
// rel2.* and u-rel2-* for the "conservative users" version.

// Number of ports

// Release-specific macros to help keep other macros such as
// rel.current up-to-date without needing to do an entire tree
// sweep.  This allows switching rel.current, rel1.current, and
// rel2.current versions below with updated macros here, ultimately
// touching as few files as necessary.
// 
// Note, this is a first pass at this structure, and by no means
// fully complete yet.  I plan to followup on this and expand it
// more (in addition to cleaning up this file) following the 11.3
// release (likely as part of the 11.3 announcement commit). -gjb

     Words that were deemed too controversial.  Which, therefore,
     would require several futher revisions.  Moreover, the use of
     entities helps normalize (a uniform) the translation process.

     Use these entities instead of direct translations whenever
     possible.

     IMPORTANT:  If you delete words from this file you *must* ensure that
                 all references to them have been removed from the handbook's
                 translations.  If they haven't then you *will* break the
                 builds for the other languages, and we will poke fun of you
                 in public.

  <title>The Working Copy</title>

  <para>The <emphasis>working copy</emphasis> is a copy of the &os;
    repository documentation tree downloaded onto the local computer.
    Changes are made to the local working copy, tested, and then
    submitted as patches to be committed to the main
    repository.</para>

  <para>A full copy of the documentation tree can occupy 700 megabytes
    of disk space.  Allow for a full gigabyte of space to have room
    for temporary files and test versions of various output
    formats.</para>

  <para><link
      xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/svn.html"><application>Subversion</application></link>
    is used to manage the &os; documentation files.  It is obtained by
    installing the <application>Subversion</application>
    package:</para>

  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install subversion</userinput></screen>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-doc-and-src">
    <title>Documentation and Manual Pages</title>

    <para>&os; documentation is not just books and articles.  Manual
      pages for all the commands and configuration files are also part
      of the documentation, and part of the <acronym>FDP</acronym>'s
      territory.  Two repositories are involved:
      <literal>doc</literal> for the books and articles, and
      <literal>base</literal> for the operating system and manual
      pages.  To edit manual pages, the <literal>base</literal>
      repository must be checked out separately.</para>

    <para>Repositories may contain multiple versions of documentation
      and source code.  New modifications are almost always made only
      to the latest version, called <literal>head</literal>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-choosing-directory">
    <title>Choosing a Directory</title>

    <para>&os; documentation is traditionally stored in
      <filename>/usr/doc/</filename>, and system
      source code with manual pages in
      <filename>/usr/src/</filename>.  These
      directory trees are relocatable, and users may want to put the
      working copies in other locations to avoid interfering with
      existing information in the main directories.  The examples
      that follow use <filename>~/doc</filename>
      and <filename>~/src</filename>, both
      subdirectories of the user's home directory.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-checking-out">
    <title>Checking Out a Copy</title>

    <para>A download of a working copy from the repository is called
      a <emphasis>checkout</emphasis>, and done with
      <command>svn checkout</command>.  This example checks out a
      copy of the latest version (<literal>head</literal>) of
      the main documentation tree:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>A checkout of the source code to work on manual pages is
      very similar:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/head <replaceable>~/src</replaceable></userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-updating">
    <title>Updating a Working Copy</title>

    <para>The documents and files in the &os; repository change daily.
      People modify files and commit changes frequently.  Even a short
      time after an initial checkout, there will already be
      differences between the local working copy and the main &os;
      repository.  To update the local version with the changes that
      have been made to the main repository, use
      <command>svn update</command> on the directory containing the
      local working copy:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn update <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Get in the protective habit of using
      <command>svn update</command> before editing document files.
      Someone else may have edited that file very recently, and the
      local working copy will not include the latest changes until it
      has been updated.  Editing the newest version of a file is much
      easier than trying to combine an older, edited local file with
      the newer version from the repository.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-revert">
    <title>Reverting Changes</title>

    <para>Sometimes it turns out that changes were
      not necessary after all, or the writer just wants to start over.
      Files can be <quote>reset</quote> to their unchanged form with
      <command>svn revert</command>.  For example, to erase the edits
      made to <filename>chapter.xml</filename> and reset it to
      unmodified form:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn revert chapter.xml</userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-making-diff">
    <title>Making a Diff</title>

    <para>After edits to a file or group of files are completed, the
      differences between the local working copy and the version on
      the &os; repository must be collected into a single file for
      submission.  These <emphasis>diff</emphasis> files are produced
      by redirecting the output of <command>svn diff</command> into a
      file:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn diff &gt; <replaceable>doc-fix-spelling.diff</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Give the file a meaningful name that identifies the
      contents.  The example above is for spelling fixes to the whole
      documentation tree.</para>

    <para>If the diff file is to be submitted with the web
      <quote><link
	  xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi">Submit
	  a &os; problem report</link></quote> interface, add a
      <filename>.txt</filename> extension to give the earnest and
      simple-minded web form a clue that the contents are plain
      text.</para>

    <para>Be careful: <command>svn diff</command> includes all changes
      made in the current directory and any subdirectories.  If there
      are files in the working copy with edits that are not ready to
      be submitted yet, provide a list of only the files that are to
      be included:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svn diff <replaceable>disks/chapter.xml printers/chapter.xml</replaceable> &gt; <replaceable>disks-printers.diff</replaceable></userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-subversion-references">
    <title><application>Subversion</application> References</title>

    <para>These examples show very basic usage of
      <application>Subversion</application>.  More detail is available
      in the <link
	xlink:href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion
	Book</link> and the <link
	xlink:href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/">Subversion
	documentation</link>.</para>

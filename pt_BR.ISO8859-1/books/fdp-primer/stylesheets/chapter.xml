  <title>Style Sheets</title>

  <para><acronym>XML</acronym> is concerned with content, and says
    nothing about how that content should be presented to the reader
    or rendered on paper.  Multiple <emphasis>style sheet</emphasis>
    languages have been developed to describe visual layout, including
    Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation
    (<acronym>XSLT</acronym>), Document Style Semantics and
    Specification Language (<acronym>DSSSL</acronym>), and Cascading
    Style Sheets (<acronym>CSS</acronym>).</para>

  <para>The <acronym>FDP</acronym> documents use
    <acronym>XSLT</acronym> stylesheets to transform DocBook into
    <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, and then <acronym>CSS</acronym>
    formatting is applied to the <acronym>XHTML</acronym> pages.
    Printable output is currently rendered with legacy
    <acronym>DSSSL</acronym> stylesheets, but this will probably
    change in the future.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="stylesheets-css">
    <title><acronym>CSS</acronym></title>

    <para>Cascading Style Sheets (<acronym>CSS</acronym>) are a
      mechanism for attaching style information (font, weight, size,
      color, and so forth) to elements in an <acronym>XHTML</acronym>
      document without abusing <acronym>XHTML</acronym> to do
      so.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="stylesheets-css-documents">
      <title>The DocBook Documents</title>

      <para>The &os; <acronym>XSLT</acronym> and
	<acronym>DSSSL</acronym> stylesheets refer to
	<filename>docbook.css</filename>, which is expected to be
	present in the same directory as the <acronym>XHTML</acronym>
	files.  The project-wide <acronym>CSS</acronym> file is copied
	from <filename>doc/share/misc/docbook.css</filename> when
	documents are converted to <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, and is
	installed automatically.</para>

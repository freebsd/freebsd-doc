	  <H2>Security Update</H2>

     <P>A serious security problem affecting FreeBSD 2.1.6 and
	  earlier systems was found. The problem has been corrected
	  within the -stable, -current, and RELENG_2_2 source trees.
	  As an additional precaution, FreeBSD 2.1.6 is no longer
	  available from the FTP distribution sites. An update release
	  (provisionally "FreeBSD 2.1.7") is expected shortly.
	  </P>

	  <P>You can read more about the problem and solution from the
<A HREF="ftp://freebsd.org/pub/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-97:01.setlocale">
	  FreeBSD-SA-97:01.setlocale</A> security announcement.
	  </P>

For the latest information.

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.0:     1

o SA-98:08: IP fragmentation denial of service

Fix: Update to 3.0-current or apply patch supplied with advisory 98:08 in:

<a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-98:08.fragment.asc">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-98:08.fragment.asc</a>

---- System Update Information:

<strong>
o The GPL_MATH_EMULATE kernel option causes a fatal trap during system
  startup.</strong>

Fix: Replace the GPL_MATH_EMULATE option with the default math
     emulation option MATH_EMULATE.  This will only affect users who
     have modified their kernel configuration file.  The problem is
     corrected in revision 1.16 of the file 
     /usr/src/sys/gnu/i386/fpemul/fpu_entry.c.

<strong>
o DOS partition installs fail to find the installation bits.
</strong>
 
Fix: Rename C:\FREEBSD to C:\3.0-RELEASE and retry the installation. 
     The naming syntax was changed to make DOS more like the other 
     types of installation media but the docs on DOS installation 
     were not updated properly to reflect this.  The current sysinstall 
     now accepts both locations, as it should have to begin with.

  <title>Tools</title>

  <para>Several software tools are used to manage the FreeBSD
    documentation and render it to different output formats.  Some of
    these tools are required and must be installed before working
    through the examples in the following chapters.  Some are
    optional, adding capabilities or making the job of creating
    documentation less demanding.</para>

      <package>textproc/docproj</package> from the
      Ports Collection.  This <emphasis>meta-port</emphasis> installs
      all the applications required to do useful work with the &os;

      given below.</para>

      <para>&os; documentation uses several Document Type Definitions

	port.</para>

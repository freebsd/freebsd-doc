  <title>Using <literal>sgml-mode</literal> with
    <application>Emacs</application></title>

  <para>Recent versions of <application>Emacs</application> or
    <application>XEmacs</application> (available from the Ports
    Collection) contain a very useful package called PSGML (can be
    installed from <package>editors/psgml</package>).
    Automatically invoked when a file with the
    <filename>.xml</filename> extension is loaded, or by typing
    <command>M-x sgml-mode</command>, it is a major mode for dealing
    with SGML files, elements and attributes.</para>

  <para>An understanding of some of the commands provided by this mode
    can make working with SGML documents such as the Handbook much
    easier.</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c C-e</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-insert-element</function>.  You will
	  be prompted for the name of the element to insert at the
	  current point.  You can use the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key to
	  complete the element.  Elements that are not valid at the
	  current point will be disallowed.</para>

	<para>The start and end tags for the element will be inserted.
	  If the element contains other, mandatory, elements then
	  these will be inserted as well.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c =</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-change-element-name</function>.
	  Place the point within an element and run this command.  You
	  will be prompted for the name of the element to change to.
	  Both the start and end tags of the current element will be
	  changed to the new element.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c C-r</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-tag-region</function>. Select some
	  text (move to start of text, <command>C-space</command>,
	  move to end of text, <command>C-space</command>) and then
	  run this command.  You will be prompted for the element to
	  use.  This element will then be inserted immediately before
	  and after your marked region.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c -</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-untag-element</function>.  Place the
	  point within the start or end tag of an element you want to
	  remove, and run this command.  The element's start and end
	  tags will be removed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c C-q</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-fill-element</function>.  Will
	  recursively fill (i.e., reformat) content from the current
	  element in.  The filling <emphasis>will</emphasis> affect
	  content in which whitespace is significant, such as within
	  <tag>programlisting</tag> elements, so run this
	  command with care.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c C-a</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-edit-attributes</function>.  Opens a
	  second buffer containing a list of all the attributes for
	  the closest enclosing element, and their current values.
	  Use <keycap>Tab</keycap> to navigate between attributes,
	  <command>C-k</command> to remove an existing value and
	  replace it with a new one, <command>C-c C-c</command> to
	  close this buffer and return to the main document.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c C-v</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-validate</function>. Prompts you to
	  save the current document (if necessary) and then runs an
	  SGML validator.  The output from the validator is captured
	  into a new buffer, and you can then navigate from one
	  troublespot to the next, fixing markup errors as you
	  go.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><command>C-c /</command></term>

      <listitem>
	<para>Runs <function>sgml-insert-end-tag</function>.  Inserts
	  the end tag for the current open element.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>Doubtless there are other useful functions of this mode, but
    those are the ones I use most often.</para>

  <para>You can also use the following entries in
    <filename>.emacs</filename> to set proper spacing, indentation,
    and column width for working with the Documentation
    Project.</para>

  <programlisting>    (defun local-sgml-mode-hook
      (setq fill-column 70
            indent-tabs-mode nil
            next-line-add-newlines nil
            standard-indent 4
            sgml-indent-data t)
      (auto-fill-mode t)
      (setq sgml-catalog-files '("/usr/local/share/xml/catalog")))
    (add-hook 'psgml-mode-hook
      '(lambda () (local-psgml-mode-hook)))</programlisting>

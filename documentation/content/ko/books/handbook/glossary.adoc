The name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a sleep `mutex`) that protects a large set of kernel resources.
Although a simple locking mechanism was adequate in the days where a machine might have only a few dozen processes, one networking card, and certainly only one processor, in current times it is an unacceptable performance bottleneck.

The FreeBSD kernel uses a number of resource locks to arbitrate contention for those resources.
A run-time lock diagnostic system found in FreeBSD-CURRENT kernels (but removed for releases), called man:witness[4], detects the potential for deadlocks due to locking errors.
(man:witness[4] is actually slightly conservative, so it is possible to get false positives.)
A true positive report indicates that “if you were unlucky, a deadlock would have happened here”.
+

[[ports-synopsis]]
== Synopsis

FreeBSD is bundled with a rich collection of system tools as part of the base system.
In addition, FreeBSD provides two complementary technologies for installing third-party software: the FreeBSD Ports Collection,
for installing from source, and packages, for installing from pre-built binaries.
Either method may be used to install software from local media or from the network.

After reading this chapter, you will know:

* The difference between binary packages and ports.
* How to find third-party software that has been ported to FreeBSD.
* How to manage binary packages using pkg.
* How to build third-party software from source using the Ports Collection.
* How to find the files installed with the application for post-installation configuration.
* What to do if a software installation fails.

[[ports-overview]]
== Overview of Software Installation

A FreeBSD _port_ is a collection of files designed to automate the process of compiling an application from source code.
The files that comprise a port contain all the necessary information to automatically download, extract, patch, compile, and install the application.

If the software has not already been adapted and tested on FreeBSD, the source code might need editing in order for it to install and run properly.

However, over link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/[{numports}] third-party applications have already been ported to FreeBSD.
When feasible, these applications are made available for download as pre-compiled _packages_.

Packages can be manipulated with the FreeBSD package management commands.

Both packages and ports understand dependencies.
If a package or port is used to install an application and a dependent library is not already installed, the library will automatically be installed first.

A FreeBSD package contains pre-compiled copies of all the commands for an application, as well as any configuration files and documentation.
A package can be manipulated with the man:pkg[8] commands, such as `pkg install`.

While the two technologies are similar, packages and ports each have their own strengths.
Select the technology that meets your requirements for installing a particular application.

.Package Benefits
* A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than the compressed tarball containing the source code for the application.
* Packages do not require compilation time. For large applications, such as Firefox, KDE Plasma, or GNOME, this can be important on a slow system.
* Packages do not require any understanding of the process involved in compiling software on FreeBSD.

.Port Benefits
* Packages are normally compiled with conservative options because they have to run on the maximum number of systems. By compiling from the port, one can change the compilation options.
* Some applications have compile-time options relating to which features are installed. For example, NGINX(R) can be configured with a wide variety of different built-in options.
+
In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same application to specify certain settings. For example, NGINX(R) is available as a `nginx` package and a `nginx-lite` package, depending on whether or not Xorg is installed. Creating multiple packages rapidly becomes impossible if an application has more than one or two different compile-time options.
* The licensing conditions of some software forbid binary distribution. Such software must be distributed as source code which must be compiled by the end-user.
* Some people do not trust binary distributions or prefer to read through source code in order to look for potential problems.
* Source code is needed in order to apply custom patches.

To keep track of updated ports, subscribe to the {freebsd-ports} and the {freebsd-ports-bugs}.

[WARNING]
====
Before installing an application, check https://vuxml.freebsd.org/[] for security issues related to the application.

To check for known vulnerabilities of installed applications use use `pkg audit -F`.
====

The remainder of this chapter explains how to use packages and ports to install and manage third-party software on FreeBSD.

[[ports-finding-applications]]
== Finding Software

FreeBSD's list of available applications is growing all the time.
There are a number of ways to find software to install:

* The FreeBSD web site maintains an up-to-date searchable list of all the available applications, at link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/[Ports Portal]. The ports can be searched by application name or by software category.
* Dan Langille maintains https://www.freshports.org/[FreshPorts] which provides a comprehensive search utility and also tracks changes to the applications in the Ports Collection. Registered users can create a customized watch list in order to receive an automated email when their watched ports are updated.
* If finding a particular application becomes challenging, try searching a site like https://sourceforge.net/[SourceForge] or https://github.com/[GitHub] then check back at the link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/[Ports Portal] to see if the application has been ported.
* Search the binary package repository for an application using the man:pkg[8] command

[[pkgng-intro]]
== Using pkg for Binary Package Management

man:pkg[8] provides an interface for manipulating	packages: registering, adding, removing and upgrading packages.

For sites wishing to only use prebuilt binary packages from the FreeBSD mirrors, managing packages with man:pkg[8] can be sufficient.

However, for those sites building from source a separate <<ports-upgrading-tools, port management tool>> will be needed.

Since man:pkg[8] only works with binary packages, it is not a replacement for such tools.
Those tools can be used to install software from both binary packages and the Ports Collection, while man:pkg[8] installs only binary packages.

[[pkgng-initial-setup]]
=== Getting Started with pkg

All supported versions of FreeBSD now contain `/usr/sbin/pkg` a.k.a man:pkg[7].
This is a small placeholder that has just the minimum functionality required to install the real man:pkg[8].

[NOTE]
====
An Internet working connection is required for the bootstrap process to succeed.
====

Run man:pkg[8] command line:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
The package management tool is not yet installed on your system.
Do you want to fetch and install it not? [y/N]
....

man:pkg[7] will intercept the command, and if you confirm that is your intention, download the man:pkg[8] tarball, install man:pkg[8] from it, bootstrap the local package database and then proceed to run the command you originally requested.

More recent versions of man:pkg[7] understand `pkg -N` as a test to see if man:pkg[8] is installed without triggering the installation, and conversely, pkg bootstrap[-f] to install man:pkg[8] (or force it to be reinstalled) without performing any other actions.

Usage information for pkg is available in the man:pkg[8] manual page or by running `pkg` without additional arguments.
Additional pkg configuration options are described in man:pkg.conf[5].

Each pkg command argument is documented in a command-specific manual page.

To read the manual page for `pkg install`, for example, run this command:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg help install
....

The rest of this section demonstrates common binary package management tasks which can be performed using man:pkg[8].
Each demonstrated command provides many switches to customize its use.
Refer to a command's help or man page for details and more examples.

[[quarterly-latest-branch]]
=== Quarterly and Latest Ports Branches

The `Quarterly` branch provides users with a more predictable and stable experience for port and package installation and upgrades.
This is done essentially by only allowing non-feature updates.
Quarterly branches aim to receive security fixes (that may be version updates, or backports of commits), bug fixes and ports compliance or framework changes.
The Quarterly branch is cut from HEAD at the beginning of every (yearly) quarter in January, April, July, and October.
Branches are named according to the year (YYYY) and quarter (Q1-4) they are created in.
For example, the quarterly branch created in January 2023, is named 2023Q1.
And the `Latest` branch provides the latest versions of the packages to the users.

To switch man:pkg[8] from Quarterly to Latest run the following commands:

[source,shell]
....
# mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
# echo 'FreeBSD: { url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest" }' > /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
....

Then run this command to update the local package repositories catalogues for the Latest branch:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg update -f
....

[[pkg-configuration]]
=== Configure pkg

man:pkg.conf[5] is the system-wide configuration file used by the man:pkg[8] tools.
The default location of this file is `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`.

[NOTE]
====
FreeBSD does not need to have a `pkg.conf` file.
Many installations will work well with no `pkg.conf` at all or with an empty `pkg.conf` (other than comment lines).
====

Lines in the file beginning with a "#" are	comments and are ignored.

The file is in UCL format.
For more information on the syntax of man:libucl[3], please visit the link:https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl[official UCL website].

The following types of options are recognized - boolean, string and list options.

A boolean option is marked as enabled if one of the following values is specified in the configuration file - YES, TRUE and ON.

[[pkg-search]]
=== Searching Packages

To search a package man:pkg-search[8] can be used:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg search nginx
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
modsecurity3-nginx-1.0.3       Instruction detection and prevention engine / nginx Wrapper
nginx-1.22.1_2,3               Robust and small WWW server
nginx-devel-1.23.2_4           Robust and small WWW server
nginx-full-1.22.1_1,3          Robust and small WWW server (full package)
nginx-lite-1.22.1,3            Robust and small WWW server (lite package)
nginx-naxsi-1.22.1,3           Robust and small WWW server (plus NAXSI)
nginx-prometheus-exporter-0.10.0_7 Prometheus exporter for NGINX and NGINX Plus stats
nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker-4.2020.03.2005_1 Nginx bad bot and other things blocker
nginx-vts-exporter-0.10.7_7    Server that scraps NGINX vts stats and export them via HTTP
p5-Nginx-ReadBody-0.07_1       Nginx embeded perl module to read and evaluate a request body
p5-Nginx-Simple-0.07_1         Perl 5 module for easy to use interface for Nginx Perl Module
p5-Test-Nginx-0.30             Testing modules for Nginx C module development
py39-certbot-nginx-2.0.0       NGINX plugin for Certbot
rubygem-passenger-nginx-6.0.15 Modules for running Ruby on Rails and Rack applications
....

[[pkg-installing-fetching]]
=== Installing and Fetching Packages

To install a binary package man:pkg-install[8] can be used.
This command uses repository data to determine which version of the software to install and if it has any uninstalled dependencies.
For example, to install curl:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install curl
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
FreeBSD repository is up to date.
All repositories are up to date.
The following 9 package(s) will be affected (of 0 checked):

New packages to be INSTALLED:
        ca_root_nss: 3.83
        curl: 7.86.0
        gettext-runtime: 0.21
        indexinfo: 0.3.1
        libidn2: 2.3.3
        libnghttp2: 1.48.0
        libpsl: 0.21.1_4
        libssh2: 1.10.0.3
        libunistring: 1.0

Number of packages to be installed: 9

The process will require 11 MiB more space.
3 MiB to be downloaded

Proceed with this action? [y/N]
....

The new package and any additional packages that were installed as dependencies can be seen in the installed packages list:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg info
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
ca_root_nss-3.83               Root certificate bundle from the Mozilla Project
curl-7.86.0                    Command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
gettext-runtime-0.21.1         GNU gettext runtime libraries and programs
indexinfo-0.3.1                Utility to regenerate the GNU info page index
libidn2-2.3.3                  Implementation of IDNA2008 internationalized domain names
libnghttp2-1.48.0              HTTP/2.0 C Library
libpsl-0.21.1_6                C library to handle the Public Suffix List
libssh2-1.10.0.3               Library implementing the SSH2 protocol
libunistring-1.0               Unicode string library
pkg-1.18.4                     Package manager
....

To fetch a package and install it later or in another place use man:pkg-fetch[8].
For example, to download `nginx-lite`:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg fetch -d -o /usr/home/user/packages/ nginx-lite
....

* `-d`: used to fetch all the dependencies
* `-o`: used to specify the download directory

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
FreeBSD repository is up to date.
All repositories are up to date.
The following packages will be fetched:

New packages to be FETCHED:
        nginx-lite: 1.22.1,3 (342 KiB: 22.20% of the 2 MiB to download)
        pcre: 8.45_3 (1 MiB: 77.80% of the 2 MiB to download)

Number of packages to be fetched: 2

The process will require 2 MiB more space.
2 MiB to be downloaded.

Proceed with fetching packages? [y/N]:
....

To install the downloaded packages man:pkg-install[8] can be used as follows:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/home/user/packages/
....

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install nginx-lite-1.22.1,3.pkg
....

[[pkgng-pkg-info]]
=== Obtaining Information About Installed Packages

Information about the packages installed on a system can be viewed by running man:pkg-info[8] which, when run without any switches, will list the package version for either all installed packages or the specified package.

For example, to see which version of pkg is installed, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg info pkg
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....

[[pkgng-upgrading]]
=== Upgrading Installed Packages

Installed packages can be upgraded to their latest versions using man:pkg-upgrade[8]:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg upgrade
....

This command will compare the installed versions with those available in the repository catalogue and upgrade them from the repository.

[[pkgng-auditing]]
=== Auditing Installed Packages

Software vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in third-party applications.
To address this, pkg includes a built-in auditing mechanism.
To determine if there are any known vulnerabilities for the software installed on the system, use man:pkg-audit[8]:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg audit -F
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Fetching vuln.xml.xz: 100%  976 KiB 499.5kB/s    00:02    
chromium-108.0.5359.98 is vulnerable:
  chromium -- multiple vulnerabilities

  CVE: CVE-2022-4439
  CVE: CVE-2022-4438
  CVE: CVE-2022-4437
  CVE: CVE-2022-4436
  WWW: https://vuxml.FreeBSD.org/freebsd/83eb9374-7b97-11ed-be8f-3065ec8fd3ec.html
....

[[pkg-delete]]
=== Removing Packages

Packages that are no longer needed can be removed with man:pkg-delete[8].

For example:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg delete curl
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
Deinstallation has been requested for the following 1 packages (of 0 packages in the universe):

Installed packages to be REMOVED:
        curl :7.86.0

Number of packages to be removed: 1

The operation will free 4 MiB.

Proceed with deinstallation packages? [y/N]: y
[1/1] Deinstalling curl-7.86.0...
[1/1] Deleting files for curl-7.86.0: 100%
....

[[pkgng-autoremove]]
=== Automatically Removing Unused Packages

Removing a package may leave behind dependencies which are no longer required.
Unneeded packages that were installed as dependencies (leaf packages) can be automatically detected and removed using man:pkg-autoremove[8]:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg autoremove
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
Deinstallation has been requested for the following 1 packages:

Installed packages to be REMOVED:
        ca_root_nss-3.83

Number of packages to be removed: 1

The operation will free 723 KiB.

Proceed with deinstalling packages? [y/N]: 
....

Packages installed as dependencies are called _automatic_ packages.
Non-automatic packages, i.e the packages that were explicity installed not as a dependency to another package, can be listed using:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg prime-list
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
nginx
openvpn
sudo
....

`pkg prime-list` is an alias command declared in `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`.
There are many others that can be used to query the package database of the system.
For instance, command `pkg prime-origins` can be used to get the origin port directory of the list mentioned above:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg prime-origins
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
www/nginx
security/openvpn
security/sudo
....

This list can be used to rebuild all packages installed on a system using build tools such as package:ports-mgmt/poudriere[] or package:ports-mgmt/synth[].

Marking an installed package as automatic can be done using:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg set -A 1 devel/cmake
....

Once a package is a leaf package and is marked as automatic, it gets selected by `pkg autoremove`.

Marking an installed package as _not_ automatic can be done using:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg set -A 0 devel/cmake
....

[[pkgng-backup]]
=== Restoring the Package Database

Unlike the traditional package management system, pkg includes its own package database backup mechanism.
This functionality is enabled by default.

[TIP]
====
To disable the periodic script from backing up the package database, set `daily_backup_pkgdb_enable="NO"` in man:periodic.conf[5].
====

To restore the contents of a previous package database backup,
run the following command replacing _/path/to/pkg.sql_ with the location of the backup:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg backup -r /path/to/pkg.sql
....

[NOTE]
====
If restoring a backup taken by the periodic script, it must be decompressed prior to being restored.
====

To run a manual backup of the pkg database, run the following command,
replacing _/path/to/pkg.sql_ with a suitable file name and location:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg backup -d /path/to/pkg.sql
....

[[pkgng-clean]]
=== Removing Stale Packages

By default, pkg stores binary packages in a cache directory defined by `PKG_CACHEDIR` in man:pkg.conf[5].
Only copies of the latest installed packages are kept. Older versions of pkg kept all previous packages.
To remove these outdated binary packages, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg clean
....

The entire cache may be cleared by running:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg clean -a
....

[[pkg-locking-unlocking]]
=== Locking and Unlocking Packages

man:pkg-lock[8] is used to lock packages against reinstallation, modification or deletion.
man:pkg-unlock[8] unlocks the named packages.
Either variant only has an effect on currently installed packages.
Consequently it is impossible to block installation of a new package by using this mechanism, unless such an installation implies updating a locked package.

For example, to lock `nginx-lite`:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg lock nginx-lite
....

And to unlock `nginx-lite`:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg unlock nginx-lite
....

[[pkgng-set]]
=== Modifying Package Metadata

Software within the FreeBSD Ports Collection can undergo major version number changes.
To address this, pkg has a built-in command to update package origins.
This can be useful, for example, if package:lang/python3[] is renamed to package:lang/python311[] so that package:lang/python3[] can now represent version `3.11`.

To change the package origin for the above example, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg set -o lang/python3:lang/python311
....

As another example, to update package:lang/ruby31[] to package:lang/ruby32[], run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg set -o lang/ruby31:lang/ruby32
....

[NOTE]
====
When changing package origins, it is important to reinstall packages that are dependent on the package with the modified origin.
To force a reinstallation of dependent packages, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install -Rf lang/ruby32
....
====

[[ports-using]]
== Using the Ports Collection

The Ports Collection is a set of `Makefiles`, patches, and description files.
Each set of these files is used to compile and install an individual application on FreeBSD, and is called a _port_.

By default, the Ports Collection itself is stored as a subdirectory of `/usr/ports`.

[WARNING]
====
Before installing and using the Ports Collection, please be aware that it is generally ill-advised to use the Ports Collection in conjunction with the binary packages provided via pkg to install software.
pkg, by default, tracks quarterly branch-releases of the ports tree and not HEAD.
Dependencies could be different for a port in HEAD compared to its counterpart in a quarterly branch release and this could result in conflicts between dependencies installed by pkg and those from the Ports Collection.
If the Ports Collection and pkg must be used in conjunction, then be sure that your Ports Collection and pkg are on the same branch release of the ports tree.
====

The Ports Collection contains directories for software categories.
Inside each category are subdirectories for individual applications.
Each application subdirectory contains a set of files that tells FreeBSD how to compile and install that program, called a _ports skeleton_.
Each port skeleton includes these files and directories:

* *Makefile*: contains statements that specify how the application should be compiled and where its components should be installed.
* *distinfo*: contains the names and checksums of the files that must be downloaded to build the port.
* *files/*: this directory contains any patches needed for the program to compile and install on FreeBSD. This directory may also contain other files used to build the port.
* *pkg-descr*: provides a more detailed description of the program.
* *pkg-plist*: a list of all the files that will be installed by the port. It also tells the ports system which files to remove upon deinstallation.

Some ports include `pkg-message` or other files to handle special situations.
For more details on these files, and on ports in general, refer to the extref:{porters-handbook}[FreeBSD Porter's Handbook].

The port does not include the actual source code, also known as a `distfile`.
The extract portion of building a port will automatically save the downloaded source to `/usr/ports/distfiles`.

[[ports-using-installation-methods]]
=== Installing the Ports Collection

Before an application can be compiled using a port, the Ports Collection must first be installed.
If it was not installed during the installation of FreeBSD, use one of the following methods to install it:

[[ports-using-git-method]]
[.procedure]
****
*Procedure: Git Method*

If more control over the ports tree is needed or if local changes need to be maintained, or if running FreeBSD-CURRENT,
Git can be used to obtain the Ports Collection.
Refer to extref:{committers-guide}[the Git Primer, git-primer] for a detailed description of Git.

. Git must be installed before it can be used to check out the ports tree. If a copy of the ports tree is already present, install Git like this:
+
[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/devel/git
# make install clean
....
+
If the ports tree is not available, or pkg is being used to manage packages, Git can be installed as a package:
+
[source,shell]
....
# pkg install git
....
+
. Check out a copy of the HEAD branch of the ports tree:
+
[source,shell]
....
# git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git /usr/ports
....
+
. Or, check out a copy of a quarterly branch:
+
[source,shell]
....
# git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git -b 2020Q3 /usr/ports
....
+
. As needed, update `/usr/ports` after the initial Git checkout:
+
[source,shell]
....
# git -C /usr/ports pull
....
+
. As needed, switch `/usr/ports` to a different quarterly branch:
+
[source,shell]
....
# git -C /usr/ports switch 2020Q4
....
****

=== Installing Ports

This section provides basic instructions on using the Ports Collection to install or remove software.
The detailed description of available `make` targets and environment variables is available in man:ports[7].

[WARNING]
====

Before compiling any port, be sure to update the Ports Collection as described in the previous section.
Since the installation of any third-party software can introduce security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to first check https://vuxml.freebsd.org/[] for known security issues related to the port.
Alternatively, run `pkg audit -F` before installing a new port.
This command can be configured to automatically perform a security audit and an update of the vulnerability database during the daily security system check. For more information, refer to man:pkg-audit[8] and man:periodic[8].
====

Using the Ports Collection assumes a working Internet connection.
It also requires superuser privilege.

To compile and install the port, change to the directory of the port to be installed, then type `make install` at the prompt.
Messages will indicate the progress:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
# make install

===>  SECURITY NOTE:
      This port has installed the following binaries which execute with
      increased privileges.
/usr/local/sbin/lsof
#
....

Since `lsof` is a program that runs with increased privileges, a security warning is displayed as it is installed.
Once the installation is complete, the prompt will be returned.

Some shells keep a cache of the commands that are available in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable, to speed up lookup operations for the executable file of these commands.
Users of the `tcsh` shell should type `rehash` so that a newly installed command can be used without specifying its full path.
Use `hash -r` instead for the `sh` shell.
Refer to the documentation for the shell for more information.

During installation, a working subdirectory is created which contains all the temporary files used during compilation.
Removing this directory saves disk space and minimizes the chance of problems later when upgrading to the newer version of the port:

[source,shell]
....
# make clean
===>  Cleaning for lsof-88.d,8
#
....

[NOTE]
====
To save this extra step, instead use `make install clean` when compiling the port.
====

==== Customizing Ports Installation

Some ports provide build options which can be used to enable or disable application components, provide security options, or allow for other customizations.
Examples include package:www/firefox[] and package:security/gpgme[].
If the port depends upon other ports which have configurable options,
it may pause several times for user interaction as the default behavior is to prompt the user to select options from a menu.
To avoid this and do all of the configuration in one batch, run `make config-recursive` within the port skeleton.
Then, run `make install [clean]` to compile and install the port.

[TIP]
====
When using `config-recursive`, the list of ports to configure are gathered by the `all-depends-list` target.
It is recommended to run `make config-recursive` until all dependent ports options have been defined,
and ports options screens no longer appear, to be certain that all dependency options have been configured.
====

There are several ways to revisit a port's build options menu in order to add, remove, or change these options after a port has been built.
One method is to `cd` into the directory containing the port and type `make config`.
Another option is to use `make showconfig`.
Another option is to execute `make rmconfig` which will remove all selected options and allow you to start over.
All of these options, and others, are explained in great detail in man:ports[7].

The ports system uses man:fetch[1] to download the source files, which supports various environment variables.
The `FTP_PASSIVE_MODE`, `FTP_PROXY`, and `FTP_PASSWORD` variables may need to be set if the FreeBSD system is behind a firewall or FTP/HTTP proxy.
See man:fetch[3] for the complete list of supported variables.

For users who cannot be connected to the Internet all the time, `make fetch` can be run within `/usr/ports`,
to fetch all distfiles, or within a category, such as `/usr/ports/net`, or within the specific port skeleton.
Note that if a port has any dependencies, running this command in a category or ports skeleton will _not_ fetch the distfiles of ports from another category.
Instead, use `make fetch-recursive` to also fetch the distfiles for all the dependencies of a port.

In rare cases, such as when an organization has a local distfiles repository, the `MASTER_SITES` variable can be used to override the download locations specified in the `Makefile`.
When using, specify the alternate location:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/directory
# make MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE= \
ftp://ftp.organization.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/ fetch
....

The `WRKDIRPREFIX` and `PREFIX` variables can override the default working and target directories. For example:

[source,shell]
....
# make WRKDIRPREFIX=/usr/home/example/ports install
....

will compile the port in `/usr/home/example/ports` and install everything under `/usr/local`.

[source,shell]
....
# make PREFIX=/usr/home/example/local install
....

will compile the port in `/usr/ports` and install it in `/usr/home/example/local`. And:

[source,shell]
....
# make WRKDIRPREFIX=../ports PREFIX=../local install
....

will combine the two.

These can also be set as environmental variables.
Refer to the manual page for your shell for instructions on how to set an environmental variable.

[[ports-removing]]
=== Removing Installed Ports

Installed ports can be uninstalled using `pkg delete`.
Examples for using this command can be found in the man:pkg-delete[8] manual page.

Alternately, `make deinstall` can be run in the port\'s directory:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/lsof
# make deinstall
===>  Deinstalling for sysutils/lsof
===>   Deinstalling
Deinstallation has been requested for the following 1 packages:

	lsof-4.88.d,8

The deinstallation will free 229 kB
[1/1] Deleting lsof-4.88.d,8... done
....

It is recommended to read the messages as the port is uninstalled.
If the port has any applications that depend upon it, this information will be displayed but the uninstallation will proceed.
In such cases, it may be better to reinstall the application in order to prevent broken dependencies.

[[ports-upgrading]]
=== Upgrading Ports

Over time, newer versions of software become available in the Ports Collection.
This section describes how to determine which software can be upgraded and how to perform the upgrade.

To determine if newer versions of installed ports are available, ensure that the latest version of the ports tree is installed,
using the updating command described in <<ports-using-git-method, "Git Method">>.
The following command will list the installed ports which are out of date:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg version -l "<"
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before attempting an upgrade, read `/usr/ports/UPDATING` from the top of the file to the date closest to the last time ports were upgraded or the system was installed.
This file describes various issues and additional steps users may encounter and need to perform when updating a port, including such things as file format changes, changes in locations of configuration files, or any incompatibilities with previous versions.
Make note of any instructions which match any of the ports that need upgrading and follow these instructions when performing the upgrade.
====

[[ports-upgrading-tools]]
==== Tools to Upgrade and Manage Ports

The Ports Collection contains several utilities to perform the actual upgrade.
Each has its strengths and weaknesses.

Historically, most installations used either Portmaster or Portupgrade.
Synth is a newer alternative.

[NOTE]
====
The choice of which tool is best for a particular system is up to the system administrator.
It is recommended practice to back up your data before using any of these tools.
====

[[portmaster]]
==== Upgrading Ports Using Portmaster

package:ports-mgmt/portmaster[] is a very small utility for upgrading installed ports.
It is designed to use the tools installed with the FreeBSD base system without depending on other ports or databases.
To install this utility as a port:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster
# make install clean
....

Portmaster defines four categories of ports:

* Root port: has no dependencies and is not a dependency of any other ports.
* Trunk port: has no dependencies, but other ports depend upon it.
* Branch port: has dependencies and other ports depend upon it.
* Leaf port: has dependencies but no other ports depend upon it.

To list these categories and search for updates:

[source,shell]
....
# portmaster -L
===>>> Root ports (No dependencies, not depended on)
===>>> ispell-3.2.06_18
===>>> screen-4.0.3
        ===>>> New version available: screen-4.0.3_1
===>>> tcpflow-0.21_1
===>>> 7 root ports
...
===>>> Branch ports (Have dependencies, are depended on)
===>>> apache22-2.2.3
        ===>>> New version available: apache22-2.2.8
...
===>>> Leaf ports (Have dependencies, not depended on)
===>>> automake-1.9.6_2
===>>> bash-3.1.17
        ===>>> New version available: bash-3.2.33
...
===>>> 32 leaf ports

===>>> 137 total installed ports
        ===>>> 83 have new versions available
....

This command is used to upgrade all outdated ports:

[source,shell]
....
# portmaster -a
....

[NOTE]
====
By default, Portmaster makes a backup package before deleting the existing port.
If the installation of the new version is successful, Portmaster deletes the backup.
Using `-b` instructs Portmaster not to automatically delete the backup.
Adding `-i` starts Portmaster in interactive mode, prompting for confirmation before upgrading each port.
Many other options are available.
Read through the manual page for man:portmaster[8] for details regarding their usage.
====

If errors are encountered during the upgrade process, add `-f` to upgrade and rebuild all ports:

[source,shell]
....
# portmaster -af
....

Portmaster can also be used to install new ports on the system, upgrading all dependencies before building and installing the new port.
To use this function, specify the location of the port in the Ports Collection:

[source,shell]
....
# portmaster shells/bash
....

More information about package:ports-mgmt/portmaster[] may be found in its `pkg-descr`.

[[portupgrade]]
==== Upgrading Ports Using Portupgrade

package:ports-mgmt/portupgrade[] is another utility that can be used to upgrade ports.
It installs a suite of applications which can be used to manage ports.
However, it is dependent upon Ruby. To install the port:

[source,shell]
....
# cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade
# make install clean
....

Before performing an upgrade using this utility, it is recommended to scan the list of installed ports using `pkgdb -F` and to fix all the inconsistencies it reports.

To upgrade all the outdated ports installed on the system, use `portupgrade -a`.
Alternately, include `-i` to be asked for confirmation of every individual upgrade:

[source,shell]
....
# portupgrade -ai
....

To upgrade only a specified application instead of all available ports, use `portupgrade _pkgname_`.
It is very important to include `-R` to first upgrade all the ports required by the given application:

[source,shell]
....
# portupgrade -R firefox
....

If `-P` is included, Portupgrade searches for available packages in the local directories listed in `PKG_PATH`.
If none are available locally, it then fetches packages from a remote site.
If packages can not be found locally or fetched remotely, Portupgrade will use ports.
To avoid using ports entirely, specify `-PP`.
This last set of options tells Portupgrade to abort if no packages are available:

[source,shell]
....
# portupgrade -PP gnome3
....

To just fetch the port distfiles, or packages, if `-P` is specified, without building or installing anything, use `-F`.
For further information on all of the available switches, refer to the manual page for `portupgrade`.

More information about package:ports-mgmt/portupgrade[] may be found in its `pkg-descr`.

[[ports-disk-space]]
=== Ports and Disk Space

Using the Ports Collection will use up disk space over time.
After building and installing a port, running `make clean` within the ports skeleton will clean up the temporary `work` directory.
If Portmaster is used to install a port, it will automatically remove this directory unless `-K` is specified.
If Portupgrade is installed, this command will remove all `work` directories found within the local copy of the Ports Collection:

[source,shell]
....
# portsclean -C
....

In addition, outdated source distribution files accumulate in `/usr/ports/distfiles` over time.
To use Portupgrade to delete all the distfiles that are no longer referenced by any ports:

[source,shell]
....
# portsclean -D
....

Portupgrade can remove all distfiles not referenced by any port currently installed on the system:

[source,shell]
....
# portsclean -DD
....

If Portmaster is installed, use:

[source,shell]
....
# portmaster --clean-distfiles
....

By default, this command is interactive and prompts the user to confirm if a distfile should be deleted.

In addition to these commands, package:ports-mgmt/pkg_cutleaves[] automates the task of removing installed ports that are no longer needed.

[[ports-poudriere]]
== Building Packages with Poudriere

Poudriere is a `BSD`-licensed utility for creating and testing FreeBSD packages.
It uses FreeBSD jails to set up isolated compilation environments.
These jails can be used to build packages for versions of FreeBSD that are different from the system on which it is installed, and also to build packages for i386 if the host is an amd64 system.
Once the packages are built, they are in a layout identical to the official mirrors.
These packages are usable by man:pkg[8] and other package management tools.

Poudriere is installed using the package:ports-mgmt/poudriere[] package or port.
The installation includes a sample configuration file `/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf.sample`.
Copy this file to `/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf`.
Edit the copied file to suit the local configuration.

While `ZFS` is not required on the system running poudriere, it is beneficial.
When `ZFS` is used, `ZPOOL` must be specified in `/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf` and `FREEBSD_HOST` should be set to a nearby mirror.
Defining `CCACHE_DIR` enables the use of package:devel/ccache[] to cache compilation and reduce build times for frequently-compiled code.
It may be convenient to put poudriere datasets in an isolated tree mounted at `/poudriere`.
Defaults for the other configuration values are adequate.

The number of processor cores detected is used to define how many builds will run in parallel.
Supply enough virtual memory, either with `RAM` or swap space.
If virtual memory runs out, the compilation jails will stop and be torn down, resulting in weird error messages.

[[poudriere-initialization]]
=== Initialize Jails and Port Trees

After configuration, initialize poudriere so that it installs a jail with the required FreeBSD tree and a ports tree.
Specify a name for the jail using `-j` and the FreeBSD version with `-v`.
On systems running FreeBSD/amd64, the architecture can be set with `-a` to either `i386` or `amd64`.
The default is the architecture shown by `uname`.

[source,shell]

On a single computer, poudriere can build ports with multiple configurations, in multiple jails, and from different port trees.
Custom configurations for these combinations are called _sets_.
See the CUSTOMIZATION section of man:poudriere[8] for details after package:ports-mgmt/poudriere[] or package:ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel[] is installed.

The basic configuration shown here puts a single jail-, port-, and set-specific `make.conf` in `/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d`.
The filename in this example is created by combining the jail name, port name, and set name: `13amd64-local-workstation-make.conf`.
The system `make.conf` and this new file are combined at build time to create the `make.conf` used by the build jail.

Packages to be built are entered in `13amd64-local-workstation-pkglist`:

[.programlisting]
....
editors/emacs
devel/git
ports-mgmt/pkg
...
....

Options and dependencies for the specified ports are configured:

[source,shell]
....
# poudriere options -j 13amd64 -p local -z workstation -f 13amd64-local-workstation-pkglist
....

Finally, packages are built and a package repository is created:

[source,shell]
....
# poudriere bulk -j 13amd64 -p local -z workstation -f 13amd64-local-workstation-pkglist
....

While running, pressing kbd:[Ctrl+t] displays the current state of the build.
Poudriere also builds files in `/poudriere/logs/bulk/jailname` that can be used with a web server to display build information.

After completion, the new packages are now available for installation from the poudriere repository.

For more information on using poudriere, see man:poudriere[8] and the main web site, https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/wiki[].

=== Configuring pkg Clients to Use a Poudriere Repository

While it is possible to use both a custom repository along side of the official repository, sometimes it is useful to disable the official repository.
This is done by creating a configuration file that overrides and disables the official configuration file.
Create `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf` that contains the following:

[.programlisting]
....
FreeBSD: {
	enabled: no
}
....

Usually it is easiest to serve a poudriere repository to the client machines via HTTP.
Set up a webserver to serve up the package directory, for instance: `/usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/13amd64`, where `13amd64` is the name of the build.

If the URL to the package repository is: `http://pkg.example.com/13amd64`,
then the repository configuration file in `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/custom.conf` would look like:

[.programlisting]
....
custom: {
	url: "http://pkg.example.com/13amd64",
	enabled: yes,
}
....

[[ports-nextsteps]]
== Post-Installation Considerations

Regardless of whether the software was installed from a binary package or port, most third-party applications require some level of configuration after installation.
The following commands and locations can be used to help determine what was installed with the application.

* Most applications install at least one default configuration file in `/usr/local/etc`. In cases where an application has a large number of configuration files, a subdirectory will be created to hold them. Often, sample configuration files are installed which end with a suffix such as `.sample`. The configuration files should be reviewed and possibly edited to meet the system's needs. To edit a sample file, first copy it without the `.sample` extension.
* Applications which provide documentation will install it into `/usr/local/share/doc` and many applications also install manual pages. This documentation should be consulted before continuing.
* Some applications run services which must be added to `/etc/rc.conf` before starting the application. These applications usually install a startup script in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d`. See crossref:config[configtuning-starting-services,Starting Services] for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
By design, applications do not run their startup script upon installation, nor do they run their stop script upon deinstallation or upgrade.
This decision is left to the individual system administrator.
====

* Users of man:csh[1] should run `rehash` to rebuild the known binary list in the shells `PATH`.
* Use `pkg info` to determine which files, man pages, and binaries were installed with the application.

[[ports-broken]]
== Dealing with Broken Ports

When a port does not build or install, try the following:

. Search to see if there is a fix pending for the port in the link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/support/[Problem Report database]. If so, implementing the proposed fix may fix the issue.
. Ask the maintainer of the port for help. Type `make maintainer` in the ports skeleton or read the port's `Makefile` to find the maintainer's email address. Remember to include the output leading up to the error in the email to the maintainer.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some ports are not maintained by an individual but instead by a group maintainer represented by a extref:{mailing-list-faq}[mailing list].
Many, but not all, of these addresses look like mailto:freebsd-listname@FreeBSD.org[freebsd-listname@FreeBSD.org].
Please take this into account when sending an email.

In particular, ports maintained by mailto:ports@FreeBSD.org[ports@FreeBSD.org] are not maintained by a specific individual.
Instead, any fixes and support come from the general community who subscribe to that mailing list. More volunteers are always needed!
====
+
If there is no response to the email, use Bugzilla to submit a bug report using the instructions in extref:{problem-reports}[Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports].
. Fix it! The extref:{porters-handbook}[Porter's Handbook] includes detailed information on the ports infrastructure so that you can fix the occasional broken port or even submit your own!
. Install the package instead of the port using the instructions in <<pkgng-intro>>.

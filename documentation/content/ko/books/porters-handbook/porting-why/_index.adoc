The FreeBSD Ports Collection is the way almost everyone installs applications ("ports") on FreeBSD.
Like everything else about FreeBSD, it is primarily a volunteer effort.
It is important to keep this in mind when reading this document.

In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer to maintain an existing unmaintained port.
No special commit privilege is needed.

"The development of FreeBSD is a very open process.  FreeBSD is comprised of "
"contributions from thousands of people around the world.  The FreeBSD "
"Project provides Subversion footnote:[Subversion, http://subversion.apache."
"org] access to the general public so that others can have access to log "
"messages, diffs (patches) between development branches, and other "
"productivity enhancements that formal source code management provides.  This "
"has been a huge help in attracting more talented developers to FreeBSD.  "
"However, I think everyone would agree that chaos would soon manifest if "
"write access to the main repository was opened up to everyone on the "
"Internet.  Therefore only a \"select\" group of nearly 300 people are given "
"write access to the Subversion repository.  These extref:{contributors}"

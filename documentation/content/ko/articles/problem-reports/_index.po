"There are many types of problems, and not all of them should engender a "
"problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and there will be times when "
"what seems to be a bug in a program is, in fact, a misunderstanding of the "
"syntax for a command or a typographical error in a configuration file "
"(though that in itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or "
"poor error handling in the application).  There are still many cases where "
"submitting a problem report is clearly _not_ the right course of action, and "
"will only serve to frustrate both the submitter and the developers.  "
"Conversely, there are cases where it might be appropriate to submit a "
"problem report about something else than a bug-an enhancement or a new "
"feature, for instance."

"So how does one determine what is a bug and what is not? As a simple rule of "
"thumb, the problem is _not_ a bug if it can be expressed as a question "
"(usually of the form \"How do I do X?\" or \"Where can I find Y?\").  It is "
"not always quite so black and white, but the question rule covers a large "
"majority of cases.  When looking for an answer, consider posing the question "

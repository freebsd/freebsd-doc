"The different partition sizes can be set through the use of `NANO_CODESIZE`, "

"`NANO_CODESIZE` defines the size of the first two image partitions: `code#1` "
"and `code#2`. They have to be big enough to hold all the files that will be "
"produced as a result of the `buildworld` and `buildkernel` processes. "
"`NANO_CONFSIZE` defines the size of the configuration file partition, so it "
"does not need to be very big; but do not make it so small that it will not "
"hold all configuration files. Finally, `NANO_DATASIZE` defines the size of "
"an optional partition, that can be used on the appliance. The last partition "

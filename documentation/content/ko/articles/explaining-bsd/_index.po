"themselves were allowed to sell UNIX(R) commercially, they started with a "
"somewhat bare-bones implementation called System III, to be quickly followed "

"The BSD tapes contained AT&T source code and thus required a UNIX(R) source "

"closure.  Some members of the group decided to release the BSD code, which "
"was Open Source, without the AT&T proprietary code.  This finally happened "
"with the __Networking Tape 2__, usually known as __Net/2__.  Net/2 was not a "
"complete operating system: about 20% of the kernel code was missing.  One of "
"the CSRG members, William F. Jolitz, wrote the remaining code and released "
"it in early 1992 as __386BSD__.  At the same time, another group of ex-CSRG "
"members formed a commercial company called http://www.bsdi.com/[Berkeley "

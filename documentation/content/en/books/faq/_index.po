"The total address space on i386(TM) machines is 32-bit, meaning that at most "
"4 GB of memory is addressable (can be accessed).  Furthermore, some "
"addresses in this range are reserved by hardware for different purposes, for "
"example for using and controlling PCI devices, for accessing video memory, "
"and so on.  Therefore, the total amount of memory usable by the operating "

"To access more than 3.2 GB to 3.7 GB of installed memory (meaning up to 4 GB "

"be overlaid by address reservations for hardware devices above the 4 GB "

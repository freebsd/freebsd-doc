"FreeBSD crash dumps are usually the same size as physical RAM.  Therefore, "
"make sure there is enough space in [.filename]#/var/crash# to hold the "
"dump.  Alternatively, run man:savecore[8] manually and have it recover the "
"crash dump to another directory with more room.  It is possible to limit the "
"size of the crash dump by using `options MAXMEM=N` where _N_ is the size of "
"kernel's memory usage in KBs.  For example, for 1 GB of RAM, limit the "
"kernel's memory usage to 128 MB, so that the crash dump size will be 128 MB "
"instead of 1 GB."

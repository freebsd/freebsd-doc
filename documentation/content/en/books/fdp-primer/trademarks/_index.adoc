For all documents on the FreeBSD Documentation Project, it is necessary to cite registered trademarks, and that is a duty of every writer and contributor.

[[trademark-symbols]]
== Trademark Symbols

Add a registered trademark symbol (TM), (R), or other symbols in the first occurrence of the company or software name, and always when using logos.
Also, write the company or software name following its trademark guidelines.

When in doubt, research the company on the Internet or the software's website in addition to the link:https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks[United States Patent and Trademark Office site].

[[trademark-citing]]
== Trademark Citing

It is customary to cite trademarks in technical documentation, and the FreeBSD Documentation Project provides a template for it, which also avoids duplicating trademarks in the documents.

First, check the project's link:https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/tree/documentation/themes/beastie/i18n/en.toml#n197[template] for the trademark and then add it to the trademarks tag on the `Front Matter` section of the document, placed at the beginning of each document.

The following is an example of the `Front Matter` of the extref:{contributing}[Contributing to FreeBSD] article:

....

title: Contributing to FreeBSD
authors:
  - author: Jordan Hubbard
  - author: Sam Lawrance
  - author: Mark Linimon
description: How to contribute to the FreeBSD Project
trademarks: ["freebsd", "ieee", "general"]
weight: 15
tags: ["Contributing", "FreeBSD", "Non-Programmer Tasks", "Programmer Tasks"]
---
....

The trademark tags `freebsd`, `ieee`, and `general` will be automatically rendered when building the document like this:

....
FreeBSD is a registered trademark of the FreeBSD Foundation.

IEEE, POSIX, and 802 are registered trademarks of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. in the United States.

Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks. Where those designations appear in this document, and the FreeBSD Project was aware of the trademark claim, the designations have been followed by the “™” or the “®” symbol.
....

If a trademark is not present in the project's template, it must be submitted.
Any developer or contributor can update the trademarks.

The `freebsd` and `general` trademark tags are usually present in all documents.

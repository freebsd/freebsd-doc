"On most UNIX(R) systems, `root` has omnipotent power. This promotes "
"insecurity. If an attacker gained `root` on a system, he would have every "
"function at his fingertips. In FreeBSD there are sysctls which dilute the "
"power of `root`, in order to minimize the damage caused by an attacker. "
"Specifically, one of these functions is called `secure levels`. Similarly, "
"another function which is present from FreeBSD 4.0 and onward, is a utility "
"called man:jail[8]. Jail chroots an environment and sets certain "
"restrictions on processes which are forked within the jail. For example, a "
"jailed process cannot affect processes outside the jail, utilize certain "
"system calls, or inflict any damage on the host environment."

"System V IPC is based on messages. Processes can send each other these "
"messages which tell them how to act. The functions which deal with messages "
"are: man:msgctl[3], man:msgget[3], man:msgsnd[3] and man:msgrcv[3]. Earlier, "
"I mentioned that there were certain sysctls you could turn on or off in "
"order to affect the behavior of jail. One of these sysctls was "
"`security.jail.sysvipc_allowed`. By default, this sysctl is set to 0. If it "
"were set to 1, it would defeat the whole purpose of having a jail; "
"privileged users from the jail would be able to affect processes outside the "
"jailed environment. The difference between a message and a signal is that "
"the message only consists of the signal number."

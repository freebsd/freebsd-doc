"PC Cards are identified in one of two ways, both based on the _Card "
"Information Structure_ (CIS) stored on the card. The first method is to use "
"numeric manufacturer and product numbers. The second method is to use the "
"human readable strings that are also contained in the CIS. The PC Card bus "
"uses a centralized database and some macros to facilitate a design pattern "
"to help the driver writer match devices to his driver."

"Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often develop a reference design for "
"a PC Card product, then sell this design to other companies to market. Those "
"companies refine the design, market the product to their target audience or "
"geographic area, and put their own name plate onto the card. The refinements "
"to the physical card are typically very minor, if any changes are made at "
"all. To strengthen their brand, these vendors place their company name in "
"the human readable strings in the CIS space, but leave the manufacturer and "
"product IDs unchanged."

"Due to this practice, FreeBSD drivers usually rely on numeric IDs for device "
"identification. Using numeric IDs and a centralized database complicates "
"adding IDs and support for cards to the system. One must carefully check to "
"see who really made the card, especially when it appears that the vendor who "
"made the card might already have a different manufacturer ID listed in the "
"central database. Linksys, D-Link, and NetGear are a number of US "
"manufacturers of LAN hardware that often sell the same design. These same "
"designs can be sold in Japan under names such as Buffalo and Corega. Often, "
"these devices will all have the same manufacturer and product IDs."

"Finally, some really low end devices do not contain manufacturer "

"as a fallback, it is necessary for some very low end CD-ROM players and "
"Ethernet cards. This method should generally be avoided, but a number of "
"devices are listed in this section because they were added prior to the "
"recognition of the OEM nature of the PC Card business. When adding new "

"NETGEAR purchased cards from and the author of support for those cards was "

"identifies the manufacturer. Do not add IDs of the form `0xffffffff` or "
"`0xffff` because these are reserved IDs (the former is \"no ID set\" while "

"The familiar `product` keyword is followed by the vendor name and the card "

"a real space. NULL strings mean that the corresponding part of the entry "
"should be ignored. The example shown here contains a bad entry. It should "
"not contain the version number unless that is critical for the operation of "
"the card. Sometimes vendors will have many different versions of the card in "
"the field that all work, in which case that information only makes it harder "
"for someone with a similar card to use it with FreeBSD. Sometimes it is "
"necessary when a vendor wishes to sell many different parts under the same "
"brand due to market considerations (availability, price, and so forth). Then "
"it can be critical to disambiguating the card in those rare cases where the "
"vendor kept the same manufacturer/product pair. Regular expression matching "

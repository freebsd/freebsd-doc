"SYSINIT is the framework for a generic call sort and dispatch mechanism. "
"FreeBSD currently uses it for the dynamic initialization of the kernel. "
"SYSINIT allows FreeBSD's kernel subsystems to be reordered, and added, "
"removed, and replaced at kernel link time when the kernel or one of its "
"modules is loaded without having to edit a statically ordered initialization "
"routing and recompile the kernel. This system also allows kernel modules, "
"currently called _KLD's_, to be separately compiled, linked, and initialized "
"at boot time and loaded even later while the system is already running. This "
"is accomplished using the \"kernel linker\" and \"linker sets\"."

"SYSINIT relies on the ability of the linker to take static data declared at "
"multiple locations throughout a program's source and group it together as a "
"single contiguous chunk of data. This linker technique is called a \"linker "
"set\". SYSINIT uses two linker sets to maintain two data sets containing "
"each consumer's call order, function, and a pointer to the data to pass to "
"that function."

"SYSINIT uses two priorities when ordering the functions for execution. The "
"first priority is a subsystem ID giving an overall order for SYSINIT's "
"dispatch of functions. Current predeclared ID's are in [.filename]#<sys/"
"kernel.h># in the enum list `sysinit_sub_id`. The second priority used is an "
"element order within the subsystem. Current predeclared subsystem element "
"orders are in [.filename]#<sys/kernel.h># in the enum list "

"There are currently two uses for SYSINIT. Function dispatch at system "
"startup and kernel module loads, and function dispatch at system shutdown "
"and kernel module unload. Kernel subsystems often use system startup "
"SYSINIT's to initialize data structures, for example the process scheduling "
"subsystem uses a SYSINIT to initialize the run queue data structure. Device "
"drivers should avoid using `SYSINIT()` directly. Instead drivers for real "
"devices that are part of a bus structure should use `DRIVER_MODULE()` to "
"provide a function that detects the device and, if it is present, "
"initializes the device. It will do a few things specific to devices and then "
"call `SYSINIT()` itself. For pseudo-devices, which are not part of a bus "
"structure, use `DEV_MODULE()`."

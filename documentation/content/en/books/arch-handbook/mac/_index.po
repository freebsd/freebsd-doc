"Mandatory Access Control (MAC), refers to a set of access control policies "
"that are mandatorily enforced on users by the operating system.  MAC "
"policies may be contrasted with Discretionary Access Control (DAC) "
"protections, by which non-administrative users may (at their discretion) "
"protect objects.  In traditional UNIX systems, DAC protections include file "
"permissions and access control lists; MAC protections include process "
"controls preventing inter-user debugging and firewalls.  A variety of MAC "
"policies have been formulated by operating system designers and security "
"researches, including the Multi-Level Security (MLS) confidentiality policy, "
"the Biba integrity policy, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Domain and Type "
"Enforcement (DTE), and Type Enforcement (TE).  Each model bases decisions on "
"a variety of factors, including user identity, role, and security clearance, "

"This entry point permits policy modules to perform MAC-related events when a "

"in the stack during system call processing; process labels might represent "
"traditional authentication data, process history information, or other "
"data.  To employ this mechanism, intended changes to the process credential "
"label may be stored in the `p_label` protected by a per-policy spin lock, "
"and then set the per-thread `TDF_ASTPENDING` flag and per-process "
"`PS_MACPENDM` flag to schedule a call to the `userret` entry point.  From "
"this entry point, the policy may create a replacement credential with less "
"concern about the locking context.  Policy writers are cautioned that event "
"ordering relating to scheduling an AST and the AST being performed may be "
"complex and interlaced in multithreaded applications."

"Label creation occurs when the kernel structure is associated with an actual "
"kernel object.  For example, Mbufs may be allocated and remain unused in a "
"pool until they are required.  mbuf allocation causes label initialization "
"on the mbuf to take place, but mbuf creation occurs when the mbuf is "
"associated with a datagram.  Typically, context will be provided for a "
"creation event, including the circumstances of the creation, and labels of "
"other relevant objects in the creation process.  For example, when an mbuf "
"is created from a socket, the socket and its label will be presented to "
"registered policies in addition to the new mbuf and its label.  Memory "
"allocation in creation events is discouraged, as it may occur in performance "
"sensitive ports of the kernel; in addition, creation calls are not permitted "
"to fail so a failure to allocate memory cannot be reported."

"Object specific events do not generally fall into the other broad classes of "

"entry point as a result of the acceptance of an additional mbuf to that "

"return and set labels on processes and objects (`mac_t`), and externalized "
"form based on C strings appropriate for storage in configuration files, "
"display to the user, or input from the user.  Each MAC label contains a "
"number of elements, each consisting of a name and value pair.  Policy "
"modules in the kernel bind to specific names and interpret the values in "
"policy-specific ways.  In the externalized string form, labels are "
"represented by a comma-delimited list of name and value pairs separated by "
"the `/` character.  Labels may be directly converted to and from text using "
"provided APIs; when retrieving labels from the kernel, internalized label "
"storage must first be prepared for the desired label element set.  "
"Typically, this is done in one of two ways: using man:mac_prepare[3] and an "
"arbitrary list of desired label elements, or one of the variants of the call "
"that loads a default element set from the man:mac.conf[5] configuration "
"file.  Per-object defaults permit application writers to usefully display "
"labels associated with objects without being aware of the policies present "

"Currently, direct manipulation of label elements other than by conversion to "
"a text string, string editing, and conversion back to an internalized label "
"is not supported by the MAC library.  Such interfaces may be added in the "

"The standard user context management interface, man:setusercontext[3], has "
"been modified to retrieve MAC labels associated with a user's class from man:"
"login.conf[5].  These labels are then set along with other user context when "
"either `LOGIN_SETALL` is specified, or when `LOGIN_SETMAC` is explicitly "
"specified."

"The TrustedBSD MAC framework permits kernel modules to augment the system "
"security policy in a highly integrated manner.  They may do this based on "
"existing object properties, or based on label data that is maintained with "
"the assistance of the MAC framework.  The framework is sufficiently flexible "
"to implement a variety of policy types, including information flow security "
"policies such as MLS and Biba, as well as policies based on existing BSD "
"credentials or file protections.  Policy authors may wish to consult this "
"documentation as well as existing security modules when implementing a new "
"security service."

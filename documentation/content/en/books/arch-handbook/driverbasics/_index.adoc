[[driverbasics-intro]]
== Introduction

This chapter provides a brief introduction to writing device drivers for FreeBSD. A device in this context is a term used mostly for hardware-related stuff that belongs to the system, like disks, printers, or a graphics display with its keyboard. A device driver is the software component of the operating system that controls a specific device. There are also so-called pseudo-devices where a device driver emulates the behavior of a device in software without any particular underlying hardware. Device drivers can be compiled into the system statically or loaded on demand through the dynamic kernel linker facility `kld'.

Most devices in a UNIX(R)-like operating system are accessed through device-nodes, sometimes also called special files. These files are usually located under the directory [.filename]#/dev# in the filesystem hierarchy.

Device drivers can roughly be broken down into two categories; character and network device drivers.

[[driverbasics-kld]]
== Dynamic Kernel Linker Facility - KLD

The kld interface allows system administrators to dynamically add and remove functionality from a running system. This allows device driver writers to load their new changes into a running kernel without constantly rebooting to test changes.

The kld interface is used through:

* `kldload` - loads a new kernel module
* `kldunload` - unloads a kernel module
* `kldstat` - lists loaded modules

#include <sys/systm.h>  /* uprintf */
#include <sys/errno.h>
#include <sys/param.h>  /* defines used in kernel.h */
#include <sys/module.h>
#include <sys/kernel.h> /* types used in module initialization */

/*
 * Load handler that deals with the loading and unloading of a KLD.
 */

static int
skel_loader(struct module *m, int what, void *arg)
{
  int err = 0;

  switch (what) {
  case MOD_LOAD:                /* kldload */
    uprintf("Skeleton KLD loaded.\n");
    break;
  case MOD_UNLOAD:
    uprintf("Skeleton KLD unloaded.\n");
    break;
  default:
    err = EOPNOTSUPP;
    break;
  }
  return(err);
}

/* Declare this module to the rest of the kernel */

static moduledata_t skel_mod = {
  "skel",
  skel_loader,
  NULL
};

DECLARE_MODULE(skeleton, skel_mod, SI_SUB_KLD, SI_ORDER_ANY);
....

=== Makefile

FreeBSD provides a system makefile to simplify compiling a kernel module.

[.programlisting]
....
SRCS=skeleton.c
KMOD=skeleton

.include <bsd.kmod.mk>
....

Running `make` with this makefile will create a file [.filename]#skeleton.ko# that can be loaded into the kernel by typing:

[source,bash]
....
# kldload -v ./skeleton.ko
....

[[driverbasics-char]]
== Character Devices

A character device driver is one that transfers data directly to and from a user process. This is the most common type of device driver and there are plenty of simple examples in the source tree.

This simple example pseudo-device remembers whatever values are written to it and can then echo them back when read.

[[driverbasics-block]]
== Block Devices (Are Gone)

Other UNIX(R) systems may support a second type of disk device known as block devices. Block devices are disk devices for which the kernel provides caching. This caching makes block-devices almost unusable, or at least dangerously unreliable. The caching will reorder the sequence of write operations, depriving the application of the ability to know the exact disk contents at any one instant in time.

This makes predictable and reliable crash recovery of on-disk data structures (filesystems, databases, etc.) impossible. Since writes may be delayed, there is no way the kernel can report to the application which particular write operation encountered a write error, this further compounds the consistency problem.

For this reason, no serious applications rely on block devices, and in fact, almost all applications which access disks directly take great pains to specify that character (or "raw") devices should always be used. As the implementation of the aliasing of each disk (partition) to two devices with different semantics significantly complicated the relevant kernel code, FreeBSD dropped support for cached disk devices as part of the modernization of the disk I/O infrastructure.

[[driverbasics-net]]
== Network Drivers

Drivers for network devices do not use device nodes in order to be accessed. Their selection is based on other decisions made inside the kernel and instead of calling open(), use of a network device is generally introduced by using the system call socket(2).

For more information see ifnet(9), the source of the loopback device, and Bill Paul's network drivers.

"This chapter is an overview of the boot and system initialization processes, "
"starting from the BIOS (firmware) POST, to the first user process creation.  "
"Since the initial steps of system startup are very architecture dependent, "
"the IA-32 architecture is used as an example.  But the AMD64 and ARM64 "
"architectures are much more important and compelling examples and should be "
"explained in the near future according to the topic of this document."

"The FreeBSD boot process can be surprisingly complex.  After control is "
"passed from the BIOS, a considerable amount of low-level configuration must "
"be done before the kernel can be loaded and executed.  This setup must be "

"The boot process is an extremely machine-dependent activity.  Not only must "
"code be written for every computer architecture, but there may also be "
"multiple types of booting on the same architecture.  For example, a "
"directory listing of [.filename]#stand# reveals a great amount of "
"architecture-dependent code.  There is a directory for each of the various "
"supported architectures.  FreeBSD supports the CSM boot standard "
"(Compatibility Support Module).  So CSM is supported (with both GPT and MBR "
"partitioning support) and UEFI booting (GPT is totally supported, MBR is "
"mostly supported).  It also supports loading files from ext2fs, MSDOS, UFS "
"and ZFS.  FreeBSD also supports the boot environment feature of ZFS which "
"allows the HOST OS to communicate details about what to boot that go beyond "
"a simple partition as was possible in the past.  But UEFI is more relevant "
"than the CSM these days.  The example that follows shows booting an x86 "
"computer from an MBR-partitioned hard drive with the FreeBSD "
"[.filename]#boot0# multi-boot loader stored in the very first sector.  That "
"boot code starts the FreeBSD three-stage boot process."

"The key to understanding this process is that it is a series of stages of "

"[.filename]#boot2#, and [.filename]#loader# (see man:boot[8] for more "
"detail).  The boot system executes each stage in sequence.  The last stage, "
"[.filename]#loader#, is responsible for loading the FreeBSD kernel.  Each "
"stage is examined in the following sections."

"When the computer powers on, the processor's registers are set to some "

"register, and its value after a power on is well defined: it is a 32-bit "
"value of `0xfffffff0`.  The instruction pointer register (also known as the "
"Program Counter) points to code to be executed by the processor.  Another "
"important register is the `cr0` 32-bit control register, and its value just "
"after a reboot is `0`.  One of ``cr0``'s bits, the PE (Protection Enabled) "
"bit, indicates whether the processor is running in 32-bit protected mode or "
"16-bit real mode.  Since this bit is cleared at boot time, the processor "
"boots in 16-bit real mode.  Real mode means, among other things, that linear "
"and physical addresses are identical.  The reason for the processor not to "
"start immediately in 32-bit protected mode is backwards compatibility.  In "
"particular, the boot process relies on the services provided by the BIOS, "

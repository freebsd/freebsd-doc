"FreeBSD offers an excellent development environment.  Compilers for C and C+"
"+ and an assembler come with the basic system, not to mention classic "
"UNIX(R) tools such as `sed` and `awk`.  If that is not enough, there are "
"many more compilers and interpreters in the Ports collection.  The following "
"section, crossref:tools[tools-programming,Introduction to Programming], "
"lists some of the available options.  FreeBSD is very compatible with "
"standards such as POSIX(R) and ANSI C, as well with its own BSD heritage, so "
"it is possible to write applications that will compile and run with little "
"or no modification on a wide range of platforms."

"A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer to do various "
"things; sometimes the instruction it has to perform depends on what happened "
"when it performed a previous instruction.  This section gives an overview of "
"the two main ways in which you can give these instructions, or \"commands\" "
"as they are usually called.  One way uses an _interpreter_, the other a "
"_compiler_.  As human languages are too difficult for a computer to "
"understand in an unambiguous way, commands are usually written in one or "
"other languages specially designed for the purpose."

"With an interpreter, the language comes as an environment, where you type in "
"commands at a prompt and the environment executes them for you.  For more "
"complicated programs, you can type the commands into a file and get the "
"interpreter to load the file and execute the commands in it.  If anything "

"track down the problem."

"The advantage of this is that you can see the results of your commands "
"immediately, and mistakes can be corrected readily.  The biggest "
"disadvantage comes when you want to share your programs with someone.  They "
"must have the same interpreter, or you must have some way of giving it to "
"them, and they need to understand how to use it.  Also users may not "
"appreciate being thrown into a debugger if they press the wrong key! From a "
"performance point of view, interpreters can use up a lot of memory, and "
"generally do not generate code as efficiently as compilers."

"In my opinion, interpreted languages are the best way to start if you have "
"not done any programming before.  This kind of environment is typically "
"found with languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl and Basic.  It could also be "
"argued that the UNIX(R) shell (`sh`, `csh`) is itself an interpreter, and "
"many people do in fact write shell \"scripts\" to help with various "
"\"housekeeping\" tasks on their machine.  Indeed, part of the original "
"UNIX(R) philosophy was to provide lots of small utility programs that could "
"be linked together in shell scripts to perform useful tasks."

"Emacs already has a pre-defined function called `next-error`. In a "
"compilation output window, this allows you to move from one compilation "
"error to the next by doing `M-n`; we define a complementary function, "
"`previous-error`, that allows you to go to a previous error by doing `M-p`. "
"The nicest feature of all is that `C-c C-c` will open up the source file in "
"which the error occurred and jump to the appropriate line."

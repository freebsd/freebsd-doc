"Most modern computer systems use a stack to pass arguments to procedures and "
"to store local variables.  A stack is a last in first out (LIFO) buffer in "
"the high memory area of a process image.  When a program invokes a function "
"a new \"stack frame\" is created.  This stack frame consists of the "
"arguments passed to the function as well as a dynamic amount of local "
"variable space.  The \"stack pointer\" is a register that holds the current "
"location of the top of the stack.  Since this value is constantly changing "
"as new values are pushed onto the top of the stack, many implementations "
"also provide a \"frame pointer\" that is located near the beginning of a "
"stack frame so that local variables can more easily be addressed relative to "
"this value.  crossref:bibliography[cod,1] The return address for function "
"calls is also stored on the stack, and this is the cause of stack-overflow "
"exploits since overflowing a local variable in a function can overwrite the "
"return address of that function, potentially allowing a malicious user to "
"execute any code he or she wants."

"The most straightforward solution to the problem of stack-overflows is to "

"size of the input buffer is as large as the destination.  The length "
"parameter is also used inconsistently between strncpy and strncat so it is "
"easy for programmers to get confused as to their proper usage.  There is "

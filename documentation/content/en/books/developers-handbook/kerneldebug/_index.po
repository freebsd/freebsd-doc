"device (the recommended way to extract a kernel dump) or `AUTO` to use the "
"first configured swap device.  The default for `dumpdev` is `AUTO` in HEAD, "
"and changed to `NO` on RELENG_* branches (except for RELENG_7, which was "
"left set to `AUTO`).  On FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE and later versions, bsdinstall "

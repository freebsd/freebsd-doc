"This means that a port must not install files directly to the regular "
"destination directories (that is, under `PREFIX`, for example) but instead "
"into a separate directory from which the package is then built.  In many "
"cases, this does not require root privileges, making it possible to build "
"packages as an unprivileged user.  With staging, the port is built and "
"installed into the stage directory, `STAGEDIR`.  A package is created from "
"the stage directory and then installed on the system. Automake tools refer "
"to this concept as `DESTDIR`, but in FreeBSD, `DESTDIR` has a different "
"meaning (see crossref:testing[porting-prefix,`PREFIX` and `DESTDIR`])."

This section describes how to quickly create a new port.
For applications where this quick method is not adequate, the full "Slow Porting" process is described in crossref:slow-porting[slow-porting,Slow Porting].

First, get the original tarball and put it into `DISTDIR`, which defaults to [.filename]#/usr/ports/distfiles#.

[NOTE]
====
These steps assume that the software compiled out-of-the-box.
In other words, absolutely no changes were required for the application to work on a FreeBSD system.
If anything had to be changed, refer to crossref:slow-porting[slow-porting,Slow Porting].
====

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to set the `DEVELOPER` man:make[1] variable in [.filename]#/etc/make.conf# before getting into porting.

[source,shell]
....
# echo DEVELOPER=yes >> /etc/make.conf
....

This setting enables the "developer mode" that displays deprecation warnings and activates some further quality checks on calling `make`.
====

[[porting-makefile]]
== Writing the Makefile

The minimal [.filename]#Makefile# would look something like this:

[.programlisting]
....
PORTNAME=	oneko
DISTVERSION=	1.1b
CATEGORIES=	games
MASTER_SITES=	ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/X11R5/contrib/

MAINTAINER=	youremail@example.com
COMMENT=	Cat chasing a mouse all over the screen
WWW=		http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/

.include <bsd.port.mk>
....

Try to figure it out.
A more detailed example is shown in the crossref:porting-samplem[porting-samplem,sample Makefile] section.

[[porting-desc]]
== Writing the Description Files

There are two description files that are required for any port, whether they actually package or not.
They are [.filename]#pkg-descr# and [.filename]#pkg-plist#.
Their [.filename]#pkg-# prefix distinguishes them from other files.

[[porting-pkg-descr]]
=== [.filename]#pkg-descr#

This is a longer description of the port.
One to a few paragraphs concisely explaining what the port does is sufficient.

[NOTE]
====
This is _not_ a manual or an in-depth description on how to use or compile the port!
_Please be careful when copying from the [.filename]#README# or manpage_.
Too often they are not a concise description of the port or are in an awkward format.
For example, manpages have justified spacing, which looks particularly bad with monospaced fonts.

On the other hand, the content of [.filename]#pkg-descr# must be longer than the crossref:makefiles[makefile-comment,`COMMENT` line from the Makefile]. It must explain in more depth what the port is all about.
====

A well-written [.filename]#pkg-descr# describes the port completely enough that users would not have to consult the documentation or visit the website to understand what the software does, how it can be useful, or what particularly nice features it has.
Mentioning certain requirements like a graphical toolkit, heavy dependencies, runtime environment, or implementation languages help users decide whether this port will work for them.

[NOTE]
====
The URL that used to be included as the last line of the [.filename]#pkg-descr# file has been moved to the [.filename]#Makefile#.
====

[[porting-pkg-plist]]
=== [.filename]#pkg-plist#

This file lists all the files installed by the port.
It is also called the "packing list" because the package is generated by packing the files listed here.
The pathnames are relative to the installation prefix (usually [.filename]#/usr/local#).

Here is a small example:

[.programlisting]
....
bin/oneko
man/man1/oneko.1.gz
lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
....

Refer to the man:pkg-create[8] manual page for details on the packing list.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to keep all the filenames in this file sorted alphabetically.
It will make verifying changes when upgrading the port much easier.
====

[TIP]
====
Creating a packing list manually can be a very tedious task.
If the port installs a large numbers of files, crossref:plist[plist-autoplist,creating the packing list automatically] might save time.
====

There is only one case when [.filename]#pkg-plist# can be omitted from a port.
If the port installs just a handful of files, list them in `PLIST_FILES`, within the port's [.filename]#Makefile#.
For instance, we could get along without [.filename]#pkg-plist# in the above [.filename]#oneko# port by adding these lines to the [.filename]#Makefile#:

[.programlisting]
....
PLIST_FILES=	bin/oneko \
		man/man1/oneko.1.gz \
		lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm \
		lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm
....

[NOTE]
====
Usage of `PLIST_FILES` should not be abused.
When looking for the origin of a file, people usually try to grep through the [.filename]#pkg-plist# files in the ports tree.
Listing files in `PLIST_FILES` in the [.filename]#Makefile# makes that search more difficult.
====

[TIP]
====
If a port needs to create an empty directory, or creates directories outside of [.filename]#${PREFIX}# during installation, refer to crossref:plist[plist-dir-cleaning,Cleaning Up Empty Directories] for more information.
====

[TIP]
====
As `PLIST_FILES` is a man:make[1] variable, any entry with spaces must be quoted.
For example, if using keywords described in man:pkg-create[8] and crossref:plist[plist-keywords,Expanding Package List with Keywords], the entry must be quoted.

[.programlisting]
....
PLIST_FILES=	"@sample ${ETCDIR}/oneko.conf.sample"
....
====

Later we will see how [.filename]#pkg-plist# and `PLIST_FILES` can be used to fulfill crossref:plist[plist,more sophisticated tasks].

[[porting-checksum]]
== Creating the Checksum File

Just type `make makesum`.
The ports framework will automatically generate [.filename]#distinfo#.
Do not try to generate the file manually.

[[porting-testing]]
== Testing the Port

Make sure that the port rules do exactly what is desired, including packaging up the port.
These are the important points to verify:

* [.filename]#pkg-plist# does not contain anything not installed by the port.
* [.filename]#pkg-plist# contains everything that is installed by the port.
* The port can be installed using the `install` target. This verifies that the install script works correctly.
* The port can be deinstalled properly using the `deinstall` target. This verifies that the deinstall script works correctly.
* The port only has access to network resources during the `fetch` target phase. This is important for package builders, such as package:ports-mgmt/poudriere[].
* Make sure that `make package` can be run as a normal user (that is, not as `root`). If that fails, the software may need to be patched. See also crossref:uses[uses-fakeroot,`fakeroot`] and crossref:uses[uses-uidfix,`uidfix`].

[.procedure]
.Procedure: Recommended Test Ordering
. `make stage`
. `make stage-qa`
. `make package`
. `make install`
. `make deinstall`
. `make package` (as user)

Make certain no warnings are shown in any of the stages.

Thorough automated testing can be done with package:ports-mgmt/poudriere[] from the Ports Collection, see crossref:testing[testing-poudriere,Poudriere] for more information.
It maintains `jails` where all of the steps shown above can be tested without affecting the state of the host system.

[[porting-portlint]]
== Checking the Port with `portlint`

Please use `portlint` to see if the port conforms to our guidelines.
The package:ports-mgmt/portlint[] program is part of the ports collection.
In particular, check that the crossref:porting-samplem[porting-samplem,Makefile] is in the right shape and the crossref:porting-pkgname[porting-pkgname,package] is named appropriately.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not blindly follow the output of `portlint`. It is a static lint tool and sometimes gets things wrong.
====

[[porting-submitting]]
== Submitting the New Port

Before submitting the new port, read the crossref:porting-dads[porting-dads,DOs and DON'Ts] section.

Once happy with the port, the only thing remaining is to put it in the main FreeBSD ports tree and make everybody else happy about it too.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We do not need the [.filename]#work# directory or the [.filename]#pkgname.txz# package, so delete them now.
====

Next, create a man:patch[1], file.
Assuming the port is called `oneko` and is in the `games` category.

[[porting-submitting-diff]]
.Creating a [.filename]#.diff# for a New Port
[example]
====
Add all the files with `git add .`, then review the diff with `git diff`. For example:

[source,shell]
....
% git add .
% git diff --staged
....

Make sure that all required files are included, then commit the change to your local branch and generate a
patch with `git format-patch`

[source,shell]
....
% git commit
% git format-patch origin/main
....

Patch generated with `git format-patch` will include author identity and email addresses, making it
easier for developers to apply (with `git am`) and give proper credit.

[IMPORTANT]
****
To make it easier for committers to apply the patch on their working copy of the ports tree, please generate the [.filename]#.diff# from the base of your ports tree.
****

====

Submit [.filename]#oneko.diff# with the https://bugs.freebsd.org/submit/[bug submission form].
Use product "Ports & Packages", component "Individual Port(s)", and follow the guidelines shown there.
Add a short description of the program to the Description field of the PR (perhaps a short version of `COMMENT`), and remember to add [.filename]#oneko.diff# as an attachment.

[NOTE]
====
Giving a good description in the summary of the problem report makes the work of port committers and triagers a lot easier.
The expected format for new ports is "[NEW PORT] _category/portname short description of the port_" for new ports.
Using this scheme makes it easier and faster to begin the work of committing the new port.
====

After submitting the port, please be patient.
The time needed to include a new port in FreeBSD can vary from a few days to a few months.
A simple search form of the Problem Report database can be searched at https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi[].

To get a listing of _open_ port PRs, select _Open_ and _Ports & Packages_ in the search form, then click btn:[Search].

After looking at the new port, we will reply if necessary, and commit it to the tree.
The submitter's name will also be added to the list of extref:{contributors}[Additional FreeBSD Contributors, contrib-additional] and other files.

It is also possible to submit ports using a man:shar[1] file.
Using the previous example with the `oneko` port above.

.Creating a [.filename]#.shar# for a New Port
[[porting-submitting-shar]]
[example]
====
go to the directory above where the port directory is located, and use `tar` to create the shar archive:

[source,shell]
....
% cd ..
% tar cf oneko.shar --format shar oneko
....
====

[.filename]#oneko.shar# can then be submitted in the same way as [.filename]#oneko.diff# above.

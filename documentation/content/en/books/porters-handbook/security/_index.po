"Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software.  Arguably, the most "
"dangerous of them are those opening security vulnerabilities.  From the "
"technical viewpoint, such vulnerabilities are to be closed by exterminating "
"the bugs that caused them.  However, the policies for handling mere bugs and "
"security vulnerabilities are very different."

"A typical small bug affects only those users who have enabled some "
"combination of options triggering the bug.  The developer will eventually "
"release a patch followed by a new version of the software, free of the bug, "
"but the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading immediately "
"because the bug has never vexed them.  A critical bug that may cause data "
"loss represents a graver issue.  Nevertheless, prudent users know that a lot "
"of possible accidents, besides software bugs, are likely to lead to data "
"loss, and so they make backups of important data; in addition, a critical "
"bug will be discovered really soon."

"A security vulnerability is all different.  First, it may remain unnoticed "
"for years because often it does not cause software malfunction.  Second, a "
"malicious party can use it to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable "
"system, to destroy or alter sensitive data; and in the worst case the user "
"will not even notice the harm caused.  Third, exposing a vulnerable system "
"often assists attackers to break into other systems that could not be "
"compromised otherwise.  Therefore closing a vulnerability alone is not "
"enough: notify the audience of it in the most clear and comprehensive "
"manner, which will allow them to evaluate the danger and take appropriate "
"action."

"The full-blown XML format is complex, and far beyond the scope of this "

"the notion of tags is needed.  XML tag names are enclosed in angle "
"brackets.  Each opening <tag> must have a matching closing </tag>.  Tags may "
"be nested.  If nesting, the inner tags must be closed before the outer ones. "
"There is a hierarchy of tags, that is, more complex rules of nesting them.  "
"This is similar to HTML.  The major difference is that XML is "
"e__X__tensible, that is, based on defining custom tags.  Due to its "
"intrinsic structure XML puts otherwise amorphous data into shape.  VuXML is "

[[uses-intro]]
== An Introduction to `USES`

`USES` macros make it easy to declare requirements and settings for a port.
They can add dependencies, change building behavior, add metadata to packages, and so on, all by selecting simple, preset values.

Each section in this chapter describes a possible value for `USES`, along with its possible arguments.
Arguments are appended to the value after a colon (`:`).
Multiple arguments are separated by commas (`,`).

[[uses-intro-ex1]]

[[uses-7z]]
== `7z`

Possible arguments: (none), `p7zip`, `partial`

Extract using man:7z[1] instead of man:bsdtar[1] and sets `EXTRACT_SUFX=.7z`.
The `p7zip` option forces a dependency on the `7z` from package:archivers/p7zip[] if the one from the base system is not able to extract the files.
`EXTRACT_SUFX` is not changed if the `partial` option is used, this can be used if the main distribution file does not have a [.filename]#.7z# extension.

[[uses-ada]]
== `ada`

Possible arguments: (none), `6`, `12`, `(run)`

Depends on an Ada-capable compiler, and sets `CC` accordingly.
Defaults to use `gcc6-aux` from ports.

[[uses-angr]]
== `angr`

Possible arguments: `binaries`, `nose`

Provide support for ports that need the https://github.com/angr/angr[angrinary analysis platform].

If the `binaries` argument is present, the port requires the special `angr`
binaries for testing.

If the `nose` argument is present, the port uses `nosetests` for the test
target. This argument implies `USES=python:test`.

The framework provides the following variables to be set by the port:

`ANGR_VERSION`::
The version of the `angr` project programs.

`ANGR_BINARIES_TAGNAME`::
The tagname of the `angr` binaries.

`ANGR_NOSETESTS`::
The path to the `nosetests` program.

[[uses-ansible]]
== `ansible`

Possible arguments: `env`, `module`, `plugin`

Provide support for ports depending on package:sysutils/ansible[].

If the `env` argument is present, the port does not depend on
package:sysutils/ansible[] but needs some Ansible variables set.

If the `module` argument is present then the port is an Ansible module.

If the `plugin` argument is present then the port is an Ansible plugin.

The framework exposes the following variables to the port:

`ANSIBLE_CMD`::
Path to the ansible program.

`ANSIBLE_DOC_CMD`::
Path to the ansible-doc program.

`ANSIBLE_RUN_DEPENDS`::
RUN_DEPENDS with the Ansible port.

`ANSIBLE_DATADIR`::
Path to the root of the directory structure where all Ansible's modules and plugins are stored.

`ANSIBLE_ETCDIR`::
Path to the Ansible etc directory.

`ANSIBLE_PLUGINS_PREFIX`::
Path to the "plugins" directory within `${ANSIBLE_DATADIR}`.
`ANSIBLE_MODULESDIR`::
Path to the directory for local Ansible modules.

`ANSIBLE_PLUGINSDIR`::
Path to the directory for local Ansible plugins.

`ANSIBLE_PLUGIN_TYPE`::
Ansible plugin type (e.g., "connection", "inventory", or "vars").

[[uses-apache]]
== `apache`

Possible arguments: (none), `2.4`, `build`, `run`, `server`

Provide support for ports depending on the Apache web server.

The version argument can be used to require a specific Apache httpd version.
It is possible to set a specific version (`USES=apache:2.4`) a minimum version
(`USES=apache:2.4+`) or a maximum version (`USES=apache:-2.4`).

If the `build` argument is provided a build dependency is added to the port.

If the `run` argument is provided a run dependency is added to the port.

If the `server` argument is provided then it indicates the port is a server
port.

The framework provides the following variables to be set by the port:

`AP_FAST_BUILD`::
Automatic module build

`AP_GENPLIST`::
Automatic `PLIST` generation plus add the module disabled into [.filename]#httpd.conf# (only if no `pkg-plist` exist)

`MODULENAME`::
Name of the Apache module. Default: `${PORTNAME}`

`SHORTMODNAME`::
Short name of the Apache module. Default: `${MODULENAME:S/mod_//}`

`SRC_FILE`::
Source file of the APACHE module. Default: `${MODULENAME}.c`

The following variables can be accessed by the port:

`APACHE_VERSION`::
The major-minor release version of the chosen Apache server, e.g. 2.4

`APACHEETCDIR`::
Location of the Apache configuration directory. Default: [.filename]#${LOCALBASE}/etc/apache24#

`APACHEINCLUDEDIR`::
Location of the Apache include files Default: [.filename]#${LOCALBASE}/include/apache24#

`APACHEMODDIR`::
Location of the Apache modules Default: [.filename]#${LOCALBASE}/libxexec/apache24#

`APACHE_DEFAULT`::Default Apache version


[[uses-autoreconf]]
== `autoreconf`

Possible arguments: (none), `build`

Runs `autoreconf`.
It encapsulates the `aclocal`, `autoconf`, `autoheader`, `automake`, `autopoint`, and `libtoolize` commands.
Each command applies to [.filename]#${AUTORECONF_WRKSRC}/configure.ac# or its old name, [.filename]#${AUTORECONF_WRKSRC}/configure.in#.
If [.filename]#configure.ac# defines subdirectories with their own [.filename]#configure.ac# using `AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS`, `autoreconf` will recursively update those as well.
The `:build` argument only adds build time dependencies on those tools but does not run `autoreconf`.
A port can set `AUTORECONF_WRKSRC` if `WRKSRC` does not contain the path to [.filename]#configure.ac#.

[[uses-azurepy]]
== `azurepy`

Possible arguments: (none)

Provide support for `py-azure*` ports.
Removes `azure` namespaces and cleans up common files.

[[uses-blaslapack]]
== `blaslapack`

Possible arguments: (none), `atlas`, `netlib` (default), `gotoblas`, `openblas`

Adds dependencies on Blas / Lapack libraries.

[[uses-bdb]]
== `bdb`

Possible arguments: (none), `5` (default), `18`

Add dependency on the Berkeley DB library.
Default to package:databases/db5[].
It can also depend on package:databases/db18[] when using the `:18` argument.
It is possible to declare a range of acceptable values, `:5+` finds the highest
installed version, and falls back to 5 if nothing else is installed.
`INVALID_BDB_VER` can be used to specify versions which do not work with this port.
The framework exposes the following variables to the port:

`BDB_LIB_NAME`::
The name of the Berkeley DB library.
For example, when using package:databases/db5[], it contains `db-5.3`.

`BDB_LIB_CXX_NAME`::
The name of the Berkeley DBC++ library.
For example, when using package:databases/db5[], it contains `db_cxx-5.3`.

`BDB_INCLUDE_DIR`::
The location of the Berkeley DB include directory.
For example, when using package:databases/db5[], it will contain `${LOCALBASE}/include/db5`.

`BDB_LIB_DIR`::
The location of the Berkeley DB library directory.
For example, when using package:databases/db5[], it contains `${LOCALBASE}/lib`.

`BDB_VER`::
The detected Berkeley DB version.
For example, if using `USES=bdb:5+` and Berkeley DB 18 is installed, it contains `18`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
package:databases/db48[] is deprecated and unsupported.
It must not be used by any port.
====

[[uses-bison]]
== `bison`

Possible arguments: (none), `build`, `run`, `both`

Uses package:devel/bison[] By default, with no arguments or with the `build` argument, it implies `bison` is a build-time dependency, `run` implies a run-time dependency, and `both` implies both run-time and build-time dependencies.

[[uses-budgie]]
== `budgie`

Possible arguments: (none)

Provide support for the Budgie desktop environment.
Use `USE_BUDGIE` to select the components needed for the port.
See crossref:special[using-budgie,Using Budgie] for more information.

[[uses-cabal]]
== `cabal`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ports should not be created for Haskell libraries, see crossref:special[haskell-libs,Haskell Libraries] for more information.
====

Possible arguments: (none), `hpack`, `nodefault`

Sets default values and targets used to build Haskell software using Cabal.
A build dependency on the Haskell compiler port (package:lang/ghc[]) is added.
If there is some other version of GHC already listed in the `BUILD_DEPENDS` variable (for example, package:lang/ghc810[]), it would be used instead.
If the `hpack` argument is given, a build dependency on package:devel/hs-hpack[] is added and `hpack` is invoked at configuration step to
generate .cabal file.
If the `nodefault` argument is given, the framework will not try to pull the main distribution file from the Hackage.
This argument is implicitly added if `USE_GITHUB` or `USE_GITLAB` is present.

The framework provides the following variables:

`CABAL_REVISION`::
Haskell packages hosted on Hackage may have revisions.
Set this knob to an integer number to pull in revised package description.

`USE_CABAL`::
If the software uses Haskell dependencies, list them in this variable.
Each item should be present on Hackage and be listed in form `packagename-_0.1.2_`.
Dependencies can have revisions too, which are specified after the `_` symbol.
Automatic generation of the dependency list is supported, see crossref:special[using-cabal,Building Haskell Applications with `cabal`].

`CABAL_FLAGS`::
List of flags to be passed to `cabal-install` during the configuring and building stage.
The flags are passed verbatim.
This variable is usually used to enable or disable flags that are declared in the .cabal file.
Pass `foo` to enable the `foo` flag and `-foo` to disable it.

`CABAL_EXECUTABLES`::
List of executable files installed by the port.
Default value: `${PORTNAME}`.
Consult the .cabal file of the project being ported to get a list of possible
values for this variable. Each value corresponds to an `executable` stanza in the .cabal file.
Items from this list are automatically added to pkg-plist.

`SKIP_CABAL_PLIST`::
If defined, do not add items from `${CABAL_EXECUTABLES}` to pkg-plist.

`opt_USE_CABAL`::
Adds items to `${USE_CABAL}` depending on `opt` option.

`opt_CABAL_EXECUTABLES`::
Adds items to `${CABAL_EXECUTABLES}` depending on `opt` option.

`opt_CABAL_FLAGS`::
If `opt` is enabled, append the value to `${CABAL_FLAGS}`.
Otherwise, append `-value` to disable the flag.
Note that this behavior is slightly different from the plain `CABAL_FLAGS` as it does not accept values starting with `-`.

`CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS`::
A subset of `${CABAL_EXECUTABLES}` containing Haskell programs to be wrapped into a shell script
that sets `*_datadir` environment variables before running the program.
This also causes the actual Haskell binary to be installed under `libexec/cabal/` directory.
This knob is needed for Haskell programs that install their data files under `share/` directory.

`FOO_DATADIR_VARS`::
List of extra Haskell packages, whose data files should be accessible by the executable named `FOO`.
The executable should be a part of `${CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS}`.
Haskell packages listed there should not have a version suffix.

`CABAL_PROJECT`::
Some Haskell projects may already have a `cabal.project` file, which is also generated by the ports framework.
If that is the case, use this variable to specify what to do with the original `cabal.project`.
Setting this variable to `remove` will cause the original file to be removed.
Setting this variable to `append` will:
. Move the original file to `cabal.project.${PORTNAME}` during the `extract` stage.
. Concatenate the original `cabal.project.${PORTNAME}` and the generated `cabal.project` into a single file after the `patch` stage.
Using `append` makes it possible to perform patching on the original file before it gets merged.

[[uses-cargo]]
== `cargo`

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses Cargo for configuring, building, and testing.
It can be used to port Rust applications that use the Cargo build system.
For more information see crossref:special[using-cargo,Building Rust Applications with `cargo`].

[[uses-charsetfix]]
== `charsetfix`

Possible arguments: (none)

Prevents the port from installing [.filename]#charset.alias#.
This must be installed only by package:converters/libiconv[].
`CHARSETFIX_MAKEFILEIN` can be set to a path relative to `WRKSRC` if [.filename]#charset.alias# is not installed by [.filename]#${WRKSRC}/Makefile.in#.

[[uses-cl]]
== `cl`

Possible arguments: (none)

Provides support for Common Lisp ports.

The framework provides the following variables that can be set by ports:

`ASDF_MODULES`::
List of `ASDF` modules to build when `FASL_TARGET` is set (defaults to `PORTNAME`)

`FASL_TARGET`::
Build fasl variant of port (one of `ccl`, `clisp`, or `sbcl`)

`USE_ASDF`::
Depend on package:devel/cl-asdf[]

`USE_ASDF_FASL`::
Depend on `devel/cl-asdf-<FASL_TARGET>`

`USE_CCL`::

Depend on package:lang/clisp[]; implied when `FASL_TARGET=clisp`

`USE_SBCL`::
Depend on package:lang/sbcl[]; implied when `FASL_TARGET=SBCL`


The framework provides the following variables that can be read by ports:

`ASDF_PATHNAME`::
Path to CL source

`ASDF_REGISTRY`::
Path to CL registry containing asd files

`CCL`::
Path to the Clozure Common Lisp compiler

`CLISP`::
Path to the GNU Common Lisp compiler

`CL_LIBDIR_REL`::
CL library directory relative to `LOCALBASE` or `PREFIX`

`FASL_DIR_REL`::
Relative path to compiled fasl files; depends on `FASL_TARGET`

`FASL_PATHNAME`::
Path to CL fasl

`LISP_EXTRA_ARG`::
Extra arguments used when building fasl

`SBCL`::
Path to the Steel Bank Common Lisp compiler

[[uses-cmake]]
== `cmake`

Possible arguments: (none), `insource`, `noninja`, `run`, `testing`

Use CMake for configuring the port and generating a build system.

By default an out-of-source build is performed, leaving the sources in `WRKSRC` free from build artifacts.
With the `insource` argument, an in-source build will be performed instead.
This argument should be an exception, used only when a regular out-of-source build does not work.

By default Ninja (package:devel/ninja[]) is used for the build.
In some cases this does not work correctly.
With the `noninja` argument, the build will use regular `make` for builds.
This argument should only be used if a Ninja-based build does not work.

With the `run` argument, a run dependency is registered in addition to a build dependency.

With the `testing` argument, a test-target is added that uses CTest.
When running tests the port will be re-configured for testing and re-built.

For more information see crossref:special[using-cmake,Using `cmake`].

[[uses-compiler]]
== `compiler`

Possible arguments: (none), `env` (default, implicit), `{cpp}17-lang`, `{cpp}14-lang`, `{cpp}11-lang`, `gcc-{cpp}11-lib`, `{cpp}11-lib`, `{cpp}0x`, `c11`, `nestedfct`, `features`

Determines which compiler to use based on any given wishes.
Use `{cpp}17-lang` if the port needs a {cpp}17-capable compiler, `{cpp}14-lang` if the port needs a {cpp}14-capable compiler, `{cpp}11-lang` if the port needs a {cpp}11-capable compiler, `gcc-{cpp}11-lib` if the port needs the `g++` compiler with a {cpp}11 library, or `{cpp}11-lib` if the port needs a {cpp}11-ready standard library.
If the port needs a compiler understanding {cpp}0X, C11 or nested functions, the corresponding parameters should be used.

Use `features` to request a list of features supported by the default compiler.
After including [.filename]#bsd.port.pre.mk# the port can inspect the results using these variables:

* `COMPILER_TYPE`: the default compiler on the system, either gcc or clang
* `ALT_COMPILER_TYPE`: the alternative compiler on the system, either gcc or clang. Only set if two compilers are present in the base system.
* `COMPILER_VERSION`: the first two digits of the version of the default compiler.
* `ALT_COMPILER_VERSION`: the first two digits of the version of the alternative compiler, if present.
* `CHOSEN_COMPILER_TYPE`: the chosen compiler, either gcc or clang
* `COMPILER_FEATURES`: the features supported by the default compiler. It currently lists the {cpp} library.

[[uses-cpe]]
== `cpe`

Possible arguments: (none)

Include Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) information in package manifest as a CPE 2.3 formatted string.
See the https://scap.nist.gov/specifications/cpe/[CPE specification] for details.
To add CPE information to a port, follow these steps:

[.procedure]
. Search for the official CPE entry for the software product either by using the NVD's https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/cpe/search[CPE search engine] or in the https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cpe/dictionary/official-cpe-dictionary_v2.3.xml.gz[official CPE dictionary] (warning, very large XML file). _Do not ever make up CPE data._
. Add `cpe` to `USES` and compare the result of `make -V CPE_STR` to the CPE dictionary entry. Continue one step at a time until `make -V CPE_STR` is correct.
. If the product name (second field, defaults to `PORTNAME`) is incorrect, define `CPE_PRODUCT`.
. If the vendor name (first field, defaults to `CPE_PRODUCT`) is incorrect, define `CPE_VENDOR`.
. If the version field (third field, defaults to `PORTVERSION`) is incorrect, define `CPE_VERSION`.
. If the update field (fourth field, defaults to empty) is incorrect, define `CPE_UPDATE`.
. If it is still not correct, check [.filename]#Mk/Uses/cpe.mk# for additional details, or contact the {ports-secteam}.
. Derive as much as possible of the CPE name from existing variables such as `PORTNAME` and `PORTVERSION`. Use variable modifiers to extract the relevant portions from these variables rather than hardcoding the name.
. _Always_ run `make -V CPE_STR` and check the output before committing anything that changes `PORTNAME` or `PORTVERSION` or any other variable which is used to derive `CPE_STR`.

[[uses-cran]]
== `cran`

Possible arguments: (none), `auto-plist`, `compiles`

Uses the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
Specify `auto-plist` to automatically generate [.filename]#pkg-plist#.
Specify `compiles` if the port has code that need to be compiled.

[[uses-desktop-file-utils]]
== `desktop-file-utils`

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses update-desktop-database from package:devel/desktop-file-utils[].
An extra post-install step will be run without interfering with any post-install steps already in the port [.filename]#Makefile#.
A line with crossref:plist[plist-keywords-desktop-file-utils,`@desktop-file-utils`] will be added to the plist.
Only use this macro if the port provides a `.desktop` file which contains a
`MimeType` entry.

[[uses-desthack]]
== `desthack`

Possible arguments: (none)

Changes the behavior of GNU configure to properly support `DESTDIR` in case the original software does not.

[[uses-display]]
== `display`

Possible arguments: (none), _ARGS_

Set up a virtual display environment.
If the environment variable `DISPLAY` is not set, then Xvfb is added as a build dependency, and `CONFIGURE_ENV` is extended with the port number of the currently running instance of Xvfb.
The _ARGS_ parameter defaults to `install` and controls the phase around which to start and stop the virtual display.

[[uses-dos2unix]]
== `dos2unix`

Possible arguments: (none)

The port has files with line endings in DOS format which need to be converted.
Several variables can be set to control which files will be converted.
The default is to convert _all_ files, including binaries.
See crossref:slow-porting[slow-patch-automatic-replacements,Simple Automatic Replacements] for examples.

* `DOS2UNIX_REGEX`: match file names based on a regular expression.
* `DOS2UNIX_FILES`: match literal file names.
* `DOS2UNIX_GLOB`: match file names based on a glob pattern.
* `DOS2UNIX_WRKSRC`: the directory from which to start the conversions. Defaults to `${WRKSRC}`.

[[uses-drupal]]
== `drupal`

Possible arguments: `7`, `module`, `theme`

Automate installation of a port that is a Drupal theme or module.
Use with the version of Drupal that the port is expecting.
For example, `USES=drupal:7,module` says that this port creates a Drupal 7 module.
A Drupal 7 theme can be specified with `USES=drupal:7,theme`.

[[uses-ebur128]]
== `ebur128`

Possible arguments: (none), `build`, `lib`, `run`, `test`

Adds a dependency on package:audio/ebur128[].
It allows to transparently depend on the `rust` or `legacy` variants by using
`DEFAULT_VERSIONS` in [.filename]#make.conf#.
For instance, to use the legacy version, use `DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ebur128=legacy`

When no arguments are used, the behavior is the same as if the `lib` argument
was provided.
The rest of the arguments provide the corresponding category of dependency.

[[uses-eigen]]
== `eigen`

Possible arguments: 2, 3, build (default), run

Add dependency on package:math/eigen[].

[[uses-elextronfix]]
== `electronfix`

Possible arguments: `31`, `32`, `33`

Provide support for easy porting of Electron applications that are distributed in binary form.
Adds a build and run time dependency on package:devel/electron31[],
package:devel/electron32[], or package:devel/electron33[] depending on the argument used.

The framework provides the following variables that can be set by ports:

`ELECTRONFIX_SYMLINK_FILES`::
List of files to be symlinked from Electron distribution.

`ELECTRONFIX_MAIN_EXECUTABLE`::
File name of the main executable to be replaced with the original Electron binary.


[[uses-elfctl]]
== `elfctl`

Possible arguments: (none), `build` (default), `stage`

Set ELF binary feature control notes by setting `ELF_FEATURES`.

When either no argument or the `build` argument is supplied, binaries under `BUILD_WRKSRC` are operated on, and files listed in `ELF_FEATURES` are relative to `BUILD_WRKSRC`.
When the `stage` argument is supplied, binaries under `STAGEDIR` are operated on and files listed in `ELF_FEATURES` are relative to `STAGEDIR`.

[[uses-elfct-ex1]]
.Uses=elfctl
[example]
====
[.programlisting]
....
ELF_FEATURES=	featurelist:path/to/file1 \

[[uses-emacs]]
== `emacs`

Possible arguments: (none) (default), `build`, `run`, `noflavors`

Provides support for ports requiring Emacs.
The `build` argument creates a build dependency on Emacs.
The `run` argument creates a run dependency on Emacs.
If both the `build` and `run` arguments are absent, create build and run
dependencies on Emacs.
The `noflavors` argument prevents flavors, and is implied if there is no run dependency on Emacs.

The default Emacs flavor for ports with `USES=emacs` can be defined in [.filename]#make.conf#.
For example, for the `nox` flavor, use `DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= emacs=nox`.
The valid flavors are: `full`, `canna`, `nox`, `wayland`, `devel_full`, `devel_nox`.

Variables, which can be set by ports:

`EMACS_FLAVORS_EXCLUDE`::
Do NOT build these Emacs flavors.
If `EMACS_FLAVORS_EXCLUDE` is not defined and:

* there is a run dependency on Emacs
* the noflavors argument is not specified

+
then all valid Emacs flavors are assumed.

`EMACS_NO_DEPENDS`::
Do NOT add build or run dependencies on Emacs.
This will prevent flavors, and no byte code files will be generated as part of
the package.

Variables, which can be read by ports:

`EMACS_CMD`::
Emacs command with full path (e.g. [.filename]#/usr/local/bin/emacs-30.1#)

`EMACS_FLAVOR`::
Used for dependencies (e.g. `BUILD_DEPENDS= dash.el${EMACS_PKGNAMESUFFIX}>0:devel/dash@${EMACS_FLAVOR}`)

`EMACS_LIBDIR`::
Emacs Library directory without `${PREFIX}` (e.g. [.filename]#share/emacs#)

`EMACS_LIBDIR_WITH_VER`::
Library directory without `${PREFIX}` including version (e.g.  [.filename]#share/emacs/30.1#)

`EMACS_MAJOR_VER`::
Emacs major version (e.g. 30)

`EMACS_PKGNAMESUFFIX`::
`PKGNAMESUFFIX` to distinguish Emacs flavors

`EMACS_SITE_LISPDIR`::

[[uses-go]]
== `go`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ports should not be created for Go libs, see crossref:special[go-libs,Go Libraries] for more information.
====

Possible arguments: (none), `N.NN`, `N.NN-devel`, `modules`, `no_targets`, `run`

Sets default values and targets used to build Go software.
A build dependency on the Go compiler port is added, port maintainers can set version required.
By default the build is performed in GOPATH mode.
If Go software uses modules, the modules-aware mode can be switched on with `modules` argument.
`no_targets` will setup build environment like `GO_ENV`, `GO_BUILDFLAGS` but skip creating extract and build targets.
`run` will also add a run dependency on the Go compiler port.

The build process is controlled by several variables:

`GO_MODULE`::
The name of the application module as specified by the `module` directive in `go.mod`.
In most cases, this is the only required variable for ports that use Go modules.

`GO_PKGNAME`::
The name of the Go package when building in GOPATH mode.
This is the directory that will be created in `${GOPATH}/src`.
If not set explicitly and `GH_SUBDIR` or `GL_SUBDIR` is present, `GO_PKGNAME` will be inferred from it.
It is not needed when building in modules-aware mode.

`GO_TARGET`::
The packages to build.
The default value is `${GO_PKGNAME}`.
`GO_TARGET` can also be a tuple in the form `package:path` where path can be either a simple filename or a full path starting with `${PREFIX}`.

`GO_TESTTARGET`::
The packages to test.
The default value is `./...` (the current package and all subpackages).

`CGO_CFLAGS`::
Additional `CFLAGS` values to be passed to the C compiler by `go`.

`CGO_LDFLAGS`::
Additional `LDFLAGS` values to be passed to the C compiler by `go`.

`GO_BUILDFLAGS`::
Additional build arguments to be passed to `go build`.

`GO_TESTFLAGS`::
Additional build arguments to be passed to `go test`.

See crossref:special[using-go,Building Go Applications] for usage examples.

[[uses-gperf]]
== `gperf`

Possible arguments: (none)

Add a buildtime dependency on package:devel/gperf[] if `gperf` is not present in the base system.

[[uses-grantlee]]
== `grantlee`

Possible arguments: `5`, `selfbuild`

Handle dependency on Grantlee.
Specify `5` to depend on the Qt5 based version, package:devel/grantlee5[].
`selfbuild` is used internally by package:devel/grantlee5[] to get their versions numbers.

[[uses-groff]]
== `groff`

Possible arguments: `build`, `run`, `both`

Registers a dependency on package:textproc/groff[] if not present in the base system.

[[uses-gssapi]]
== `gssapi`

Possible arguments: (none), `base` (default), `heimdal`, `mit`, `flags`, `bootstrap`

Handle dependencies needed by consumers of the GSS-API.
Only libraries that provide the Kerberos mechanism are available.
By default, or set to `base`, the GSS-API library from the base system is used.
Can also be set to `heimdal` to use package:security/heimdal[], or `mit` to use package:security/krb5[].

When the local Kerberos installation is not in `LOCALBASE`, set `HEIMDAL_HOME` (for `heimdal`) or `KRB5_HOME` (for `krb5`) to the location of the Kerberos installation.

These variables are exported for the ports to use:

* `GSSAPIBASEDIR`
* `GSSAPICPPFLAGS`
* `GSSAPIINCDIR`
* `GSSAPILDFLAGS`
* `GSSAPILIBDIR`
* `GSSAPILIBS`
* `GSSAPI_CONFIGURE_ARGS`

The `flags` option can be given alongside `base`, `heimdal`, or `mit` to automatically add `GSSAPICPPFLAGS`, `GSSAPILDFLAGS`, and `GSSAPILIBS` to `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, and `LDADD`, respectively.
For example, use `base,flags`.

The `bootstrap` option is a special prefix only for use by package:security/krb5[] and package:security/heimdal[].
For example, use `bootstrap,mit`.

[[uses-guile]]
== `guile`

Possible arguments: (none), `_X.Y_`, `flavors`, `build`, `run`, `alias`, `conflicts`

Adds a dependency on Guile.
By default this is a library dependency on the appropriate `libguile*.so`, unless overridden by the `build` and/or `run` option.
The `alias` option configures `BINARY_ALIAS` appropriately (see crossref:makefiles[binary-alias,Use `BINARY_ALIAS`]).

The default version is set by the usual `DEFAULT_VERSIONS` mechanism;
if the default version is not one of the listed versions, then the latest available listed version is used.

Applications using Guile are normally built for only a single Guile version.
However, extension or library modules should use the `flavors` option to build with multiple flavors.

For more information see crossref:special[using-guile,Using Guile].

[[uses-horde]]

* Add `kld` to `CATEGORIES`.
* Set `SSP_UNSAFE`.
* Set `IGNORE` if the kernel sources are not found in `SRC_BASE`.
* Define `KMODDIR` to [.filename]#/boot/modules# by default, add it to `PLIST_SUB` and `MAKE_ENV`, and create it upon installation. If `KMODDIR` is set to [.filename]#/boot/kernel#, it will be rewritten to [.filename]#/boot/modules#. This prevents breaking packages when upgrading the kernel due to [.filename]#/boot/kernel# being renamed to [.filename]#/boot/kernel.old# in the process.
* Handle cross-referencing kernel modules upon installation and deinstallation, using crossref:plist[plist-keywords-kld,`@kld`].
* If the `debug` argument is given, the port can install a debug version of the module into [.filename]#KERN_DEBUGDIR#/[.filename]#KMODDIR#.

[[uses-llvm]]
== `llvm`

Possible arguments: (none), `_XY_`, min=`_XY_`, max=`_XY_`, build, run, lib

Adds a dependency on LLVM.
By default this is a build dependency unless overridden by the `run` or `lib`
options.
The default version is the one set in `LLVM_DEFAULT`. A specific version can be
specified as well. The minimum and maximum versions can be specified with the
`min` and `max` parameters respectively.
The ports framework export the following variables to the port:

`LLVM_VERSION`::
Version chosen from the arguments to llvm.mk
`LLVM_PORT`::
Chosen llvm port
`LLVM_CONFIG`::
llvm-config of the chosen port
`LLVM_LIBLLVM`::
libLLVM.so of the chosen port
`LLVM_PREFIX`::
Installation prefix of the chosen port

[[uses-localbase]]
== `localbase`

Possible arguments: (none), `ldflags`

Ensures that libraries from dependencies in `LOCALBASE` are used instead of the ones from the base system.
Specify `ldflags` to add `-L${LOCALBASE}/lib` to `LDFLAGS` instead of `LIBS`.
Ports that depend on libraries that are also present in the base system should use this.
It is also used internally by a few other `USES`.

[[uses-lua]]
== `lua`

Possible arguments: (none), `_XY_`, `_XY_+`, `-_XY_`, `_XY_-_ZA_`, `module`, `flavors`, `build`, `run`, `env`

Adds a dependency on Lua.
By default this is a library dependency, unless overridden by the `build` and/or `run` option.
The `env` option prevents the addition of any dependency, while still defining all the usual variables.

The default version is set by the usual `DEFAULT_VERSIONS` mechanism, unless a version or range of versions is specified as an argument, for example, `51` or `51-54`.

Applications using Lua are normally built for only a single Lua version.
However, library modules intended to be loaded by Lua code should use the `module` option to build with multiple flavors.

For more information see crossref:special[using-lua,Using Lua].

[[uses-luajit]]
== `luajit`

Possible arguments: (none), `_X_`

Adds a dependency on luajit runtime.
A specific version _X_ can be used. Possible versions are `luajit`, `luajit-devel`, `luajit-openresty`

After including [.filename]#bsd.port.options.mk# or [.filename]#bsd.port.pre.mk# the port can inspect these variables:

`LUAJIT_VER`::
The selected luajit version
`LUAJIT_INCDIR`::
The path to luajit's header files
`LUAJIT_LUAVER`::
Which luajit spec version is selected (2.0 for luajit, else 2.1)

For more information see crossref:special[using-lua,Using Lua].

[[uses-lxqt]]

A specific version _X_ can be used. Possible versions are `6` and `7` (default).
`nox11` indicates that the `-nox11` version of the port is required.
`build`, `run` and `test` add build-, run-time and test dependencies on ImageMagick.

[[uses-makeinfo]]
== `makeinfo`

Possible arguments: (none)

Add a build-time dependency on `makeinfo` if it is not present in the base system.

The `m` and `p` suffixes are for the MariaDB and Percona variants of MySQL.
`server` and `embedded` add a build- and run-time dependency on the MySQL server.
When using `server` or `embedded`, add `client` to also add a dependency on [.filename]#libmysqlclient.so#.
A port can set `IGNORE_WITH_MYSQL` if some versions are not supported.

The framework sets `MYSQL_VER` to the detected MySQL version.

[[uses-mono]]
== `mono`

Possible arguments: (none), `nuget`

Adds a dependency on the Mono (currently only C#) framework by setting the appropriate dependencies.

Specify `nuget` when the port uses nuget packages.

An optional package origin can be added using `_name_=_version_:_origin_`.

The helper target, `buildnuget`, will output the content of the `NUGET_DEPENDS` based on the provided [.filename]#packages.config#.

[[uses-motif]]
== `motif`

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses package:x11-toolkits/open-motif[] as a library dependency.

Possible arguments: (none)

Look for [.filename]#Makefile.in# and [.filename]#configure# in `PATHFIX_WRKSRC` (defaults to `WRKSRC`) and fix common paths to make sure they respect the FreeBSD hierarchy.
For example, it fixes the installation directory of `pkgconfig`'s [.filename]#.pc# files to [.filename]#${PREFIX}/libdata/pkgconfig#.
If the port uses `USES=autoreconf`, [.filename]#Makefile.am# will be added to `PATHFIX_MAKEFILEIN` automatically.

If the port crossref:uses[uses-cmake,`USES=cmake`] it will look for [.filename]#CMakeLists.txt# in `PATHFIX_WRKSRC`.
If needed, that default filename can be changed with `PATHFIX_CMAKELISTSTXT`.

[[uses-pear]]
== `pear`

Possible arguments: `env`

Adds a dependency on package:devel/pear[].
It will setup default behavior for software using the PHP Extension and Application Repository.

See crossref:special[php-pear,PEAR Modules] for more information.

[[uses-perl5]]
== `perl5`

Possible arguments: (none)

Depends on Perl. The configuration is done using `USE_PERL5`.

`USE_PERL5` can contain the phases in which to use Perl, can be `extract`, `patch`, `build`, `run`, or `test`.

`USE_PERL5` can also contain `configure`, `modbuild`, or `modbuildtiny` when [.filename]#Makefile.PL#, [.filename]#Build.PL#,
or Module::Build::Tiny's flavor of [.filename]#Build.PL# is required.

Port maintainer can set version required.
Minimum and maximum versions or a range can be specified; for example, `9.0-`, `8.4+`, `8.4-9.2.`

By default, the added dependency will be the client, but if the port requires additional components,
this can be done using `WANT_PGSQL=_component[:target]_`;
for example, `WANT_PGSQL=server:configure pltcl plperl`.
The available components are:

* `client`

[[uses-php]]
== `php`

Possible arguments: (none), `phpize`, `ext`, `zend`, `build`, `cli`, `cgi`, `mod`, `web`, `embed`, `pecl`, `flavors`, `noflavors`

Provide support for PHP.
Add a runtime dependency on the default PHP version, package:lang/php81[].

`phpize`::
Use to build a PHP extension.
Enables flavors.

`ext`::
Use to build, install and register a PHP extension.
Enables flavors.

`zend`::
Use to build, install and register a Zend extension.
Enables flavors.

`build`::
Set PHP also as a build-time dependency.

`cli`::
Needs the CLI version of PHP.

`cgi`::
Needs the CGI version of PHP.

`mod`::
Needs the Apache module for PHP.

`web`::
Needs the Apache module or the CGI version of PHP.

`embed`::
Needs the embedded library version of PHP.

`pecl`::
Provide defaults for fetching PHP extensions from the PECL repository.
Enables flavors.

`flavors`::
Enable automatic crossref:flavors[flavors-auto-php,PHP flavors] generation.
Flavors will be generated for all PHP versions, except the ones present in
crossref:uses[uses-php-ignore,`IGNORE_WITH_PHP`].

`noflavors`::
Disable automatic PHP flavors generation.
_Must only_ be used with extensions provided by PHP itself.

Variables are used to specify which PHP modules are required, as well as which version of PHP are supported.

`USE_PHP`::
The list of required PHP extensions at run-time.
Add `:build` to the extension name to add a build-time dependency.
Example: `pcre xml:build gettext`

[[uses-php-ignore]]
`IGNORE_WITH_PHP`::
The port does not work with PHP of the given version.
For possible values look at the content of `_ALL_PHP_VERSIONS` in [.filename]#Mk/Uses/php.mk#.

When building a PHP or Zend extension with `:ext` or `:zend`, these variables can be set:

`PHP_MODNAME`::
The name of the PHP or Zend extension.
Default value is `${PORTNAME}`.

`PHP_HEADER_DIRS`::
A list of subdirectories from which to install header files.
The framework will always install the header files that are present in the same directory as the extension.

`PHP_MOD_PRIO`::
The priority at which to load the extension.
It is a number between `00` and `99`.
+
For extensions that do not depend on any extension, the priority is automatically set to `20`, for extensions that depend on another extension, the priority is automatically set to `30`.
Some extensions may need to be loaded before every other extension, for example package:www/php56-opcache[].
Some may need to be loaded after an extension with a priority of `30`.
In that case, add `PHP_MOD_PRIO=_XX_` in the port's Makefile. For example:
+
[.programlisting]
....
USES=		php:ext
USE_PHP=	wddx
PHP_MOD_PRIO=	40
....

These variables are available to use in `PKGNAMEPREFIX` or `PKGNAMESUFFIX`:

`PHP_PKGNAMEPREFIX`::
Contains `php_XY_-` where _XY_ is the current flavor's PHP version.
Use with PHP extensions and modules.

`PHP_PKGNAMESUFFIX`::
Contains `-php_XY_` where _XY_ is the current flavor's PHP version.
Use with PHP applications.

`PECL_PKGNAMEPREFIX`::
Contains `php_XY_-pecl-` where _XY_ is the current flavor's PHP version.
Use with PECL modules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With flavors, all PHP extensions, PECL extensions, PEAR modules _must have_ a different package name,
so they must all use one of these three variables in their `PKGNAMEPREFIX` or `PKGNAMESUFFIX`.
====

[[uses-pkgconfig]]
== `pkgconfig`

Possible arguments: (none), `build` (default), `run`, `both`

Uses package:devel/pkgconf[].

[[uses-pure]]
== `pure`

Possible arguments: (none), `ffi`

Uses package:lang/pure[].
Largely used for building related pure ports.
With the `ffi` argument, it implies package:devel/pure-ffi[] as a run-time dependency.

[[uses-pyqt]]
== `pyqt`

Possible arguments: (none), `4`, `5`

These components are only available with PyQT5:

* `multimediawidgets`
* `printsupport`
* `qml`
* `serialport`
* `webkitwidgets`
* `widgets`

The default dependency for each component is build- and run-time, to select only build or run, add `_build` or `_run` to the component name. For example:

[.programlisting]
....
USES=		pyqt
USE_PYQT=	core doc_build designer_run
....

[[uses-pytest]]
== `pytest`

Possible arguments: (none), 4

Introduces a new dependency on package:devel/pytest[]. It defines a `do-test`
target which will run the tests properly.
Use the argument to depend on a specific package:devel/pytest[] version.
For ports using package:devel/pytest[] consider using this instead of a specific
`do-test` target.
The framework exposes the following variables to the port:

`PYTEST_ARGS`::
Additional arguments to pytest (defaults to empty).

`PYTEST_IGNORED_TESTS`::
lists of `pytest -k` patterns of tests to ignore (defaults to empty). For tests
which are not expected to pass, such as ones requiring a database access.

[[uses-python]]
== `python`

Possible arguments: (none), `_X.Y_`, `_X.Y+_`, `_-X.Y_`, `_X.Y-Z.A_`, `patch`, `build`, `run`, `test`

Uses Python. A supported version or version range can be specified.
If Python is only needed at build time, run time or for the tests, it can be set as a build, run or test dependency with `build`, `run`, or `test`.
If Python is also needed during the patch phase, use `patch`.
See crossref:special[using-python, Using Python] for more information.

`USES=python:env` can be used when the variables exported by the framework are needed but a dependency on Python is not.
It can happen when using with crossref:uses[uses-shebangfix,`USES=shebangfix`], and the goal is only to fix the shebangs but not add a dependency on Python.

[[uses-qmail]]
== `qmail`

Possible arguments: (none), `build`, `run`, `both`, `vars`

Uses package:mail/qmail[]. With the `build` argument, it implies `qmail` as a build-time dependency.

See crossref:special[using-scons,Using `scons`] for more information.

[[uses-sdl]]
== `sdl`

Possible arguments: `sdl`

[[uses-shared-mime-info]]
== `shared-mime-info`

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses update-mime-database from package:misc/shared-mime-info[].
This uses will automatically add a post-install step in such a way that the port itself still can specify there own post-install step if needed.
It also add an crossref:plist[plist-keywords-shared-mime-info,`@shared-mime-info`] entry to the plist.

[[uses-shebangfix]]
== `shebangfix`

Possible arguments: (none)

A lot of software uses incorrect locations for script interpreters, most notably [.filename]#/usr/bin/perl# and [.filename]#/bin/bash#.
The shebangfix macro fixes shebang lines in scripts listed in `SHEBANG_REGEX`, `SHEBANG_GLOB`, or `SHEBANG_FILES`.

`SHEBANG_REGEX`::
Contains _one_ extended regular expressions, and is used with the `-iregex` argument of man:find[1].
See crossref:uses[uses-shebangfix-ex-regex,`USESshebangfix` with `SHEBANG_REGEX`].

`SHEBANG_GLOB`::
Contains a list of patterns used with the `-name` argument of man:find[1].
See crossref:uses[uses-shebangfix-ex-glob,`USESshebangfix` with `SHEBANG_GLOB`].

`SHEBANG_FILES`::
Contains a list of files or man:sh[1] globs.
The shebangfix macro is run from `${WRKSRC}`, so `SHEBANG_FILES` can contain paths that are relative to `${WRKSRC}`.
It can also deal with absolute paths if files outside of `${WRKSRC}` require patching.
See crossref:uses[uses-shebangfix-ex-files,`USESshebangfix` with `SHEBANG_FILES`].

Currently Bash, Java, Ksh, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and Tk are supported by default.

There are three configuration variables:

`SHEBANG_LANG`::
The list of supported interpreters.

`_interp__CMD`::
The path to the command interpreter on FreeBSD.
The default value is `${LOCALBASE}/bin/_interp_`.

`_interp__OLD_CMD`::
The list of wrong invocations of interpreters.
These are typically obsolete paths, or paths used on other operating systems that are incorrect on FreeBSD.
They will be replaced by the correct path in `_interp__CMD`.
+
[NOTE]
====
These will _always_ be part of `_interp__OLD_CMD`: `"/usr/bin/env _interp_" /bin/_interp_ /usr/bin/_interp_ /usr/local/bin/_interp_`.
====
+
[TIP]
====
`_interp__OLD_CMD` contain multiple values.
Any entry with spaces must be quoted.
See crossref:uses[uses-shebangfix-ex-ksh,Specifying all the Paths When Adding an Interpreter to `USESshebangfix`].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The fixing of shebangs is done during the `patch` phase.
If scripts are created with incorrect shebangs during the `build` phase, the build process (for example, the [.filename]#configure# script, or the [.filename]#Makefiles#) must be patched or given the right path (for example, with `CONFIGURE_ENV`, `CONFIGURE_ARGS`, `MAKE_ENV`, or `MAKE_ARGS`) to generate the right shebangs.

Correct paths for supported interpreters are available in `_interp__CMD`.
====

[TIP]
====
When used with crossref:uses[uses-python,`USES=python`], and the aim is only to fix the shebangs but a dependency on Python itself is not wanted, use `USES=python:env` instead.
====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-lua]]
.Adding Another Interpreter to `USES=shebangfix`
[example]
====
To add another interpreter, set `SHEBANG_LANG`.
For example:

[.programlisting]
....
SHEBANG_LANG=	lua
....

====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-ksh]]
.Specifying all the Paths When Adding an Interpreter to `USES=shebangfix`
[example]
====
If it was not already defined, and there were no default values for `_interp__OLD_CMD` and `_interp__CMD` the Ksh entry could be defined as:

[.programlisting]
....
SHEBANG_LANG=	ksh
ksh_OLD_CMD=	"/usr/bin/env ksh" /bin/ksh /usr/bin/ksh
ksh_CMD=	${LOCALBASE}/bin/ksh
....

====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-strange]]
.Adding a Strange Location for an Interpreter
[example]
====
Some software uses strange locations for an interpreter.
For example, an application might expect Python to be located in [.filename]#/opt/bin/python2.7#.
The strange path to be replaced can be declared in the port [.filename]#Makefile#:

[.programlisting]
....
python_OLD_CMD=	/opt/bin/python2.7
....

====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-regex]]
.`USES=shebangfix` with `SHEBANG_REGEX`
[example]
====
To fix all the files in `${WRKSRC}/scripts` ending in [.filename]#.pl#, [.filename]#.sh#, or [.filename]#.cgi# do:

[.programlisting]
....
USES=	shebangfix
SHEBANG_REGEX=	./scripts/.*\.(sh|pl|cgi)
....

[NOTE]
======
`SHEBANG_REGEX` is used by running `find -E`, which uses modern regular expressions also known as extended regular expressions.
See man:re_format[7] for more information.
======

====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-glob]]
.`USES=shebangfix` with `SHEBANG_GLOB`
[example]
====
To fix all the files in `${WRKSRC}` ending in [.filename]#.pl# or [.filename]#.sh#, do:

[.programlisting]
....
USES=	shebangfix
SHEBANG_GLOB=	*.sh *.pl
....

====

[[uses-shebangfix-ex-files]]
.`USES=shebangfix` with `SHEBANG_FILES`
[example]
====
To fix the files [.filename]#script/foobar.pl# and [.filename]#script/*.sh# in `${WRKSRC}`, do:

[.programlisting]
....
USES=	shebangfix
SHEBANG_FILES=	scripts/foobar.pl scripts/*.sh
....

====

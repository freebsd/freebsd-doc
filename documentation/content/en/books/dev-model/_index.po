"Up until now, the FreeBSD project has released a number of described "

"summarising how the project is structured is needed because of the "
"increasing amount of project members.  footnote:[This goes hand-in-hand with "
"Brooks' law that adding another person to a late project will make it later "
"since it will increase the communication needs . A project model is a tool "
"to reduce the communication needs.] This paper will provide such a project "
"model and is donated to the FreeBSD Documentation project where it can "
"evolve together with the project so that it can at any point in time reflect "
"the way the project works.  It is based on [<<thesis, Saers,2003>>]."

"A project model is a means to reduce the communications overhead in a "
"project.  As shown by [<<brooks, Brooks, 1995>>], increasing the number of "
"project participants increases the communication in the project "
"exponentionally.  FreeBSD has during the past few years increased both its "
"mass of active users and committers, and the communication in the project "
"has risen accordingly.  This project model will serve to reduce this "
"overhead by providing an up-to-date description of the project."

"[According to Kirk McKusick, after 20 years of developing UNIX operating "
"systems, the interfaces are for the most part figured out. There is "

"Up until now, the FreeBSD project has released a number of described "

"summarising how the project is structured is needed because of the "

"Brooks' law that adding another person to a late project will make it later "
"since it will increase the communication needs . A project model is a tool "

"model and is donated to the FreeBSD Documentation project where it can "
"evolve together with the project so that it can at any point in time reflect "
"the way the project works.  It is based on [crossref:dev-model[thesis, "

"A project model is a means to reduce the communications overhead in a "

"project has risen accordingly.  This project model will serve to reduce this "

"[According to Kirk McKusick, after 20 years of developing UNIX operating "

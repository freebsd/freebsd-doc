"Security is everyone's responsibility.  A weak entry point in any system "

"The CIA triad is a bedrock concept of computer security as customers and "
"users expect their data to be protected.  For example, a customer expects "
"that their credit card information is securely stored (confidentiality), "

"they have access to their order information at all times (availability)."

"To provide CIA, security professionals apply a defense in depth strategy.  "
"The idea of defense in depth is to add several layers of security to prevent "
"one single layer failing and the entire security system collapsing.  For "
"example, a system administrator cannot simply turn on a firewall and "
"consider the network or system secure.  One must also audit accounts, check "
"the integrity of binaries, and ensure malicious tools are not installed.  To "
"implement an effective security strategy, one must understand threats and "

"When applying security to systems, it is recommended to start by securing "

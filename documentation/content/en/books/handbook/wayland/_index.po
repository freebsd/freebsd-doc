"Wayland is a communication protocol that can replace a display server such "
"as Xorg.  It differs from Xorg in several important ways.  First, Wayland is "
"only a protocol that acts as an intermediary between clients using a "
"mechanism which removes the dependency on an X server.  Xorg includes both "
"the X11 protocol, used to run remote displays, and the X server, used to "
"accept connections and display windows.  Under Wayland, the compositor or "
"window manager provides the display server instead of a traditional X server."

"protocols."

"Wayland is relatively new, and not all software has been updated to run "

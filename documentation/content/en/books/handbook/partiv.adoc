= Network Communication

FreeBSD is one of the most widely deployed operating systems for high performance network servers.
The chapters in this part cover:

* Serial communication
* `PPP` and `PPP` over Ethernet
* Electronic Mail
* Running Network Servers
* Firewalls
* Other Advanced Networking Topics

These chapters are designed to be read when the information is needed.
They do not need to be read in any particular order, nor is it necessary to read all of them before using FreeBSD in a network environment.

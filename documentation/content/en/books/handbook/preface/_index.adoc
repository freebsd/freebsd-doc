[[preface-audience]]
== Intended Audience

The FreeBSD newcomer will find that the first section of this book guides the user through the FreeBSD installation process and gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin UNIX(R). Working through this section requires little more than the desire to explore, and the ability to take on board new concepts as they are introduced.

Once you have traveled this far, the second, far larger, section of the Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest to FreeBSD system administrators. Some of these chapters may recommend that you do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter.

For a list of additional sources of information, please see crossref:bibliography[bibliography,Bibliography].

== Changes from the Third Edition

The current online version of the Handbook represents the cumulative effort of many hundreds of contributors over the past 10 years. The following are some of the significant changes since the two volume third edition was published in 2004:

* crossref:dtrace[dtrace,DTrace] has been added with information about the powerful DTrace performance analysis tool.
* crossref:filesystems[filesystems,Other File Systems] has been added with information about non-native file systems in FreeBSD, such as ZFS from Sun(TM).
* crossref:audit[audit,Security Event Auditing] has been added to cover the new auditing capabilities in FreeBSD and explain its use.
* crossref:virtualization[virtualization,Virtualization] has been added with information about installing FreeBSD on virtualization software.
* crossref:bsdinstall[bsdinstall,Installing FreeBSD] has been added to cover installation of FreeBSD using the new installation utility, bsdinstall.

[[preface-changes-from2]]
== Changes from the Second Edition (2004)

The third edition was the culmination of over two years of work by the dedicated members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project. The printed edition grew to such a size that it was necessary to publish as two separate volumes. The following are the major changes in this new edition:

* crossref:config[config-tuning,Configuration and Tuning] has been expanded with new information about the ACPI power and resource management, the `cron` system utility, and more kernel tuning options.
* crossref:security[security,Security] has been expanded with new information about virtual private networks (VPNs), file system access control lists (ACLs), and security advisories.
* crossref:mac[mac,Mandatory Access Control] is a new chapter with this edition. It explains what MAC is and how this mechanism can be used to secure a FreeBSD system.
* crossref:disks[disks,Storage] has been expanded with new information about USB storage devices, file system snapshots, file system quotas, file and network backed filesystems, and encrypted disk partitions.
* A troubleshooting section has been added to crossref:ppp-and-slip[ppp-and-slip,PPP].
* crossref:mail[mail,Electronic Mail] has been expanded with new information about using alternative transport agents, SMTP authentication, UUCP, fetchmail, procmail, and other advanced topics.
* crossref:network-servers[network-servers,Network Servers] is all new with this edition. This chapter includes information about setting up the Apache HTTP Server, ftpd, and setting up a server for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) clients with Samba. Some sections from crossref:advanced-networking[advanced-networking,Advanced Networking] were moved here to improve the presentation.
* crossref:advanced-networking[advanced-networking,Advanced Networking] has been expanded with new information about using Bluetooth(R) devices with FreeBSD, setting up wireless networks, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking.
* A glossary has been added to provide a central location for the definitions of technical terms used throughout the book.
* A number of aesthetic improvements have been made to the tables and figures throughout the book.

== Changes from the First Edition (2001)

The second edition was the culmination of over two years of work by the dedicated members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project. The following were the major changes in this edition:

* A complete Index has been added.
* All ASCII figures have been replaced by graphical diagrams.
* A standard synopsis has been added to each chapter to give a quick summary of what information the chapter contains, and what the reader is expected to know.
* The content has been logically reorganized into three parts: "Getting Started", "System Administration", and "Appendices".
* crossref:basics[basics,FreeBSD Basics] has been expanded to contain additional information about processes, daemons, and signals.
* crossref:ports[ports,Installing Applications: Packages and Ports] has been expanded to contain additional information about binary package management.
* crossref:x11[x11,The X Window System] has been completely rewritten with an emphasis on using modern desktop technologies such as KDE and GNOME on XFree86(TM) 4.X.
* crossref:boot[boot,The FreeBSD Booting Process] has been expanded.
* crossref:disks[disks,Storage] has been written from what used to be two separate chapters on "Disks" and "Backups". We feel that the topics are easier to comprehend when presented as a single chapter. A section on RAID (both hardware and software) has also been added.
* crossref:serialcomms[serialcomms,Serial Communications] has been completely reorganized and updated for FreeBSD 4.X/5.X.
* crossref:ppp-and-slip[ppp-and-slip,PPP] has been substantially updated.
* Many new sections have been added to crossref:advanced-networking[advanced-networking,Advanced Networking].
* crossref:mail[mail,Electronic Mail] has been expanded to include more information about configuring sendmail.
* crossref:linuxemu[linuxemu,Linux® Binary Compatibility] has been expanded to include information about installing Oracle(R) and SAP(R) R/3(R).
* The following new topics are covered in this second edition:

** crossref:config[config-tuning,Configuration and Tuning].
** crossref:multimedia[multimedia,Multimedia].

[[preface-overview]]
== Organization of This Book

This book is split into five logically distinct sections. The first section, _Getting Started_, covers the installation and basic usage of FreeBSD. It is expected that the reader will follow these chapters in sequence, possibly skipping chapters covering familiar topics. The second section, _Common Tasks_, covers some frequently used features of FreeBSD. This section, and all subsequent sections, can be read out of order. Each chapter begins with a succinct synopsis that describes what the chapter covers and what the reader is expected to already know. This is meant to allow the casual reader to skip around to find chapters of interest. The third section, _System Administration_, covers administration topics. The fourth section, _Network Communication_, covers networking and server topics. The fifth section contains appendices of reference information.

[[preface-conv]]
== Conventions used in this book

To provide a consistent and easy to read text, several conventions are followed throughout the book.

[[preface-conv-typographic]]
=== Typographic Conventions

_Italic_::
An _italic_ font is used for filenames, URLs, emphasized text, and the first usage of technical terms.

`Monospace`::
A `monospaced` font is used for error messages, commands, environment variables, names of ports, hostnames, user names, group names, device names, variables, and code fragments.

Bold::
A *bold* font is used for applications, commands, and keys.

[[preface-conv-commands]]
=== User Input

Keys are shown in *bold* to stand out from other text. Key combinations that are meant to be typed simultaneously are shown with `+` between the keys, such as:

kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Del]

Meaning the user should type the kbd:[Ctrl], kbd:[Alt], and kbd:[Del] keys at the same time.

Keys that are meant to be typed in sequence will be separated with commas, for example:

kbd:[Ctrl+X], kbd:[Ctrl+S]

Would mean that the user is expected to type the kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[X] keys simultaneously and then to type the kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[S] keys simultaneously.

[[preface-conv-examples]]
=== Examples

Examples starting with [.filename]#C:\># indicate a MS-DOS(R) command. Unless otherwise noted, these commands may be executed from a "Command Prompt" window in a modern Microsoft(R) Windows(R) environment.

[source,bash]
....
E:\> tools\fdimage floppies\kern.flp A:
....

Examples starting with # indicate a command that must be invoked as the superuser in FreeBSD. You can login as `root` to type the command, or login as your normal account and use man:su[1] to gain superuser privileges.

[source,bash]
....
# dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0
....

Examples starting with % indicate a command that should be invoked from a normal user account. Unless otherwise noted, C-shell syntax is used for setting environment variables and other shell commands.

[[preface-acknowledgements]]
== Acknowledgments

The book you are holding represents the efforts of many hundreds of people around the world. Whether they sent in fixes for typos, or submitted complete chapters, all the contributions have been useful.

Several companies have supported the development of this document by paying authors to work on it full-time, paying for publication, etc. In particular, BSDi (subsequently acquired by http://www.windriver.com[Wind River Systems]) paid members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project to work on improving this book full time leading up to the publication of the first printed edition in March 2000 (ISBN 1-57176-241-8). Wind River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a number of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add additional chapters to the text. This work culminated in the publication of the second printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN 1-57176-303-1). In 2003-2004, http://www.freebsdmall.com[FreeBSD Mall, Inc], paid several contributors to improve the Handbook in preparation for the third printed edition.

[[preface-audience]]
== Intended Audience

The FreeBSD newcomer will find that the first section of this book guides the user through the FreeBSD installation process and gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin UNIX(R).
Working through this section requires little more than the desire to explore, and the ability to take on board new concepts as they are introduced.

Once reaching this far, the second, far larger, section of the Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest to FreeBSD system administrators.
Some of these chapters may recommend to do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter.

For a list of additional sources of information, please see crossref:bibliography[bibliography,Bibliography].

The following were the major changes in this edition:

* A complete Index has been added.
* All ASCII figures have been replaced by graphical diagrams.
* A standard synopsis has been added to each chapter to give a quick summary of what information the chapter contains, and what the reader is expected to know.
* The content has been logically reorganized into three parts: "Getting Started", "System Administration", and "Appendices".

[[preface-overview]]
== Organization of This Book

This book is split into five logically distinct sections.
The first section, _Getting Started_, covers the installation and basic usage of FreeBSD.
It is expected that the reader will follow these chapters in sequence, possibly skipping chapters covering familiar topics.
The second section, _Common Tasks_, covers some frequently used features of FreeBSD.
This section, and all subsequent sections, can be read out of order.
Each chapter begins with a succinct synopsis that describes what the chapter covers and what the reader is expected to already know.
This is meant to allow the casual reader to skip around to find chapters of interest.
The third section, _System Administration_, covers administration topics.
The fourth section, _Network Communication_, covers networking and server topics.
The fifth section contains appendices of reference information.

[[preface-conv]]
== Conventions used in this book

To provide a consistent and easy to read text, several conventions are followed throughout the book.

[[preface-conv-typographic]]
=== Typographic Conventions

_Italic_::
An _italic_ font is used for filenames, URLs, emphasized text, and the first usage of technical terms.

`Monospace`::
A `monospaced` font is used for error messages, commands, environment variables, names of ports, hostnames, user names, group names, device names, variables, and code fragments.

*Bold*::
A *bold* font is used for applications, commands, and keys.

[[preface-conv-commands]]
=== User Input

Keys are shown in *bold* to stand out from other text.
Key combinations that are meant to be typed simultaneously are shown with `+` between the keys, such as:

kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Del]

Meaning the user should type the kbd:[Ctrl], kbd:[Alt], and kbd:[Del] keys at the same time.

Keys that are meant to be typed in sequence will be separated with commas, for example:

kbd:[Ctrl+X], kbd:[Ctrl+S]

Would mean that the user is expected to type the kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[X] keys simultaneously and then to type the kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[S] keys simultaneously.

[[preface-conv-examples]]
=== Examples

Examples starting with [.filename]#C:\># indicate a MS-DOS(R) command.
Unless otherwise noted, these commands may be executed from a "Command Prompt" window in a modern Microsoft(R) Windows(R) environment.

[source,shell]
....
C:\> tools\fdimage floppies\kern.flp A:
....

Examples starting with # indicate a command that must be invoked as the superuser in FreeBSD.
Login as `root` to type the command, or login as the normal account and use man:su[1] to gain superuser privileges.

[source,shell]
....
# dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0
....

Examples starting with % indicate a command that should be invoked from a normal user account.
Unless otherwise noted, C-shell syntax is used for setting environment variables and other shell commands.

[source,shell]

[[preface-acknowledgements]]
== Acknowledgments

This book represents the efforts of many hundreds of people around the world.
Whether they sent in fixes for typos, or submitted complete chapters, all the contributions have been useful.

Several companies have supported the development of this document by paying authors to work on it full-time, paying for publication, etc.
In particular, BSDi (subsequently acquired by http://www.windriver.com[Wind River Systems]) paid members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project to work on improving this book full time leading up to the publication of the first printed edition in March 2000 (ISBN 1-57176-241-8).
Wind River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a number of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add additional chapters to the text.
This work culminated in the publication of the second printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN 1-57176-303-1).
In 2003-2004, http://www.freebsdmall.com[FreeBSD Mall, Inc], paid several contributors to improve the Handbook in preparation for the third printed edition.
The third printed edition has been split into two volumes.
Both volumes have been published as The FreeBSD Handbook 3rd Edition Volume 1: User Guide (ISBN 1-57176-327-9) and The FreeBSD Handbook 3rd Edition Volume 2: Administrators Guide (ISBN 1-57176-328-7).

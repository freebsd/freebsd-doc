"LDAP uses several terms which should be understood before starting the "
"configuration.  All directory entries consist of a group of _attributes_.  "
"Each of these attribute sets contains a unique identifier known as a "
"_Distinguished Name_ (DN) which is normally built from several other "
"attributes such as the common or _Relative Distinguished Name_ (RDN).  "
"Similar to how directories have absolute and relative paths, consider a DN "

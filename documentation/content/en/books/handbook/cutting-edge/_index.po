"FreeBSD is under constant development between releases.  Some people prefer "
"to use the officially released versions, while others prefer to keep in sync "

"used, FreeBSD provides all the necessary tools to keep the system updated, "

"When multiple machines need to track the same source tree, it is a waste of "
"disk space, network bandwidth, and CPU cycles to have each system download "
"the sources and rebuild everything.  The solution is to have one machine do "
"most of the work, while the rest of the machines mount that work via NFS.  "
"This section outlines a method of doing so.  For more information about "
"using NFS, refer to crossref:network-servers[network-nfs,\"Network File "

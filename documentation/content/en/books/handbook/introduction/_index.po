"The original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of 386BSD in order "

"of solving.  The early working title for the project was 386BSD 0.5 or "
"386BSD Interim in reference to that fact."

"386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up to that point "
"suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth of neglect.  As the "
"patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with each passing day, they decided "
"to assist Bill by providing this interim \"cleanup\" snapshot.  Those plans "
"came to a rude halt when Bill Jolitz suddenly decided to withdraw his "
"sanction from the project without any clear indication of what would be done "

"The trio thought that the goal remained worthwhile, even without Bill's "
"support, and so they adopted the name \"FreeBSD\" coined by David Greenman.  "
"The initial objectives were set after consulting with the system's current "
"users and, once it became clear that the project was on the road to perhaps "
"even becoming a reality, Jordan contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with an eye "
"toward improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for those many unfortunates "
"without easy access to the Internet.  Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported "
"the idea of distributing FreeBSD on CD but also went so far as to provide "
"the project with a machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  "
"Without Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what "
"was, at the time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that "
"FreeBSD would have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today."

"The first CD-ROM (and general net-wide) distribution was FreeBSD 1.0, "

"tape from U.C. Berkeley, with many components also provided by 386BSD and "

"Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on the horizon "
"as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running lawsuit over the "
"legal status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape.  A condition of that settlement was "
"U.C. Berkeley's concession that three files of Net/2 were \"encumbered\" "
"code and had to be removed as they were the property of Novell, who had in "
"turn acquired it from AT&T some time previously.  What Berkeley got in "
"return was Novell's \"blessing\" that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when it was "
"finally released, would be declared unencumbered and all existing Net/2 "
"users would be strongly encouraged to switch.  This included FreeBSD, and "
"the project was given until the end of July 1994 to stop shipping its own "
"Net/2 based product.  Under the terms of that agreement, the project was "
"allowed one last release before the deadline, that release being FreeBSD "
"1.1.5.1."

"FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally re-inventing itself "

"Although only three files having to do with System V shared memory and "
"semaphores were removed, many other changes and bug fixes had been made to "
"the BSD distribution, so it was a huge task to merge all the FreeBSD "
"developments into 4.4BSD-Lite.  It took the project until November of 1994 "
"to make this transition, and in December it released FreeBSD 2.0 to the "
"world.  Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges, the "
"release was a significant success and was followed by the more robust and "

"_users_ of FreeBSD, who are provided with an easy way of tracking one "
"central code base, not to keep potential contributors out! Our desire is to "
"present a stable operating system with a large set of coherent crossref:"
"ports[ports,application programs] that the users can easily install and use "
"- this model works very well in accomplishing that."

"In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a ported software "
"collection with thousands of commonly sought-after programs.  The list of "
"ports ranges from HTTP servers to games, languages, editors, and almost "
"everything in between.  There are about {numports} ports; the entire Ports "
"Collection requires approximately {ports-size}.  To compile a port, you "
"simply change to the directory of the program you wish to install, type "
"`make install`, and let the system do the rest.  The full original "
"distribution for each port you build is retrieved dynamically so you need "
"only enough disk space to build the ports you want."

"toward improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for those many unfortunates "
"without easy access to the Internet.  Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported "
"the idea of distributing FreeBSD on CD but also went so far as to provide "
"the project with a machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  "
"Without Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what "
"was, at the time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that "
"FreeBSD would have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today."

"Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on the horizon "
"as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running lawsuit over the "
"legal status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape.  A condition of that settlement was "
"U.C. Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were \"encumbered\" "
"code and the property of Novell, who had in turn acquired it from AT&T some "
"time previously.  What Berkeley got in return was Novell's \"blessing\" that "
"the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when it was finally released, would be declared "
"unencumbered and all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to "
"switch.  This included FreeBSD, and the project was given until the end of "
"July 1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product.  Under the terms of "
"that agreement, the project was allowed one last release before the "
"deadline, that release being FreeBSD 1.1.5.1."

"FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally re-inventing itself "

"\"Lite\" releases were light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had removed "
"large chunks of code required for actually constructing a bootable running "
"system (due to various legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel port "
"of 4.4 was highly incomplete.  It took the project until November of 1994 to "
"make this transition, and in December it released FreeBSD 2.0 to the world.  "
"Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges, the release "
"was a significant success and was followed by the more robust and easier to "

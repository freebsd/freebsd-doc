"FreeBSD supports security extensions based on the POSIX(R).1e draft.  These "
"security mechanisms include file system Access Control Lists (crossref:"
"security[fs-acl,“Access Control Lists”]) and Mandatory Access Control "
"(MAC).  MAC allows access control modules to be loaded in order to implement "
"security policies.  Some modules provide protections for a narrow subset of "
"the system, hardening a particular service.  Others provide comprehensive "
"labeled security across all subjects and objects.  The mandatory part of the "
"definition indicates that enforcement of controls is performed by "
"administrators and the operating system.  This is in contrast to the default "
"security mechanism of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) where enforcement "
"is left to the discretion of users."

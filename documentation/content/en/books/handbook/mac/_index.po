"FreeBSD supports security extensions based on the POSIX(R).1e draft.  These "
"security mechanisms include file system Access Control Lists "
"(crossref:security[fs-acl,“Access Control Lists”]) and Mandatory Access "
"Control (MAC).  MAC allows access control modules to be loaded in order to "
"implement security policies.  Some modules provide protections for a narrow "
"subset of the system, hardening a particular service.  Others provide "
"comprehensive labeled security across all subjects and objects.  The "
"mandatory part of the definition indicates that enforcement of controls is "
"performed by administrators and the operating system.  This is in contrast "
"to the default security mechanism of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) "
"where enforcement is left to the discretion of users."

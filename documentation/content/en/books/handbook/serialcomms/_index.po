"There are two schools of thought regarding dial-up modems.  One "
"configuration method is to set the modems and systems so that no matter at "
"what speed a remote user dials in, the dial-in RS-232 interface runs at a "
"locked speed.  The benefit of this configuration is that the remote user "
"always sees a system login prompt immediately.  The downside is that the "
"system does not know what a user's true data rate is, so full-screen "
"programs like Emacs will not adjust their screen-painting methods to make "
"their response better for slower connections."

"The second method is to configure the RS-232 interface to vary its speed "
"based on the remote user's connection speed.  As `getty` does not understand "
"any particular modem's connection speed reporting, it gives a `login:` "
"message at an initial speed and watches the characters that come back in "
"response.  If the user sees junk, they should press kbd:[Enter] until they "
"see a recognizable prompt.  If the data rates do not match, `getty` sees "
"anything the user types as junk, tries the next speed, and gives the `login:"
"` prompt again.  This procedure normally only takes a keystroke or two "
"before the user sees a good prompt.  This login sequence does not look as "
"clean as the locked-speed method, but a user on a low-speed connection "
"should receive better interactive response from full-screen programs."

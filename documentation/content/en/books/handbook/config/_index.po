"Historically, the default behavior was to write out meta-data updates "

"was actually written to disk.  The file data buffers (file contents) were "
"passed through the buffer cache and backed up to disk later on "
"asynchronously.  The advantage of this implementation is that it operates "
"safely.  If there is a failure during an update, meta-data is always in a "
"consistent state.  A file is either created completely or not at all.  If "
"the data blocks of a file did not find their way out of the buffer cache "
"onto the disk by the time of the crash, man:fsck[8] recognizes this and "
"repairs the file system by setting the file length to `0`.  Additionally, "
"the implementation is clear and simple.  The disadvantage is that meta-data "
"changes are slow.  For example, `rm -r` touches all the files in a directory "
"sequentially, but each directory change will be written synchronously to the "
"disk.  This includes updates to the directory itself, to the inode table, "
"and possibly to indirect blocks allocated by the file.  Similar "
"considerations apply for unrolling large hierarchies using `tar -x`."

"The second approach is to use asynchronous meta-data updates.  This is the "
"default for a UFS file system mounted with `mount -o async`.  Since all meta-"
"data updates are also passed through the buffer cache, they will be "
"intermixed with the updates of the file content data.  The advantage of this "
"implementation is there is no need to wait until each meta-data update has "
"been written to disk, so all operations which cause huge amounts of meta-"
"data updates work much faster than in the synchronous case.  This "
"implementation is still clear and simple, so there is a low risk for bugs "
"creeping into the code.  The disadvantage is that there is no guarantee for "
"a consistent state of the file system If there is a failure during an "
"operation that updated large amounts of meta-data, like a power failure or "
"someone pressing the reset button, the file system will be left in an "
"unpredictable state.  There is no opportunity to examine the state of the "
"file system when the system comes up again as the data blocks of a file "
"could already have been written to the disk while the updates of the inode "
"table or the associated directory were not.  It is impossible to implement a "
"man:fsck[8] which is able to clean up the resulting chaos because the "

"The usual solution for this problem is to implement _dirty region logging_, "

"disadvantage is that all meta-data is written twice, once into the logging "

"Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley FFS, solved this problem with Soft "

"\"catch\" the earlier ones which are still in memory and have not already "

= Common Tasks

Now that the basics have been covered, this part of the book discusses some frequently used features of FreeBSD. These chapters:

* Introduce popular and useful desktop applications: browsers, productivity tools, document viewers, and more.
* Introduce a number of multimedia tools available for FreeBSD.
* Explain the process of building a customized FreeBSD kernel to enable extra functionality.
* Describe the print system in detail, both for desktop and network-connected printer setups.
* Show how to run Linux applications on the FreeBSD system.

Some of these chapters recommend prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter.

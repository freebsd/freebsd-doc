"_Routing_ is the mechanism that allows a system to find the network path to "
"another system.  A _route_ is a defined pair of addresses which represent "
"the \"destination\" and a \"gateway\".  The route indicates that when trying "
"to get to the specified destination, send the packets through the specified "
"gateway.  There are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, "
"and \"default\".  The \"default route\" is used if no other routes apply.  "
"There are also three types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces, also "
"called links, and Ethernet hardware (MAC) addresses.  Known routes are "
"stored in a routing table."

"Most wireless networks are based on the IEEE(R) 802.11 standards.  A basic "
"wireless network consists of multiple stations communicating with radios "

"802.11 networks are organized in two ways.  In _infrastructure mode_, one "
"station acts as a master with all the other stations associating to it, the "
"network is known as a BSS, and the master station is termed an access point "
"(AP).  In a BSS, all communication passes through the AP; even when one "
"station wants to communicate with another wireless station, messages must go "
"through the AP.  In the second form of network, there is no master and "
"stations communicate directly.  This form of network is termed an IBSS and "

"include the operating frequencies and the MAC layer characteristics, "
"including framing and transmission rates, as communication can occur at "
"various rates.  Later, the 802.11a standard defined operation in the 5GHz "
"band, including different signaling mechanisms and higher transmission "
"rates.  Still later, the 802.11g standard defined the use of 802.11a "

"Separate from the underlying transmission techniques, 802.11 networks have a "
"variety of security mechanisms.  The original 802.11 specifications defined "
"a simple security protocol called WEP.  This protocol uses a fixed pre-"
"shared key and the RC4 cryptographic cipher to encode data transmitted on a "
"network.  Stations must all agree on the fixed key in order to communicate.  "
"This scheme was shown to be easily broken and is now rarely used except to "
"discourage transient users from joining networks.  Current security practice "
"is given by the IEEE(R) 802.11i specification that defines new cryptographic "
"ciphers and an additional protocol to authenticate stations to an access "
"point and exchange keys for data communication.  Cryptographic keys are "
"periodically refreshed and there are mechanisms for detecting and countering "
"intrusion attempts.  Another security protocol specification commonly used "
"in wireless networks is termed WPA, which was a precursor to 802.11i.  WPA "
"specifies a subset of the requirements found in 802.11i and is designed for "
"implementation on legacy hardware.  Specifically, WPA requires only the TKIP "
"cipher that is derived from the original WEP cipher.  802.11i permits use of "
"TKIP but also requires support for a stronger cipher, AES-CCM, for "
"encrypting data.  The AES cipher was not required in WPA because it was "
"deemed too computationally costly to be implemented on legacy hardware."

"Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol used together with "
"802.11 networks to address the lack of proper authentication and the "
"weakness of WEP.  WPA leverages the 802.1X authentication protocol and uses "
"one of several ciphers instead of WEP for data integrity.  The only cipher "
"required by WPA is the Temporary Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP).  TKIP is a "
"cipher that extends the basic RC4 cipher used by WEP by adding integrity "
"checking, tamper detection, and measures for responding to detected "
"intrusions.  TKIP is designed to work on legacy hardware with only software "
"modification.  It represents a compromise that improves security but is "
"still not entirely immune to attack.  WPA also specifies the AES-CCMP cipher "
"as an alternative to TKIP, and that is preferred when possible.  For this "
"specification, the term WPA2 or RSN is commonly used."

"File systems are an integral part of any operating system.  They allow users "
"to upload and store files, provide access to data, and make hard drives "
"useful.  Different operating systems differ in their native file system.  "
"Traditionally, the native FreeBSD file system has been the Unix File System "
"UFS which has been modernized as UFS2.  Since FreeBSD 7.0, the Z File System "
"(ZFS) is also available as a native file system.  See crossref:zfs[zfs,The Z "
"File System (ZFS)] for more information."

"In addition to its native file systems, FreeBSD supports a multitude of "
"other file systems so that data from other operating systems can be accessed "
"locally, such as data stored on locally attached USB storage devices, flash "
"drives, and hard disks.  This includes support for the Linux(R) Extended "
"File System (EXT)."

"Some require a kernel module to be loaded and others may require a toolset "
"to be installed.  Some non-native file system support is full read-write "

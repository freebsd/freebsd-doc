"Xen(TM) is a bare-metal hypervisor, which means that it is the first program "

"(`Dom0` for short) is then started.  The Dom0 uses its special privileges to "
"directly access the underlying physical hardware, making it a high-"
"performance solution.  It is able to access the disk controllers and network "
"adapters directly.  The Xen(TM) management tools to manage and control the "
"Xen(TM) hypervisor are also used by the Dom0 to create, list, and destroy "
"VMs.  Dom0 provides virtual disks and networking for unprivileged domains, "
"often called `DomU`.  Xen(TM) Dom0 can be compared to the service console of "
"other hypervisor solutions, while the DomU is where individual guest VMs are "

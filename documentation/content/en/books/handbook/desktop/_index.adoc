[[desktop-synopsis]]
== Synopsis

While FreeBSD is popular as a server for its performance and stability, it is also well suited for day-to-day use as a desktop.
With over {numports} applications available in the FreeBSD ports tree, it is straightforward to build a customized desktop that can run a wide variety of desktop applications.
This chapter demonstrates how to install popular desktop environments as well as desktop applications such as web browsers, productivity software, document viewers, and financial software.

Prerequisites:

* Readers of this chapter should already understand how to install either the crossref:x11[x11,X Window System] or crossref:wayland[wayland,Wayland] on FreeBSD.
* Readers are instructed throughout this chapter to install official packages.
Refer to the section on crossref:ports[ports-using,using the ports collection] to build customized packages from ports.

[[desktop-environments]]
== Desktop Environments

This section describes how to install and configure some popular desktop environments on a FreeBSD system.
A desktop environment can range from a simple window manager to a complete suite of desktop applications.

[[kde-environment]]
=== KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma is an easy-to-use desktop environment.
This desktop provides a suite of applications with a consistent look and feel, a standardized menu and toolbars, keybindings, color-schemes, internationalization, and a centralized, dialog-driven desktop configuration.
More information on KDE can be found at the link:https://kde.org/[KDE homepage].
For FreeBSD-specific information, consult the link:https://freebsd.kde.org/[FreeBSD homepage at KDE].

[[kde-meta-install]]
==== Install KDE Plasma meta package

To install the KDE Plasma meta package with KDE Frameworks, Plasma Desktop and Applications execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install kde
....

[[kde-minimal-install]]
==== Minimal KDE Plasma installation

To install a minimal KDE Plasma execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install plasma6-plasma
....

[TIP]
====
This installation is *really* minimal.
Konsole must be installed separately executing:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install konsole
....
====

[[kde-configuration]]
==== Configure KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma uses man:dbus-daemon[1] for a message bus and hardware abstraction.
This application is automatically installed as a dependency of KDE Plasma.

Enable D-BUS service in `/etc/rc.conf` to start at system boot:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc dbus_enable="YES"
....

KDE Plasma requires larger message sizes for optimal performance.

Add the following lines to man:sysctl.conf[5]:

[.programlisting]
....
sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=65536
sysctl net.local.stream.sendspace=65536
....

To apply the change, either run the following command as root or simply reboot the system:

[source,shell]
....
# sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf
....

[[kde-start]]
==== Start KDE Plasma

The preferred KDE Plasma display manager is package:x11/sddm[].
To install package:x11/sddm[], execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install sddm
....

Enable SDDM service in `/etc/rc.conf` to start at system boot:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc sddm_enable="YES"
....

The keyboard language can be set in SDDM by running the following command (for Spanish, for example):

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc sddm_lang="es_ES"
....

A second method to start KDE Plasma is by manually invoking man:startx[1].
For this to work, the following line is needed in ~/.xinitrc:

[source,shell]
....
% echo "exec dbus-launch --exit-with-x11 ck-launch-session startplasma-x11" > ~/.xinitrc
....

[[gnome-environment]]
=== GNOME

GNOME is a user-friendly desktop environment.

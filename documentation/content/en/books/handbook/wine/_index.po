"It operates by intercepting system calls, or requests from the software to "

"that FreeBSD understands.  It will also translate any responses as needed "

"However, it is not an emulator in the traditional sense.  Many of these "
"solutions operate by constructing an entire other computer using software "

"the package:emulators/qemu[] port) operates in this way.  One of the "
"benefits of this approach is the ability to install a full version of the OS "
"in question to the emulator.  It means that the environment will not look "
"any different to applications than a real machine, and chances are good that "
"everything will work on it.  The downside to this approach is the fact that "
"software acting as hardware is inherently slower than actual hardware.  The "
"computer built in software (called the _guest_) requires resources from the "

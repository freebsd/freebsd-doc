"It operates by intercepting system calls, or requests from the software to "

"this approach is the ability to install a full version of the OS in question "

"to applications than a real machine, and chances are good that everything "
"will work on it.  The downside to this approach is the fact that software "
"acting as hardware is inherently slower than actual hardware.  The computer "

"retrieves that data, WINE facilitates fetching it from the host system and "
"passing it back to the Windows(R) application."

"DTrace, also known as Dynamic Tracing, was developed by Sun(TM) as a tool "
"for locating performance bottlenecks in production and pre-production "
"systems.  In addition to diagnosing performance problems, DTrace can be used "
"to help investigate and debug unexpected behavior in both the FreeBSD kernel "
"and in userland programs."

"DTrace is a remarkable profiling tool, with an impressive array of features "
"for diagnosing system issues.  It may also be used to run pre-written "
"scripts to take advantage of its capabilities.  Users can author their own "
"utilities using the DTrace D Language, allowing them to customize their "
"profiling based on specific needs."

"The FreeBSD implementation provides full support for kernel DTrace and "
"experimental support for userland DTrace.  Userland DTrace allows users to "
"perform function boundary tracing for userland programs using the `pid` "
"provider, and to insert static probes into userland programs for later "
"tracing.  Some ports, such as package:databases/postgresql12-server[] and "
"package:lang/php74[] have a DTrace option to enable static probes."

Multimedia applications and technologies have become an integral part of modern computing, and FreeBSD provides robust and reliable support for a wide range of multimedia hardware and software.
This chapter covers various multimedia components such as audio, video, and image processing.
It also discusses various media formats and codecs, as well as tools and applications for multimedia creation and playback.
Additionally, the chapter covers multimedia system configuration, troubleshooting, and optimization.
Whether you are a multimedia enthusiast or a professional content creator, FreeBSD offers a robust platform for multimedia work.
This chapter aims to help get the most out of FreeBSD's multimedia capabilities, providing useful information and practical examples to help get started.

[[sound-setup]]
== Setting Up the Sound Card

By default, FreeBSD will automatically detect the sound card used by the system.
FreeBSD supports a wide variety of sound cards.
The list of supported sound cards can be consulted in man:sound[4].

[NOTE]
====
It is only necessary to load the sound card module if FreeBSD has not detected it correctly.
====

Where it is not known which sound card the system has, or which module to use, the `snd_driver` metadriver can be loaded by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# kldload snd_driver
....

Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in [.filename]#/boot/loader.conf#:

[.programlisting]
....
snd_driver_load="YES"
....

[[sound-testing]]
=== Testing Sound

To confirm the sound card is detected the following command can be executed:

[source,shell]
....
% dmesg | grep pcm
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
pcm0: <Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa) (Analog 2.0+HP/2.0)> at nid 26,22 and 24 on hdaa0
pcm1: <Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa) (Internal Analog Mic)> at nid 29 on hdaa0
....

The status of the sound card may also be checked using this command:

[source,shell]
....
# cat /dev/sndstat
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Installed devices:
pcm0: <Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa) (Analog 2.0+HP/2.0)> (play/rec) default
pcm1: <Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa) (Internal Analog Mic)> (rec)
....

If no `pcm` devices are listed, double-check that the correct device driver was loaded.
If all goes well, the sound card should now work in FreeBSD.

man:beep[1] can be used to produce some noise, confirming that the sound card is working:

[source,shell]
....
% beep
....

[[sound-mixer]]
=== Mixer

FreeBSD has different utilities to set and display sound card mixer values built on the FreeBSD Sound System:

.Supported mixer packages
[options="header", cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Name | License | Package | Toolkit

| man:mixer[8]
| BSD-2
| Included in base system
| CLI

| dsbmixer
| BSD-2
| package:audio/dsbmixer[]
| Qt

| KDE Plasma audio widget
| GPL 2.0
| package:audio/plasma6-plasma-pa[]
| Qt

| mixertui
| BSD-2
| package:audio/mixertui[]
| TUI

|===

[[graphics-card-sound]]
=== Graphics Card Sound

Graphics cards often come with their own integrated sound devices, and it may be unclear which is being used as the default device.
To confirm, run dmesg and look for the pcm entries to identify how the system is enumerating the outputs.
Execute the following command:

[source,shell]
....
% dmesg | grep pcm
....

The output looks something like this:

[.programlisting]
....
pcm0: <HDA NVIDIA (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> at cad 0 nid 1 on hdac0
pcm1: <HDA NVIDIA (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> at cad 1 nid 1 on hdac0
pcm2: <HDA NVIDIA (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> at cad 2 nid 1 on hdac0
pcm3: <HDA NVIDIA (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> at cad 3 nid 1 on hdac0
hdac1: HDA Codec #2: Realtek ALC889
pcm4: <HDA Realtek ALC889 PCM #0 Analog> at cad 2 nid 1 on hdac1
pcm5: <HDA Realtek ALC889 PCM #1 Analog> at cad 2 nid 1 on hdac1
pcm6: <HDA Realtek ALC889 PCM #2 Digital> at cad 2 nid 1 on hdac1
pcm7: <HDA Realtek ALC889 PCM #3 Digital> at cad 2 nid 1 on hdac1
....

The graphics card (NVIDIA(R)) has been enumerated before the sound card (Realtek(R)), with the sound card appearing as `pcm4`.
The system can be configured to use the sound card as the default device by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=4
....

To make this change permanent add the next line to [.filename]#/etc/sysctl.conf#:

[.programlisting]
....
hw.snd.default_unit=4
....

[[automatically-switching-headphones]]
=== Automatically Switching to Headphones

Some systems may struggle with switching between audio outputs, but fortunately FreeBSD allows automatic switchover to be configured in [.filename]#device.hints#.

Identify how the system is enumerating the audio outputs by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
% dmesg | grep pcm
....

The output looks something like this:

[.programlisting]
....
pcm0: <Realtek ALC892 Analog> at nid 23 and 26 on hdaa0
pcm1: <Realtek ALC892 Right Analog Headphones> at nid 22 on hdaa0
....

Add the following lines to [.filename]#/boot/device.hints#:

[.programlisting]
....
hint.hdac.0.cad0.nid22.config="as=1 seq=15 device=Headphones" 
hint.hdac.0.cad0.nid26.config="as=2 seq=0 device=speakers"
....

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that these values are for the example indicated above.
They may vary depending on the system.
====

[[troubleshooting-sound]]
=== Troubleshooting Sound

Some common error messages and their solutions:

[[multimedia-sound-common-error-messages]]
.Common Error Messages
[cols="1,1", frame="none", options="header"]
|===
| Error
| Solution

|`xxx: can't open /dev/dsp!`
|Type `fstat \| grep dsp` to check if another application is holding the device open. Noteworthy troublemakers are esound and KDE's sound support.
|===

Programs using package:audio/pulseaudio[] might need to restart the
package:audio/pulseaudio[] daemon for the changes in `hw.snd.default_unit`  to
take effect.
Alternatively, package:audio/pulseaudio[] settings can be changed on the fly.
man:pacmd[1] opens a command line connection to the package:audio/pulseaudio[]
daemon:

[source,shell]
....
# pacmd
Welcome to PulseAudio 14.2! Use "help" for usage information.
>>>
....

The following command changes the default sink to card number 4 as in
the previous example:

[.programlisting]
....
set-default-sink 4
....

[WARNING]
====
Do not use the `exit` command to exit the command line interface. That will kill
the package:audio/pulseaudio[] daemon. Use kbd:[Ctrl+D] instead.
====

# pkg install kodi
....

[[conferencing-meetings]]
== Conferencing and Meetings

A FreeBSD desktop environment can be used to join video conferences.
This section will explain how to configure the webcam and which videoconferencing applications are supported on FreeBSD.

[[webcam-setup]]
=== Setting Up the Webcam

To allow FreeBSD access to the webcam and perform its configuration it is necessary to install certain utilities:

* package:multimedia/webcamd[] is a daemon that enables the use of hundreds of different USB based webcam and DVB USB devices.
* package:multimedia/pwcview[] is an application that can be used to view the video stream of the webcam.

To install the required utilities, execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install webcamd pwcview
....

Enable the man:webcamd[8] service in `/etc/rc.conf` to start it at system boot:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc webcamd_enable=YES
....

The user must belong to the `webcamd` group.
To add the user to `webcamd` group execute the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# pw groupmod webcamd -m username
....

Since package:multimedia/webcamd[] needs the man:cuse[3] module this module must be loaded by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# kldload cuse
....

To load man:cuse[3] at system boot, execute the command:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc kld_list+=cuse
....

Once the utilities have been installed the list of available webcams can be shown with man:webcamd[8]:

[source,shell]
....
# webcamd -l
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
webcamd [-d ugen0.2] -N SunplusIT-Inc-HP-TrueVision-HD-Camera -S unknown -M 0 <.>
webcamd [-d ugen1.3] -N Realtek-802-11n-WLAN-Adapter -S 00e04c000001 -M 0
....
<.> Available webcam

Configure the available webcam executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc webcamd_0_flags="-d ugen0.2" <.>
....

[NOTE]
====
Note here that if this is a plug-and-play USB webcam, changing the USB port to which it is connected will change the output from `webcamd -l`, and the entry in rc.conf might need to be updated.
For laptops that use USB integrated webcams, this should not be an issue.
====

The man:webcamd[8] service must be started by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# service webcamd start
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
Starting webcamd.
webcamd 1616 - - Attached to ugen0.2[0]
....

package:multimedia/pwcview[] can be used to check the proper functioning of the webcam.
The following command can be used to execute package:multimedia/pwcview[]:

[source,shell]
....
% pwcview -f 30 -s vga
....

Then package:multimedia/pwcview[] will display the webcam:

image::pwcview.png[pwcview showing Absolute FreeBSD 3rd edition as an example]

[[meetings-software-status]]

[[scanners]]
== Image Scanners

In FreeBSD, access to image scanners is provided by link:http://www.sane-project.org[SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)], which is available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

[[scanners-kernel-usb]]
=== Checking the Scanner

Before attempting any configuration it is important to check the scanner is supported by SANE.

With the scanner connected, run the following command to get all connected USB devices:

[source,shell]
....
# usbconfig list
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
ugen4.2: <LITE-ON Technology USB NetVista Full Width Keyboard.> at usbus4, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=LOW (1.5Mbps) pwr=ON (70mA)
ugen4.3: <Logitech USB Optical Mouse> at usbus4, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=LOW (1.5Mbps) pwr=ON (100mA)
ugen3.2: <HP Deskjet 1050 J410 series> at usbus3, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=HIGH (480Mbps) pwr=ON (2mA)
....

Run the following command to obtain the `idVendor` and the `idProduct`:

[source,shell]
....
# usbconfig -d 3.2 dump_device_desc
....

[NOTE]
====
Note here that the scanner is a plug-and-play device, and changing the USB port to which it is connected will change the output from `usbconfig list`.
====

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
ugen3.2: <HP Deskjet 1050 J410 series> at usbus3, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=HIGH (480Mbps) pwr=ON (2mA)

bLength = 0x0012
bDescriptorType = 0x0001
bcdUSB = 0x0200
bDeviceClass = 0x0000  <Probed by interface class>
bDeviceSubClass = 0x0000
bDeviceProtocol = 0x0000
bMaxPacketSize0 = 0x0040
idVendor = 0x03f0
idProduct = 0x8911
bcdDevice = 0x0100
iManufacturer = 0x0001  <HP>
iProduct = 0x0002  <Deskjet 1050 J410 series>
bNumConfigurations = 0x0001
....

Once the `idVendor` and the `idProduct` have been obtained, it is necessary to check in the link:http://www.sane-project.org/lists/sane-mfgs-cvs.html[list of supported devices of SANE] if the scanner is supported by filtering by the idProduct. 

[[_sane_configuration]]
=== SANE Configuration

SANE provides the access to the scanner via backends.
To be able to scan with FreeBSD the package:graphics/sane-backends[] package must be installed by running the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install sane-backends
....

[TIP]
====
Some USB scanners require firmware to be loaded.
Like the HP scanner used in the example above, which needs the package package:print/hplip[] installed.
====

After installing the necessary packages man:devd[8] must be configured to allow FreeBSD access to the scanner.

Add the `saned.conf` file to [.filename]#/usr/local/etc/devd/saned.conf# with the following content:

[.programlisting]
....
notify 100 {
        match "system" "USB";
        match "subsystem" "INTERFACE";
        match "type" "ATTACH";
        match "cdev" "ugen[0-9].[0-9]";
        match "vendor" "0x03f0"; <.>
        match "product" "0x8911"; <.>
        action "chown -L cups:saned /dev/\$cdev && chmod -L 660 /dev/\$cdev";
};
....

<.> `vendor`: Is the idVendor obtained previously by running the `usbconfig -d 3.2 dump_device_desc` command.
<.> `product`: Is the idProduct obtained previously by running the `usbconfig -d 3.2 dump_device_desc` command.

After that man:devd[8] must be restarted by running the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# service devd restart
....

The SANE backends include man:scanimage[1] which can be used to list the devices and perform an image acquisition.

Execute man:scanimage[1] with `-L` argument to list the scanner devices:

[source,shell]
....
# scanimage -L
....

The output should be similar to the following:

[.programlisting]
....
device `hpaio:/usb/Deskjet_1050_J410_series?serial=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX' is a Hewlett-Packard Deskjet_1050_J410_series all-in-one
....

If man:scanimage[1] is not able to identify the scanner, this message will appear:

[.programlisting]
....
No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
sane-find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation
which came with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).
....

Once man:scanimage[1] sees the scanner, the configuration is complete and the scanner is now ready to use.

To activate the service and have it run at boot execute the following command:

[source,shell]
....
# sysrc saned_enable=YES
....

While man:scanimage[1] can be used to perform an image acquisition from the command line, it is often preferable to use a graphical interface to perform image scanning.

"Since system administration is a difficult task, many tools have been "

"enhance the way systems are installed, configured, and maintained.  One of "
"the tools which can be used to enhance the security of a FreeBSD system is "
"_jails_.  Jails have been available since FreeBSD 4.X and continue to be "
"enhanced in their usefulness, performance, reliability, and security."

"Jails build upon the man:chroot[2] concept, which is used to change the root "
"directory of a set of processes.  This creates a safe environment, separate "
"from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted environment "
"can not access files or resources outside of it.  For that reason, "
"compromising a service running in a chrooted environment should not allow "
"the attacker to compromise the entire system."

"In a traditional chroot environment, processes are only limited in the part "

"this model by virtualizing access to the file system, the set of users, and "

The name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a sleep `mutex`) that protects a large set of kernel resources.
Although a simple locking mechanism was adequate in the days where a machine might have only a few dozen processes, one networking card, and certainly only one processor, in current times it is an unacceptable performance bottleneck.
FreeBSD developers are actively working to replace it with locks that protect individual resources, which will allow a much greater degree of parallelism for both single-processor and multi-processor machines.

Lock Order Reversal::
The FreeBSD kernel uses a number of resource locks to arbitrate contention for those resources.
A run-time lock diagnostic system found in FreeBSD-CURRENT kernels (but removed for releases), called man:witness[4], detects the potential for deadlocks due to locking errors.
(man:witness[4] is actually slightly conservative, so it is possible to get false positives.)
A true positive report indicates that “if you were unlucky, a deadlock would have happened here”.

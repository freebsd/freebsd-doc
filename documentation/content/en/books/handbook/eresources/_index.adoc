The FreeBSD user community provides much technical support -- with forums, chat and email amongst the most popular and effective means of communication.

Some of the most important areas are listed below.
The link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Community[Community wiki page] may include more up-to-date listings.

Please make the {freebsd-doc} aware of any resource that is either redundant, or not yet listed below.

[[eresources-irc]]
== Internet Relay Chat

IRC is a widely-implemented, technically mature, open standard for text chat.

link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Channels[] lists FreeBSD-related channels.

Some of the listed IRC servers offer bridging with link:https://matrix.org/[Matrix] -- an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

[[eresources-mail]]
== FreeBSD Mailing Lists

{mailing-lists-url} -- more than one hundred public lists, spanning a variety of topics.

Choosing an appropriate list increases the likelihood of a rapid and accurate response.

All users and developers of FreeBSD should subscribe to the {freebsd-announce}.

[NOTE]
====
To test FreeBSD mailing list capabilities, aim for the {freebsd-test}.
Please do not send test messages to any other list.
====

Posts to the public lists are archived in perpetuity.
If privacy is a concern, consider using a disposable email address.

If you are unsure about which list to address, see extref:{freebsd-questions-article}[How to get best results from the FreeBSD-questions mailing list].

Before posting to any list, please:

* learn about how to best use the lists, such as how to help avoid frequently-repeated discussions, by reading the extref:{mailing-list-faq}[Mailing List Frequently Asked Questions] (FAQ) document
* search the archives, to tell whether someone else has already posted what you intend to post.

Archive search interfaces include: 
 
- https://lists.freebsd.org/search[] (FreeBSD, experimental)
- https://www.freebsd.org/search/[] (DuckDuckGo)
- https://freebsd.markmail.org/[] (MarkMail)

FreeBSD-provided archives:
 
* do not present links as links
* do not present inline images
* do not present HTML content of HTML messages.

[[eresources-subscribe]]
=== How to Subscribe or Unsubscribe

At {mailing-lists-url}, click the name of a list to reveal its options.

To post, after subscribing, send email to `listname@FreeBSD.org`.
The message will be distributed to list members.

[[eresources-charters]]
=== Rules

All posters must adhere to these rules. 
Failure to comply will result in two (2) written warnings from the FreeBSD Postmaster mailto:postmaster@FreeBSD.org[postmaster@FreeBSD.org], after which, on a third offense, the poster will removed from all FreeBSD mailing lists and filtered from further posting to them.

We regret that such rules and measures are necessary at all, but today's Internet is a pretty harsh environment, it would seem, and many fail to appreciate just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.

Rules of the road:

* The topic of any post should adhere to the description of the list to which it is posted. If the list is for technical issues, the post should contain technical discussion. Irrelevant chatter or flaming detracts from the value of a list for and will not be tolerated. For non-technical discussion relating to the community, aim for the {freebsd-chat}.
* No post should address more than two lists, and two _only_ if there is a clear and obvious need to address both. For most lists, there is a great deal of subscriber overlap, and except for the most esoteric mixes (say "-stable & -scsi"), there really is no reason to post to more than one. If you receive an email with multiple lists on the `Cc` line, trim this line before replying. No matter who the originator was, _the person who replies is responsible for cross-posting._
* Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument) are not allowed. This applies to users and developers alike. Gross breaches of netiquette, such as excerpting or reposting private email when permission to do so was not and would not be forthcoming, are frowned upon but not specifically enforced.
* Advertising of non-FreeBSD related products or services is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban if it is clear that the offender is advertising by spam.

[[eresources-mailfiltering]]
=== Filtering

The lists are filtered in multiple ways to avoid spam, viruses, and other unwanted content.
The filtering actions described in this section do not include all those used to protect the lists.

Only certain types of attachments are allowed.
All attachments with a MIME content type not listed below will be stripped before an email is distributed.

* application/octet-stream
* application/pdf
* application/pgp-signature
* application/x-pkcs7-signature
* message/rfc822
* multipart/alternative
* multipart/related
* multipart/signed
* text/html
* text/plain
* text/x-diff
* text/x-patch

[NOTE]
====
The stripping above applies to most lists.
Few lists are more permissive.
====

If a multi-part message includes text/plain and text/html parts:

- addressees will receive both parts
- lists.freebsd.org will present text/plain with an option to view original text (source, with raw HTML amongst the parts).

If text/plain does not accompany text/html:

- there will be conversion from HTML to plain text.

[[eresources-news]]

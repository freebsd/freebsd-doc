The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a means of following the latest developments.
Electronic resources are the best, if not often the only, way to stay informed of the latest advances.
Since FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also generally serves as a "technical support department" of sorts, with electronic mail, web forums, and USENET news being the most effective way of reaching that community.

The most important points of contact with the FreeBSD user community are outlined below.
There is a possibly more up to date list on the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Community[community portal on the FreeBSD Wiki].
Please send other resources not mentioned here to the {freebsd-doc} so that they may also be included.

[[eresources-www]]
== Websites

* The link:https://forums.FreeBSD.org/[FreeBSD Forums] provide a web based discussion forum for FreeBSD questions and technical discussion.
* The link:https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/[FreeBSD Wiki] provides various bits of information that hadn't yet made it into the Handbook.
* The link:https://docs.FreeBSD.org/[FreeBSD Documentation website] doesn't provide just the Users's Handbook; there are other handbooks and articles that are worth a read.
* The link:https://freebsdfoundation.org/our-work/journal/browser-based-edition/[FreeBSD Journal] is a free, professionally-edited, bi-monthly technical magazine released by link:https://freebsdfoundation.org[FreeBSD Foundation].
* The link:http://www.youtube.com/bsdconferences[BSDConferences YouTube Channel] provides a collection of high quality videos from BSD conferences around the world. This is a great way to watch key developers give presentations about new work in FreeBSD.
* link:https://www.freebsd.org/status/[FreeBSD Status Reports] are released every three months and track progress of FreeBSD development.
* There's a link:https://www.reddit.com/r/freebsd/[FreeBSD-focused Reddit group] at r/freebsd.

* link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Channels[IRC channels], a widely implemented, technically mature, open standard text chat.

[[eresources-mail]]
== Mailing Lists

The mailing lists are the most direct way of addressing questions or opening a technical discussion to a concentrated FreeBSD audience.
There are a wide variety of lists on a number of different FreeBSD topics.
Sending questions to the most appropriate mailing list will invariably assure a faster and more accurate response.

The charters for the various lists are given at the bottom of this document.
_Please read the charter before joining or sending mail to any list_.
Most list subscribers receive many hundreds of FreeBSD related messages every day, and the charters and rules for use are meant to keep the signal-to-noise ratio of the lists high.
To do less would see the mailing lists ultimately fail as an effective communications medium for the Project.

[NOTE]
====
_To test the ability to send email to FreeBSD lists, send a test message to {freebsd-test}._
Please do not send test messages to any other list.
====

When in doubt about what list to post a question to, see extref:{freebsd-questions-article}[How to get best results from the FreeBSD-questions mailing list].

Before posting to any list, please learn about how to best use the mailing lists, such as how to help avoid frequently-repeated discussions, by reading the extref:{mailing-list-faq}[Mailing List Frequently Asked Questions] (FAQ) document.

Archives are kept for all of the mailing lists and can be searched using the link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/search/[FreeBSD World Wide Web server].
The keyword searchable archive offers an excellent way of finding answers to frequently asked questions and should be consulted before posting a question.
Note that this also means that messages sent to FreeBSD mailing lists are archived in perpetuity.
When protecting privacy is a concern, consider using a disposable secondary email address and posting only public information.

[[eresources-subscribe]]
=== How to Subscribe

To subscribe to a list, click the list name at {mailing-lists-url}.
The page that is displayed should contain all of the necessary subscription instructions for that list.

To actually post to a given list, send mail to mailto:listname@FreeBSD.org[listname@FreeBSD.org].
It will then be redistributed to mailing list members world-wide.

To unsubscribe from a list, click on the URL found at the bottom of every email received from the list.
It is also possible to send an email to mailto:listname+unsubscribe@FreeBSD.org[listname+unsubscribe@FreeBSD.org] to unsubscribe.

It is important to keep discussion in the technical mailing lists on a technical track.
To only receive important announcements, instead join the {freebsd-announce}, which is intended for infrequent traffic.

[[eresources-charters]]
=== List Charters

_All_ FreeBSD mailing lists have certain basic rules which must be adhered to by anyone using them.
Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in two (2) written warnings from the FreeBSD Postmaster mailto:postmaster@FreeBSD.org[postmaster@FreeBSD.org], after which, on a third offense, the poster will removed from all FreeBSD mailing lists and filtered from further posting to them.
We regret that such rules and measures are necessary at all, but today's Internet is a pretty harsh environment, it would seem, and many fail to appreciate just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.

Rules of the road:

* The topic of any posting should adhere to the basic charter of the list it is posted to. If the list is about technical issues, the posting should contain technical discussion. Ongoing irrelevant chatter or flaming only detracts from the value of the mailing list for everyone on it and will not be tolerated. For free-form discussion on no particular topic, the {freebsd-chat} is freely available and should be used instead.
* No posting should be made to more than 2 mailing lists, and only to 2 when a clear and obvious need to post to both lists exists. For most lists, there is already a great deal of subscriber overlap and except for the most esoteric mixes (say "-stable & -scsi"), there really is no reason to post to more than one list at a time. If a message is received with multiple mailing lists on the `Cc` line, trim the `Cc` line before replying. _The person who replies is still responsible for cross-posting, no matter who the originator might have been._
* Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument) are not allowed, and that includes users and developers alike. Gross breaches of netiquette, like excerpting or reposting private mail when permission to do so was not and would not be forthcoming, are frowned upon but not specifically enforced. _However_, there are also very few cases where such content would fit within the charter of a list and it would therefore probably rate a warning (or ban) on that basis alone.
* Advertising of non-FreeBSD related products or services is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban if it is clear that the offender is advertising by spam.

_Individual list charters:_

link:{freebsd-acpi-url}[freebsd-acpi]::
_ACPI and power management development_

link:{freebsd-announce-url}[freebsd-announce]::
_Important events / milestones_
+
This is the mailing list for people interested only in occasional announcements of significant FreeBSD events.
This includes announcements about snapshots and other releases.
It contains announcements of new FreeBSD capabilities.
It may contain calls for volunteers etc.
This is a low volume, strictly moderated mailing list.

link:{freebsd-arch-url}[freebsd-arch]::
_Architecture and design discussions_
+
This list is for discussion of the FreeBSD architecture.
Messages will mostly be kept strictly technical in nature.
Examples of suitable topics are:

** How to re-vamp the build system to have several customized builds running at the same time.
** What needs to be fixed with VFS to make Heidemann layers work.
** How do we change the device driver interface to be able to use the same drivers cleanly on many buses and architectures.
** How to write a network driver.

link:{freebsd-bluetooth-url}[freebsd-bluetooth]::
_Bluetooth(R) in FreeBSD_
+
This is the forum where FreeBSD's Bluetooth(R) users congregate.
Design issues, implementation details, patches, bug reports, status reports, feature requests, and all matters related to Bluetooth(R) are fair game.

link:{freebsd-bugbusters-url}[freebsd-bugbusters]::
_Coordination of the Problem Report handling effort_
+
The purpose of this list is to serve as a coordination and discussion forum for the Bugmeister, his Bugbusters, and any other parties who have a genuine interest in the PR database.
This list is not for discussions about specific bugs, patches or PRs.

link:{freebsd-bugs-url}[freebsd-bugs]::
_Bug reports_
+
This is the mailing list for reporting bugs in FreeBSD.
Whenever possible, bugs should be submitted using the link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi[web interface].

link:{freebsd-chat-url}[freebsd-chat]::
_Non technical items related to the FreeBSD community_
+
This list contains the overflow from the other lists about non-technical, social information.
It includes discussion about whether Jordan looks like a toon ferret or not, whether or not to type in capitals, who is drinking too much coffee, where the best beer is brewed, who is brewing beer in their basement, and so on.
Occasional announcements of important events (such as upcoming parties, weddings, births, new jobs, etc) can be made to the technical lists, but the follow ups should be directed to this -chat list.

link:{freebsd-chromium-url}[freebsd-chromium]::
_FreeBSD-specific Chromium issues_

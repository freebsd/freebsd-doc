"File systems are contained in _partitions_.  Disks are divided into "
"partitions using one of several partitioning schemes; see "
"crossref:bsdinstall[bsdinstall-part-manual, Manual Partitioning].  The newer "
"scheme is GPT; older BIOS-based computers use MBR.  GPT supports division of "
"a disk into partitions with a size, offset, and type.  It supports a large "
"number of partitions and partition types, and is recommended whenever its "
"use is possible.  GPT partitions use the disk name with a suffix, where the "
"suffix is `p1` for the first partition, `p2` for the second, and so on.  "
"MBR, however, supports only a small number of partitions.  The MBR "
"partitions are known in FreeBSD as `slices`.  Slices may be used for "
"different operating systems.  FreeBSD slices are subdivided into partitions "
"using BSD labels (see man:bsdlabel[8])."

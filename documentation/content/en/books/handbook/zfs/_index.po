msgid ""
"More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different from traditional "
"file systems.  Combining the traditionally separate roles of volume manager "
"and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages.  The file system is now "
"aware of the underlying structure of the disks.  Traditional file systems "
"could exist on a single disk alone at a time.  If there were two disks then "
"creating two separate file systems was necessary.  A traditional hardware "
"RAID configuration avoided this problem by presenting the operating system "
"with a single logical disk made up of the space provided by physical disks "
"on top of which the operating system placed a file system.  Even with "
"software RAID solutions like those provided by GEOM, the UFS file system "
"living on top of the RAID believes it's dealing with a single device.  ZFS' "
"combination of the volume manager and the file system solves this and allows "
"the creation of file systems that all share a pool of available storage.  "
"One big advantage of ZFS' awareness of the physical disk layout is that "
"existing file systems grow automatically when adding extra disks to the "
"pool.  This new space then becomes available to the file systems.  ZFS can "
"also apply different properties to each file system. This makes it useful to "
"create separate file systems and datasets instead of a single monolithic "
"file system."

"Unlike traditional disks and volume managers, space in ZFS is _not_ "

"features like compression, deduplication, caching, and quotas, as well as "

"crossref:zfs[zfs-term-snapshot,Snapshots] are one of the most powerful "
"features of ZFS.  A snapshot provides a read-only, point-in-time copy of the "
"dataset.  With Copy-On-Write (COW), ZFS creates snapshots fast by preserving "
"older versions of the data on disk.  If no snapshots exist, ZFS reclaims "
"space for future use when data is rewritten or deleted.  Snapshots preserve "
"disk space by recording just the differences between the current dataset and "
"a previous version.  Allowing snapshots on whole datasets, not on individual "
"files or directories.  A snapshot from a dataset duplicates everything "
"contained in it.  This includes the file system properties, files, "
"directories, permissions, and so on.  Snapshots use no extra space when "
"first created, but consume space as the blocks they reference change.  "
"Recursive snapshots taken with `-r` create snapshots with the same name on "
"the dataset and its children, providing a consistent moment-in-time snapshot "
"of the file systems.  This can be important when an application has files on "
"related datasets or that depend upon each other.  Without snapshots, a "
"backup would have copies of the files from different points in time."

"Snapshots in ZFS provide a variety of features that even other file systems "
"with snapshot functionality lack.  A typical example of snapshot use is as a "
"quick way of backing up the current state of the file system when performing "
"a risky action like a software installation or a system upgrade.  If the "
"action fails, rolling back to the snapshot returns the system to the same "
"state when creating the snapshot.  If the upgrade was successful, delete the "
"snapshot to free up space.  Without snapshots, a failed upgrade often "
"requires restoring backups, which is tedious, time consuming, and may "
"require downtime during which the system is unusable.  Rolling back to "
"snapshots is fast, even while the system is running in normal operation, "
"with little or no downtime.  The time savings are enormous with multi-"
"terabyte storage systems considering the time required to copy the data from "
"backup.  Snapshots are not a replacement for a complete backup of a pool, "
"but offer a quick and easy way to store a dataset copy at a specific time."

"More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different.  ZFS combines the "

"roles, ZFS is able to overcome previous limitations that prevented RAID "

"* [[zfs-term-vdev-mirror]] _Mirror_ - When creating a mirror, specify the `mirror` keyword followed by the list of member devices for the mirror. A mirror consists of two or more devices, writing all data to all member devices. A mirror vdev will hold as much data as its smallest member. A mirror vdev can withstand the failure of all but one of its members without losing any data.\n"

ZFS supports three levels of RAID-Z which provide varying levels of redundancy in exchange for decreasing levels of usable storage.

"In a RAID-Z3 configuration with eight disks of 1 TB, the volume will provide 5 TB of usable space and still be able to operate with three faulted disks. Sun(TM) recommends no more than nine disks in a single vdev. If more disks make up the configuration, the recommendation is to divide them into separate vdevs and stripe the pool data across them.\n"
"+\n"
"A configuration of two RAID-Z2 vdevs consisting of 8 disks each would create something like a RAID-60 array. A RAID-Z group's storage capacity is about the size of the smallest disk multiplied by the number of non-parity disks. Four 1 TB disks in RAID-Z1 has an effective size of about 3 TB, and an array of eight 1 TB disks in RAID-Z3 will yield 5 TB of usable space.\n"

msgid "ZFS uses an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), rather than a more traditional Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a simple list of items in the cache, sorted by how recently object was used, adding new items to the head of the list. When the cache is full, evicting items from the tail of the list makes room for more active objects. An ARC consists of four lists; the Most Recently Used (MRU) and Most Frequently Used (MFU) objects, plus a ghost list for each. These ghost lists track evicted objects to prevent adding them back to the cache. This increases the cache hit ratio by avoiding objects that have a history of occasional use. Another advantage of using both an MRU and MFU is that scanning an entire file system would evict all data from an MRU or LRU cache in favor of this freshly accessed content. With ZFS, there is also an MFU that tracks the most frequently used objects, and the cache of the most commonly accessed blocks remains."

ZFS keeps a deduplication table (DDT) in memory to detect duplicate blocks. The table contains a list of unique checksums, the location of those blocks, and a reference count. When writing new data, ZFS calculates checksums and compares them to the list. When finding a match it uses the existing block. Using the SHA256 checksum algorithm with deduplication provides a secure cryptographic hash. Deduplication is tunable. If `dedup` is `on`, then a matching checksum means that the data is identical. Setting `dedup` to `verify`, ZFS performs a byte-for-byte check on the data ensuring they are actually identical. If the data is not identical, ZFS will note the hash collision and store the two blocks separately. As the DDT must store the hash of each unique block, it consumes a large amount of memory. A general rule of thumb is 5-6 GB of ram per 1 TB of deduplicated data). In situations not practical to have enough RAM to keep the entire DDT in memory, performance will suffer greatly as the DDT must read from disk before writing each new block. Deduplication can use L2ARC to store the DDT, providing a middle ground between fast system memory and slower disks. Consider using compression instead, which often provides nearly as much space savings without the increased memory."

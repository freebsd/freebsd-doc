msgid ""
"More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different from traditional "
"file systems.  Combining the traditionally separate roles of volume manager "
"and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages.  The file system is now "
"aware of the underlying structure of the disks.  Traditional file systems "
"could exist on a single disk alone at a time.  If there were two disks then "
"creating two separate file systems was necessary.  A traditional hardware "
"RAID configuration avoided this problem by presenting the operating system "
"with a single logical disk made up of the space provided by physical disks "
"on top of which the operating system placed a file system.  Even with "
"software RAID solutions like those provided by GEOM, the UFS file system "
"living on top of the RAID believes it's dealing with a single device.  ZFS' "
"combination of the volume manager and the file system solves this and allows "
"the creation of file systems that all share a pool of available storage.  "
"One big advantage of ZFS' awareness of the physical disk layout is that "
"existing file systems grow automatically when adding extra disks to the "
"pool.  This new space then becomes available to the file systems.  ZFS can "
"also apply different properties to each file system. This makes it useful to "
"create separate file systems and datasets instead of a single monolithic "
"file system."

"Unlike traditional disks and volume managers, space in ZFS is _not_ "
"preallocated.  With traditional file systems, after partitioning and "
"assigning the space, there is no way to add a new file system without adding "
"a new disk.  With ZFS, creating new file systems is possible at any time.  "
"Each <<zfs-term-dataset,_dataset_>> has properties including features like "
"compression, deduplication, caching, and quotas, as well as other useful "
"properties like readonly, case sensitivity, network file sharing, and a "
"mount point.  Nesting datasets within each other is possible and child "

"Delegate>>, <<zfs-zfs-send,replicate>>, <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,snapshot>>, <<zfs-"
"zfs-jail,jail>> allows administering and destroying each dataset as a unit.  "
"Creating a separate dataset for each different type or set of files has "
"advantages.  The drawbacks to having a large number of datasets are that "
"some commands like `zfs list` will be slower, and that mounting of hundreds "

"<<zfs-term-snapshot,Snapshots>> are one of the most powerful features of "
"ZFS.  A snapshot provides a read-only, point-in-time copy of the dataset.  "
"With Copy-On-Write (COW), ZFS creates snapshots fast by preserving older "
"versions of the data on disk.  If no snapshots exist, ZFS reclaims space for "
"future use when data is rewritten or deleted.  Snapshots preserve disk space "
"by recording just the differences between the current dataset and a previous "
"version.  Allowing snapshots on whole datasets, not on individual files or "
"directories.  A snapshot from a dataset duplicates everything contained in "
"it.  This includes the file system properties, files, directories, "
"permissions, and so on.  Snapshots use no extra space when first created, "
"but consume space as the blocks they reference change.  Recursive snapshots "
"taken with `-r` create snapshots with the same name on the dataset and its "
"children, providing a consistent moment-in-time snapshot of the file "
"systems.  This can be important when an application has files on related "
"datasets or that depend upon each other.  Without snapshots, a backup would "
"have copies of the files from different points in time."

"Snapshots in ZFS provide a variety of features that even other file systems "
"with snapshot functionality lack.  A typical example of snapshot use is as a "
"quick way of backing up the current state of the file system when performing "
"a risky action like a software installation or a system upgrade.  If the "
"action fails, rolling back to the snapshot returns the system to the same "
"state when creating the snapshot.  If the upgrade was successful, delete the "
"snapshot to free up space.  Without snapshots, a failed upgrade often "
"requires restoring backups, which is tedious, time consuming, and may "
"require downtime during which the system is unusable.  Rolling back to "
"snapshots is fast, even while the system is running in normal operation, "
"with little or no downtime.  The time savings are enormous with multi-"
"terabyte storage systems considering the time required to copy the data from "
"backup.  Snapshots are not a replacement for a complete backup of a pool, "
"but offer a quick and easy way to store a dataset copy at a specific time."

"More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different.  ZFS combines the "

"to a live system and having the new space available on the existing file "
"systems in that pool at once.  By combining the traditionally separate "
"roles, ZFS is able to overcome previous limitations that prevented RAID "
"groups being able to grow.  A _vdev_ is a top level device in a pool and can "
"be a simple disk or a RAID transformation such as a mirror or RAID-Z array.  "
"ZFS file systems (called _datasets_) each have access to the combined free "

This can be an entire disk (such as [.filename]#/dev/ada0# or [.filename]#/dev/da0#) or a partition ([.filename]#/dev/ada0p3#). On FreeBSD, there is no performance penalty for using a partition rather than the entire disk. This differs from recommendations made by the Solaris documentation.\n"

"[CAUTION]\n"

"* [[zfs-term-vdev-mirror]] _Mirror_ - When creating a mirror, specify the `mirror` keyword followed by the list of member devices for the mirror. A mirror consists of two or more devices, writing all data to all member devices. A mirror vdev will hold as much data as its smallest member. A mirror vdev can withstand the failure of all but one of its members without losing any data.\n"

"* [[zfs-term-vdev-raidz]] _RAID-Z_ - ZFS uses RAID-Z, a variation on standard RAID-5 that offers better distribution of parity and eliminates the \"RAID-5 write hole\" in which the data and parity information become inconsistent after an unexpected restart. ZFS supports three levels of RAID-Z which provide varying levels of redundancy in exchange for decreasing levels of usable storage. ZFS uses RAID-Z1 through RAID-Z3 based on the number of parity devices in the array and the number of disks which can fail before the pool stops  being operational.\n"
"+\n"
"In a RAID-Z1 configuration with four disks, each 1 TB, usable storage is 3 TB and the pool will still be able to operate in degraded mode with one faulted disk. If another disk goes offline before replacing and resilvering the faulted disk would result in losing all pool data.\n"
"+\n"
"In a RAID-Z3 configuration with eight disks of 1 TB, the volume will provide 5 TB of usable space and still be able to operate with three faulted disks. Sun(TM) recommends no more than nine disks in a single vdev. If more disks make up the configuration, the recommendation is to divide them into separate vdevs and stripe the pool data across them.\n"
"+\n"
"A configuration of two RAID-Z2 vdevs consisting of 8 disks each would create something like a RAID-60 array. A RAID-Z group's storage capacity is about the size of the smallest disk multiplied by the number of non-parity disks. Four 1 TB disks in RAID-Z1 has an effective size of about 3 TB, and an array of eight 1 TB disks in RAID-Z3 will yield 5 TB of usable space.\n"
"* [[zfs-term-vdev-spare]] _Spare_ - ZFS has a special pseudo-vdev type for keeping track of available hot spares. Note that installed hot spares are not deployed automatically; manually configure them to replace the failed device using `zfs replace`.\n"
"* [[zfs-term-vdev-log]] _Log_ - ZFS Log Devices, also known as ZFS Intent Log (<<zfs-term-zil,ZIL>>) move the intent log from the regular pool devices to a dedicated device, typically an SSD. Having a dedicated log device improves the performance of applications with a high volume of synchronous writes like databases. Mirroring of log devices is possible, but RAID-Z is not supported. If using a lot of log devices, writes will be load-balanced across them.\n"
"* [[zfs-term-vdev-cache]] _Cache_ - Adding a cache vdev to a pool will add the storage of the cache to the <<zfs-term-l2arc,L2ARC>>. Mirroring cache devices is impossible. Since a cache device stores only new copies of existing data, there is no risk of data loss."

Since allocating space for the data blocks generates new metadata, the syncing state cannot finish until a pass completes that does not use any new space. The syncing state is also where _synctasks_ complete. Synctasks are administrative operations such as creating or destroying snapshots and datasets that complete the uberblock change. Once the sync state completes the transaction group in the quiescing state advances to the syncing state. All administrative functions, such as <<zfs-term-snapshot,`snapshot`>> write as part of the transaction group.

An ARC consists of four lists; the Most Recently Used (MRU) and Most Frequently Used (MFU) objects, plus a ghost list for each. These ghost lists track evicted objects to prevent adding them back to the cache. This increases the cache hit ratio by avoiding objects that have a history of occasional use. Another advantage of using both an MRU and MFU is that scanning an entire file system would evict all data from an MRU or LRU cache in favor of this freshly accessed content. With ZFS, there is also an MFU that tracks the most frequently used objects, and the cache of the most commonly accessed blocks remains."

msgid "L2ARC is the second level of the ZFS caching system. RAM stores the primary ARC. Since the amount of available RAM is often limited, ZFS can also use <<zfs-term-vdev-cache,cache vdevs>>. Solid State Disks (SSDs) are often used as these cache devices due to their higher speed and lower latency compared to traditional spinning disks. L2ARC is entirely optional, but having one will increase read speeds for cached files on the SSD instead of having to read from the regular disks. L2ARC can also speed up <<zfs-term-deduplication,deduplication>> because a deduplication table (DDT) that does not fit in RAM but does fit in the L2ARC will be much faster than a DDT that must read from disk. Limits on the data rate added to the cache devices prevents prematurely wearing out SSDs with extra writes. Until the cache is full (the first block evicted to make room), writes to the L2ARC limit to the sum of the write limit and the boost limit, and afterwards limit to the write limit. A pair of man:sysctl[8] values control these rate limits. <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_max,`vfs.zfs.l2arc_write_max`>> controls the number of bytes written to the cache per second, while <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_boost,`vfs.zfs.l2arc_write_boost`>> adds to this limit during the \"Turbo Warmup Phase\" (Write Boost)."

The snapshot contains the original file system version and the live file system contains any changes made since taking the snapshot using no other space.

A <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,rollback>> of a live file system to a specific snapshot is possible, undoing any changes that took place after taking the snapshot. Each block in the pool has a reference counter which keeps track of the snapshots, clones, datasets, or volumes use that block.

msgid "Checksums make it possible to detect duplicate blocks when writing data. With deduplication, the reference count of an existing, identical block increases, saving storage space. ZFS keeps a deduplication table (DDT) in memory to detect duplicate blocks. The table contains a list of unique checksums, the location of those blocks, and a reference count. When writing new data, ZFS calculates checksums and compares them to the list. When finding a match it uses the existing block. Using the SHA256 checksum algorithm with deduplication provides a secure cryptographic hash. Deduplication is tunable. If `dedup` is `on`, then a matching checksum means that the data is identical. Setting `dedup` to `verify`, ZFS performs a byte-for-byte check on the data ensuring they are actually identical. If the data is not identical, ZFS will note the hash collision and store the two blocks separately. As the DDT must store the hash of each unique block, it consumes a large amount of memory. A general rule of thumb is 5-6 GB of ram per 1 TB of deduplicated data). In situations not practical to have enough RAM to keep the entire DDT in memory, performance will suffer greatly as the DDT must read from disk before writing each new block. Deduplication can use L2ARC to store the DDT, providing a middle ground between fast system memory and slower disks. Consider using compression instead, which often provides nearly as much space savings without the increased memory."

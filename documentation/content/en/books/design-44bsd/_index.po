"media such as disks. 4.4BSD supports several organizations of data on the "

"those of the filesystem, but, once a connection is set up, a process can "

"The _kernel_ is the part of the system that runs in protected mode and "
"mediates access by all user programs to the underlying hardware (e.g., CPU, "
"disks, terminals, network links) and software constructs (e.g., filesystem, "
"network protocols).  The kernel provides the basic system facilities; it "
"creates and manages processes, and provides functions to access the "
"filesystem and communication facilities.  These functions, called _system "
"calls_ appear to user processes as library subroutines.  These system calls "
"are the only interface that processes have to these facilities.  Details of "
"the system-call mechanism are given in Chapter 3, as are descriptions of "
"several kernel mechanisms that do not execute as the direct result of a "
"process doing a system call."

"The 4.4BSD kernel is not partitioned into multiple processes.  This basic "

"could have been implemented as readily as the actually implemented model of "
"kernel and user processes.  The monolithic kernel was chosen for simplicity "
"and performance.  And the early kernels were small; the inclusion of "
"facilities such as networking into the kernel has increased its size.  The "
"current trend in operating-systems research is to reduce the kernel size by "

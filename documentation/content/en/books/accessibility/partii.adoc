The operating system provides two main interfaces for user interaction: Virtual Terminal and several Desktop Environments.

Virtual Terminal, commonly referenced and documented as man:vt[4] is the system's built-in extref:{handbook}ports[virtual console].
It is installed by default, provides a command-line interface, and starts automatically at boot.
Its features relevant to vision accessibility are detailed in the crossref:virtual-terminal[virtual-terminal,Virtual Terminal] chapter.

Desktop environments provide graphical elements, such as windows, menus, buttons, and so on.
They can be installed using extref:{handbook}ports[ports and packages];
refer to Chapters extref:{handbook}x11[X Window System], extref:{handbook}wayland[Wayland], and extref:{handbook}desktop[Desktop Environments] of the FreeBSD Handbook.
This section explains how to install, configure, and use color schemes, themes, and visual accessibility features designed to support users with low vision or blindness in graphical environments.

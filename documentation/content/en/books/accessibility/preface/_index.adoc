[[intended-audience]]
== Intended Audience

This handbook is intended for anyone interested in the assistive technologies available in the FreeBSD operating system.
Users and administrators can learn how to configure the system for accessibility.
Developers will find resources and guidance to help them create, improve, and test accessible software.

[[organization-book]]
== Organization of this Book

This book is organized into sections, chapters, and paragraphs, all of which can be read independently and out of order.
The first section, _crossref:parti[parti-general,Part I. General]_, provides guidance on how to seek help and includes various miscellaneous topics.
The second section, _crossref:partii[partii-vision,Part II. Vision]_, focuses on assistive technologies for visual accessibility;
It is intentionally free of images to maximize accessibility
All sections and chapters are self-contained and can be read in any order.

Chapters:

_crossref:help[help,Help]_::
Explains where and how to seek support within the FreeBSD community.

_crossref:virtual-terminal[virtual-terminal,Virtual Terminal]_::
Highlights features of the system's virtual console for visual accessibility.

_crossref:colors[colors,Colors]_::

_crossref:lowvision[lowvision,Low Vision]_::
Introduces tools and settings for users with low vision.

_crossref:blindness[blindness,Blindness]_::
Covers accessibility tools and configurations for blind users, including screen readers, text-based utilities, and relevant ports.

_crossref:development[development,Development]_::
Offers guidelines and resources for developers to enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments.

[[commands]]
== Commands

FreeBSD offers a powerful command line interface that enables users to execute a wide range of text commands to set up and use the operating system.
This Handbook, like all official FreeBSD documentation, follows these command prompt conventions:

- A command preceded by `%` can be executed by any regular user.
- A command preceded by `#` must be executed by the `root` user (the system administrator).

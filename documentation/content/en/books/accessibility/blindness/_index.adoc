[[blindness-intro]]
== Introduction

This chapter describes assistive technologies for users who are blind, focusing primarily on screen readers and tools designed to work in conjunction with them.
The chapter deliberately contains no images and aims to minimize the use of elements other than plain text.

[[screen-reader]]
== Screen Reader

Currently, screen readers function only within the extref:{handbook}x11[X Window System] and are not supported in the crossref:virtual-terminal[virtual-terminal,Virtual Terminal].
FreeBSD does not currently support Braille displays, so they rely exclusively on speech synthesizers.

[[orca]]
=== Orca

Orca is a widely used and well-known open source screen reader.
It offers a comprehensive set of features and is available on FreeBSD through the package:accessibility/orca[] package.

[[orca-install]]
==== Installation

To install it, execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install orca
....

[[orca-launch]]
==== Launch

Orca can be launched in several ways.
From a terminal, type:

[source,shell]
....
% orca
....

Some desktop environments
(extref:{handbook}desktop/#kde-environment[KDE Plasma],
extref:{handbook}desktop/#xfce-environment[XFCE],
extref:{handbook}desktop/#gnome-environment[GNOME])
provide a keyboard shortcut to launch Orca: `Super` + `Alt` + `s`.

[TIP]
====
The Super key is usually labeled as Windows icon, Command icon, or "Super".
Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_key_(keyboard_button) for more information.
====

[[orca-usage]]
==== Usage

Orca provides a manual page: man:orca[1].
However, most of the documentation is available online.
The main reference is the starting point in the https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/orca/help/[Orca Users Guide], which includes:

 - Getting Started
 - Reading Documents and Web Pages
 - Reviewing and Interacting with Screen Contents

The screen reader includes many keyboard commands for navigation and interaction.
Refer to the https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/orca/help/commands.html[Orca's Commands] page for a full list.

[[orca-config]]
==== Configuration

Orca can be configured through a graphical settings interface. To open it, run:

[source,shell]
....
% orca -s
....

Configuration options are documented on the https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/orca/help/preferences.html[Orca's Preferences Dialogs] page.

[[yasr]]
=== yasr

The package:accessibility/yasr[] utility is a lightweight screen reader that operates exclusively in a terminal environment.
Yasr requires a speech synthesizer to work.
Its default configuration file is set up to use package:accessibility/eflite[].

To install both yasr and eflite, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install yasr eflite
....

To start the screen reader, execute:

[source,shell]
....
% yasr
....

The global configuration file for yasr is located at [.filename]#/usr/local/share/yasr/yasr.conf#.
To create a user-specific configuration file, copy the global one to your home directory:

[source,shell]
....
% cp /usr/local/share/yasr/yasr.conf ~/.yasr.conf
....

For details on configuration options and keyboard shortcuts, refer to man:yasr[1].

[[blindness-ports]]
== Ports Collection

FreeBSD provides the extref:{handbook}ports[Ports Collection], which offers a simple way to install applications.
Some ports allow you to configure options before building and installation.
By default, configuration is handled through a TUI menu not accessible by a screen reader.

The package:ports-mgmt/portoptscli[] utility is a text-only tool specifically designed to configure ports using a screen reader.
To install it, run:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install portoptscli
....

Then add to [.filename]#/etc/make.conf#:

[.programlisting]
....
DIALOG4PORTS=/usr/local/bin/portoptscli
....

From now on, the Ports framework will automatically invoke portoptscli whenever a port offers configurable options.

For detailed information about its features and usage, refer to the manual page man:portoptscli[1] and consult the online https://gitlab.com/alfix/portoptscli/-/raw/main/README.txt[README].

[[blindness-editor]]
== Editor

[[ed]]
=== ed

The man:ed[1] utility is a line-oriented text editor used to create, view, and modify text files.
It is included by default in a standard FreeBSD installation.
To start the editor, run:

[source,shell]
....
% ed
....

ed is a powerful editor.
Refer to its manual page man:ed[1] for a complete overview of its features and command syntax.

[WARNING]
====
ed does not support multibyte characters and may not handle non-ASCII text correctly.
Alternatively, consider using crossref:blindness[edbrowse,edbrowse], which offers robust text editing features in addition to its browsing capabilities.
====

[[blindness-internet-web]]
== Internet and WEB

[[edbrowse]]
=== Edbrowse

Edbrowse is a text-based browser, editor, IRC chat client, and mail client, specifically designed for screen reader users.
Its interface is similar to man:ed[1], but with extended functionality.

[[edbrowse-install]]
==== Installation

To install package:www/edbrowse[], execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install edbrowse
....

[[edbrowse-usage]]
==== Usage

To launch Edbrowse, run:

[source,shell]
....
% edbrowse
....

The first time you run edbrowse, it will not find the configuration file [.filename]#~/.ebrc#.
It will automatically create a default configuration file, display a message, and exit:

[source,shell]
....
% edbrowse
Your edbrowse config file is missing; a default file has been created for you.
Before running edbrowse again, take the time to personalize your config file:
/home/yournickname/.ebrc
edbrowse -c to edit
%
....

You can now relaunch Edbrowse; it will use the default configuration file.
To customize it, either run:

[source,shell]
....
% edbrowse -c
....

Or use your preferred text editor, for example:

[source,shell]
....
% ed ~/.ebrc
....

[TIP]
====
Example configuration files are provided in [.filename]#/usr/local/share/doc/edbrowse/#.
These include:

 - sample.ebrc: with comments in English
 - sample_fr.ebrc: with comments in French
 - sample_it.ebrc: with comments in Italian
====

[[edbrowse-doc]]
==== Documentation

The utility provides a manual page: man:edbrowse[1].
However, the main documentation is available online in the https://edbrowse.org/usersguide.html[User's Guide].

The package also installs a local copy of the documentation at [.filename]#/usr/local/share/doc/edbrowse/usersguide.html#.
To view it using edbrowse, run:

[source,shell]
....
% edbrowse /usr/local/share/doc/edbrowse/usersguide.html
....

Translated versions of the user guide are available in the same directory:

 - usersguide_es.html: Spanish
 - usersguide_fr.html: French
 - usersguide_pt_br.html: Brazilian Portuguese

[[blindness-liblouis]]
== Liblouis

package:devel/liblouis[] is a translator for many languages to and from Braille.
It provides a large number of conversion tables.
To install, execute:

[source,shell]
....
# pkg install liblouis
....

The package installs both libraries and utilities.
The translation utility is man:lou_translate[1].

The following example demonstrates how to transcribe the text `FreeBSD Accessibility Handbook` into Braille with English Grade 2 translation table and the unicode.dis display table.
The final output is Braille encoded as Unicode dot patterns.

[source,shell]
....
% echo "FreeBSD Accessibility Handbook" | lou_translate -f unicode.dis,en-us-g2.ctb
⠠⠋⠗⠑⠑⠠⠠⠃⠎⠙⠀⠠⠁⠒⠑⠎⠎⠊⠃⠊⠇⠰⠽⠀⠠⠓⠯⠃⠕⠕⠅
....

Documentation and additional examples for this utility are available on the project website, specifically in the https://liblouis.io/documentation/liblouis.html#Testing-Translation-Tables-interactively[Testing Translation Tables interactively] section of the official documentation.

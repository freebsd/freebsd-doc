[[help-mailinglists]]
== Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are the primary communication channel for the FreeBSD community, covering a wide range of topics related to the project.
Messages are typically written in plain text without graphical elements, making them well-suited for use with screen readers (both Braille displays and speech synthesizers).
A complete list of available mailing lists can be found at: https://lists.freebsd.org/.

For accessibility issues, the main point of contact is the FreeBSD Accessibility Mailing List.
To subscribe, browse the archive, send messages, or manage your subscription, visit: https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-accessibility

[[help-chat]]
== Chat

FreeBSD users and developers are also active on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), where real-time communication takes place.
A complete list of servers and channels is available at: https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Channels
Messages are typically exchanged in plain text, making IRC well-suited for screen readers (both Braille displays and speech synthesizers).

[[help-ports-pkgs]]
== Ports and Packages

If the issue pertains to an external tool installed through a extref:{handbook}ports[port or package], consider including the port maintainer in the discussion to ensure proper attention and resolution.

To find out who maintains a specific port, navigate to the port's directory and run the command `make maintainer`.
For example, to find the maintainer of the package:www/edbrowse[] port, run:

[source,shell]
....
% cd /usr/ports/www/edbrowse
% make maintainer
....

To find the maintainer of an installed package, use the `pkg info -f _package_`.
For example:

[source,shell]
....
% pkg info -f edbrowse | grep Maintainer | awk '{print $3}'
....

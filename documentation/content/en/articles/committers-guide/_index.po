"Often pull requests are simple: requests that contain only a single commit.  "
"In this case, a streamlined approach may be used, though the approach in the "
"prior section will also work.  Here, a branch is created, the change is "
"cherry picked, the commit message adjusted, and sanity-checked before being "
"pushed.  The branch `staging` is used in this example but it can be any "
"name.  This technique works for any number of commits in the pull request, "
"especially when the changes apply cleanly to the FreeBSD tree.  However, "
"when there's multiple commits, especially when minor adjustments are needed, "
"`git rebase -i` works better than `git cherry-pick`.  Briefly, these "
"commands create a branch; cherry-picks the changes from the pull request; "
"tests it; adjusts the commit messages; and fast forward merges it back to "
"`main`.  The PR number is `$PR` below.  When adjusting the message, add "
"`Pull Request: https://github.com/freebsd-src/pull/$PR`.  All pull requests "
"committed to the FreeBSD repository should be reviewed by at least one "
"person.  This need not be the person committing it, but in that case the "
"person committing it should trust the other reviewers competence to review "
"the commit.  Committers that do a code review of pull requests before "
"pushing them into the repo should add a `Reviewed by:` line to the commit, "
"because in this case it is not implicit.  Add anybody that reviews and "
"approves the commit on github to `Reviewed by:` as well.  As always, care "
"should be taken to ensure the change does what it is supposed to, and that "

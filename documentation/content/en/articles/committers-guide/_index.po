"Often pull requests are simple: requests that contain only a single commit.\n"
"In this case, a streamlined approach may be used, though the approach in the prior section will also work.\n"

"This technique works for any number of commits in the pull request, especially when the changes apply cleanly to the FreeBSD tree.\n"

"It is very important to have a current PGP/GnuPG key in the repository. The key may be required for positive identification of a committer.

"Add an entry for each additional mentor/mentee relationship in the bottom section.\n"
". Generate a Kerberos Password\n"
"+\n"
"See crossref:committers-guide[kerberos-ldap] to generate or set a Kerberos account for use with other FreeBSD services like the link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/[bug-tracking database] (you get a bug-tracking account as part of that step).\n"

"Wiki Information - After gaining access to the wiki, some people add entries to the https://wiki.freebsd.org/HowWeGotHere[How We Got Here], https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Nicknames[IRC Nicks], https://wiki.freebsd.org/Community/Dogs[Dogs of FreeBSD], and or https://wiki.freebsd.org/Community/Cats[Cats of FreeBSD] pages.\n"
". Optional: Update Ports with Personal Information\n"
"+\n"
"[.filename]#ports/astro/xearth/files/freebsd.committers.markers# and [.filename]#src/usr.bin/calendar/calendars/calendar.freebsd# - Some people add entries for themselves to these files to show where they are located or the date of their birthday.\n"
". Optional: Prevent Duplicate Mailings\n"

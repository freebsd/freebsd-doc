"The development of FreeBSD is a very open process.  FreeBSD is comprised of "
"contributions from thousands of people around the world.  The FreeBSD "
"Project provides Subversion footnote:[Subversion, http://"
"subversion.apache.org] access to the general public so that others can have "
"access to log messages, diffs (patches) between development branches, and "
"other productivity enhancements that formal source code management "
"provides.  This has been a huge help in attracting more talented developers "
"to FreeBSD.  However, I think everyone would agree that chaos would soon "
"manifest if write access to the main repository was opened up to everyone on "
"the Internet.  Therefore only a \"select\" group of nearly 300 people are "
"given write access to the Subversion repository.  These extref:{contributors}"

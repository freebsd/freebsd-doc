"No matter the type of disks, there are always potential problems.  The disks "
"can be too small, too slow, or too unreliable to meet the system's "
"requirements.  While disks are getting bigger, so are data storage "
"requirements.  Often a file system is needed that is bigger than a disk's "
"capacity.  Various solutions to these problems have been proposed and "

"Modern systems frequently need to access data in a highly concurrent "

"Current disk drives can transfer data sequentially at up to 70 MB/s, but "
"this value is of little importance in an environment where many independent "
"processes access a drive, and where they may achieve only a fraction of "
"these values.  In such cases, it is more interesting to view the problem "
"from the viewpoint of the disk subsystem.  The important parameter is the "
"load that a transfer places on the subsystem, or the time for which a "
"transfer occupies the drives involved in the transfer."

"In any disk transfer, the drive must first position the heads, wait for the "

"[[vinum-latency]] Consider a typical transfer of about 10 kB: the current "
"generation of high-performance disks can position the heads in an average of "
"3.5 ms.  The fastest drives spin at 15,000 rpm, so the average rotational "
"latency (half a revolution) is 2 ms.  At 70 MB/s, the transfer itself takes "
"about 150 μs, almost nothing compared to the positioning time.  In such a "
"case, the effective transfer rate drops to a little over 1 MB/s and is "
"clearly highly dependent on the transfer size."

"The traditional and obvious solution to this bottleneck is \"more "
"spindles\": rather than using one large disk, use several smaller disks with "

"factor close to the number of disks used."

"The evenness of the load on the disks is strongly dependent on the way the "
"data is shared across the drives.  In the following discussion, it is "
"convenient to think of the disk storage as a large number of data sectors "
"which are addressable by number, rather like the pages in a book.  The most "
"obvious method is to divide the virtual disk into groups of consecutive "
"sectors the size of the individual physical disks and store them in this "
"manner, rather like taking a large book and tearing it into smaller "
"sections.  This method is called _concatenation_ and has the advantage that "
"the disks are not required to have any specific size relationships.  It "
"works well when the access to the virtual disk is spread evenly about its "
"address space.  When access is concentrated on a smaller area, the "
"improvement is less marked.  crossref:vinum[vinum-concat, Concatenated "

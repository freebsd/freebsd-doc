"This masters thesis deals with updating the Linux(R) emulation layer (the so "
"called _Linuxulator_).  The task was to update the layer to match the "
"functionality of Linux(R) 2.6.  As a reference implementation, the Linux(R) "
"2.6.16 kernel was chosen.  The concept is loosely based on the NetBSD "
"implementation.  Most of the work was done in the summer of 2006 as a part "
"of the Google Summer of Code students program.  The focus was on bringing "
"the _NPTL_ (new POSIX(R) thread library) support into the emulation layer, "
"including _TLS_ (thread local storage), _futexes_ (fast user space mutexes), "
"_PID mangling_, and some other minor things.  Many small problems were "
"identified and fixed in the process.  My work was integrated into the main "
"FreeBSD source repository and will be shipped in the upcoming 7.0R release.  "
"We, the emulation development team, are working on making the Linux(R) 2.6 "
"emulation the default emulation layer in FreeBSD."

"In the last few years the open source UNIX(R) based operating systems "

"for its wide user base, enthusiastic open developer community and support "

"UNIX(R) is an operating system with a long history that has influenced "
"almost every other operating system currently in use.  Starting in the "
"1960s, its development continues to this day (although in different "
"projects).  UNIX(R) development soon forked into two main ways: the BSDs and "
"System III/V families.  They mutually influenced themselves by growing a "
"common UNIX(R) standard.  Among the contributions originated in BSD we can "
"name virtual memory, TCP/IP networking, FFS, and many others.  The System V "
"branch contributed to SysV interprocess communication primitives, copy-on-"
"write, etc.  UNIX(R) itself does not exist any more but its ideas have been "
"used by many other operating systems world wide thus forming the so called "
"UNIX(R)-like operating systems.  These days the most influential ones are "
"Linux(R), Solaris, and possibly (to some extent) FreeBSD.  There are in-"
"company UNIX(R) derivatives (AIX, HP-UX etc.), but these have been more and "
"more migrated to the aforementioned systems.  Let us summarize typical "
"UNIX(R) characteristics."

"The FreeBSD kernel has been made preemptive basically to deal with interrupt "
"threads.  In fact, to avoid high interrupt latency, time-sharing priority "
"threads can be preempted by interrupt threads (in this way, they do not need "
"to wait to be scheduled as the normal path previews).  Preemption, however, "
"introduces new racing points that need to be handled, as well.  Often, to "
"deal with preemption, the simplest thing to do is to completely disable it.  "
"A critical section defines a piece of code (borderlined by the pair of "
"functions man:critical_enter[9] and man:critical_exit[9], where preemption "
"is guaranteed to not happen (until the protected code is fully executed).  "
"This can often replace a lock effectively but should be used carefully to "
"not lose the whole advantage that preemption brings."

"Threads in computer science are entities within a process that can be "
"scheduled independently from each other.  The threads in the process share "
"process wide data (file descriptors, etc.) but also have their own stack for "
"their own data.  Sometimes there is a need for process-wide data specific to "
"a given thread.  Imagine a name of the thread in execution or something like "
"that.  The traditional UNIX(R) threading API, pthreads provides a way to do "
"it via man:pthread_key_create[3], man:pthread_setspecific[3] and man:"
"pthread_getspecific[3] where a thread can create a key to the thread local "
"data and using man:pthread_getspecific[3] or man:pthread_getspecific[3] to "
"manipulate those data.  You can easily see that this is not the most "
"comfortable way this could be accomplished.  So various producers of C/C++ "
"compilers introduced a better way.  They defined a new modifier keyword "
"thread that specifies that a variable is thread specific.  A new method of "
"accessing such variables was developed as well (at least on i386).  The "
"pthreads method tends to be implemented in userspace as a trivial lookup "
"table.  The performance of such a solution is not very good.  So the new "
"method uses (on i386) segment registers to address a segment, where TLS area "
"is stored so the actual accessing of a thread variable is just appending the "
"segment register to the address thus addressing via it.  The segment "
"registers are usually `%gs` and `%fs` acting like segment selectors.  Every "
"thread has its own area where the thread local data are stored and the "
"segment must be loaded on every context switch.  This method is very fast "
"and used almost exclusively in the whole i386 UNIX(R) world.  Both FreeBSD "
"and Linux(R) implement this approach and it yields very good results.  The "
"only drawback is the need to reload the segment on every context switch "
"which can slowdown context switches.  FreeBSD tries to avoid this overhead "
"by using only 1 segment descriptor for this while Linux(R) uses 3.  "
"Interesting thing is that almost nothing uses more than 1 descriptor (only "
"Wine seems to use 2) so Linux(R) pays this unnecessary price for context "
"switches."

"The ioctl interface is quite fragile due to its generality.  We have to bear "

"implemented in [.filename]#linux_ioctl.c#, where `linux_ioctl` function is "
"defined.  This function simply iterates over sets of ioctl handlers to find "
"a handler that implements a given command.  The ioctl syscall has three "
"parameters, the file descriptor, command and an argument.  The command is a "
"16-bit number, which in theory is divided into high 8 bits determining class "
"of the ioctl command and low 8 bits, which are the actual command within the "
"given set.  The emulation takes advantage of this division.  We implement "
"handlers for each set, like `sound_handler` or `disk_handler`.  Each handler "
"has a maximum command and a minimum command defined, which is used for "
"determining what handler is used.  There are slight problems with this "
"approach because Linux(R) does not use the set division consistently so "
"sometimes ioctls for a different set are inside a set they should not belong "
"to (SCSI generic ioctls inside cdrom set, etc.).  FreeBSD currently does not "
"implement many Linux(R) ioctls (compared to NetBSD, for example) but the "

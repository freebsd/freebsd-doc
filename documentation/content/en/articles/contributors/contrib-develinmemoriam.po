"Mike Karels, originally a microbiology Ph.D. degree candidate at University "
"of California Berkeley (UCB), expressed interest in computers in a nearby "
"lab which led him to change his entire career path.  He eventually became "
"involved in the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UCB in the early "
"1980's.  Once there, his contributions were instrumental in the development "
"and improvement of the BSD Unix TCP/UDP/IP implementation, including the "
"socket interface API, one of the most widely used application programming "
"interfaces in the history of the Internet."

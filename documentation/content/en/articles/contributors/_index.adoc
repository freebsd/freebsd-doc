[NOTE]
====
As of 2010, the following section is several years out-of-date. Donations from the past several years appear https://www.FreeBSD.org/donations/donors/[here].
====

The FreeBSD Project is indebted to the following donors and would like to publicly thank them here!

* _Contributors to the central server project:_
+
The following individuals and businesses made it possible for the FreeBSD Project to build a new central server machine, which has replaced `freefall.FreeBSD.org` at one point, by donating the following items:

** Ulf Zimmermann <mailto:ulf@Alameda.net[ulf@Alameda.net]> of http://www.Alameda.net/[Alameda Networks] donated _128MB of memory_, a _4 Gb disk drive and the case._

* _Direct funding:_
+
The following individuals and businesses have generously contributed direct funding to the project:

** Annelise Anderson <mailto:ANDRSN@HOOVER.STANFORD.EDU[ANDRSN@HOOVER.STANFORD.EDU]>
** {dillon}

** Kenneth P. Stox <mailto:ken@stox.sa.enteract.com[ken@stox.sa.enteract.com]> of http://www.imagescape.com/[Imaginary Landscape, LLC.]
** Dmitry S. Kohmanyuk <mailto:dk@dog.farm.org[dk@dog.farm.org]>
** http://www.cdrom.co.jp/[Laser5] of Japan (a portion of the profits from sales of their various FreeBSD CDROMs).
** http://www.mmjp.or.jp/fuki/[Fuki Shuppan Publishing Co.] donated a portion of their profits from _Hajimete no FreeBSD_ (FreeBSD, Getting started) to the FreeBSD and XFree86 projects.
** http://www.ascii.co.jp/[ASCII Corp.] donated a portion of their profits from several FreeBSD-related books to the FreeBSD project.
** http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/[Yokogawa Electric Corp] has generously donated significant funding to the FreeBSD project.
** http://www.buffnet.net/[BuffNET]
** http://www.pacificsolutions.com/[Pacific Solutions]
** http://www.siemens.de/[Siemens AG] via Andre Albsmeier <mailto:andre.albsmeier@mchp.siemens.de[andre.albsmeier@mchp.siemens.de]>
** Chris Silva <mailto:ras@interaccess.com[ras@interaccess.com]>

* _Hardware contributors:_
+
The following individuals and businesses have generously contributed hardware for testing and device driver development/support:

** BSDi for providing the Pentium P5-90 and 486/DX2-66 EISA/VL systems that are being used for our development work, to say nothing of the network access and other donations of hardware resources.
** http://www.compaq.com[Compaq] has donated a variety of Alpha systems to the FreeBSD Project. Among the many generous donations are 4 AlphaStation DS10s, an AlphaServer DS20, AlphaServer 2100s, an AlphaServer 4100, 8 500Mhz Personal Workstations, 4 433Mhz Personal Workstations, and more! These machines are used for release engineering, package building, SMP development, and general development on the Alpha architecture.
** TRW Financial Systems, Inc. provided 130 PCs, three 68 GB file servers, twelve Ethernets, two routers and an ATM switch for debugging the diskless code.
** Dermot McDonnell donated the Toshiba XM3401B CDROM drive currently used in freefall.
** Chuck Robey <mailto:chuckr@glue.umd.edu[chuckr@glue.umd.edu]> contributed his floppy tape streamer for experimental work.
** Larry Altneu <mailto:larry@ALR.COM[larry@ALR.COM],> and {wilko}, provided Wangtek and Archive QIC-02 tape drives in order to improve the [.filename]#wt# driver.
** Ernst Winter (http://berklix.org/ewinter/[Deceased]) contributed a 2.88 MB floppy drive to the project. This will hopefully increase the pressure for rewriting the floppy disk driver.
** http://www.tekram.com/[Tekram Technologies] sent one each of their DC-390, DC-390U and DC-390F FAST and ULTRA SCSI host adapter cards for regression testing of the NCR and AMD drivers with their cards. They are also to be applauded for making driver sources for free operating systems available from their FTP server link:ftp://ftp.tekram.com/scsi/FreeBSD/[ftp://ftp.tekram.com/scsi/FreeBSD/].
** Larry M. Augustin contributed not only a Symbios Sym8751S SCSI card, but also a set of data books, including one about the forthcoming Sym53c895 chip with Ultra-2 and LVD support, and the latest programming manual with information on how to safely use the advanced features of the latest Symbios SCSI chips. Thanks a lot!
** {kuku} donated an FX120 12 speed Mitsumi CDROM drive for IDE CDROM driver development.
** Mike Tancsa <mailto:mike@sentex.ca[mike@sentex.ca]> donated four various ATM PCI cards in order to help increase support of these cards as well as help support the development effort of the netatm ATM stack.

* _Special contributors:_

** http://www.osd.bsdi.com/[BSDi] (formerly Walnut Creek CDROM) has donated almost more than we can say (see the 'About the FreeBSD Project' section of the extref:{handbook}[FreeBSD Handbook] for more details). In particular, we would like to thank them for the original hardware used for `freefall.FreeBSD.org`, our primary development machine, and for `thud.FreeBSD.org`, a testing and build box. We are also indebted to them for funding various contributors over the years and providing us with unrestricted use of their T1 connection to the Internet.
** The http://www.interface-business.de/[interface business GmbH, Dresden] has been patiently supporting {joerg} who has often preferred FreeBSD work over paid work, and used to fall back to their (quite expensive) EUnet Internet connection whenever his private connection became too slow or flaky to work with it...
** http://www.bsdi.com/[Berkeley Software Design, Inc.] has contributed their DOS emulator code to the remaining BSD world, which is used in the _doscmd_ command.

[[contrib-derived]]
== Derived Software Contributors

This software was originally derived from William F. Jolitz's 386BSD release 0.1, though almost none of the original 386BSD specific code remains.
This software has been essentially re-implemented from the 4.4BSD-Lite release provided by the Computer Science Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley and associated academic contributors.

There are also portions of NetBSD and OpenBSD that have been integrated into FreeBSD as well, and we would therefore like to thank all the contributors to NetBSD and OpenBSD for their work.

[[contrib-additional]]
== Additional FreeBSD Contributors

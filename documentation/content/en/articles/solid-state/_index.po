"The scope of this article will be limited to solid state disk devices made "
"from flash memory.  Flash memory is a solid state memory (no moving parts) "
"that is non-volatile (the memory maintains data even after all power sources "
"have been disconnected).  Flash memory can withstand tremendous physical "
"shock and is reasonably fast (the flash memory solutions covered in this "
"article are slightly slower than a EIDE hard disk for write operations, and "
"much faster for read operations).  One very important aspect of flash "
"memory, the ramifications of which will be discussed later in this article, "
"is that each sector has a limited rewrite capacity.  You can only write, "
"erase, and write again to a sector of flash memory a certain number of times "
"before the sector becomes permanently unusable.  Although many flash memory "
"products automatically map bad blocks, and although some even distribute "
"write operations evenly throughout the unit, the fact remains that there "
"exists a limit to the amount of writing that can be done to the device.  "
"Competitive units have between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 writes per sector in "
"their specification.  This figure varies due to the temperature of the "
"environment."

"Specifically, we will be discussing ATA compatible compact-flash units, "
"which are quite popular as storage media for digital cameras.  Of particular "
"interest is the fact that they pin out directly to the IDE bus and are "
"compatible with the ATA command set.  Therefore, with a very simple and low-"
"cost adaptor, these devices can be attached directly to an IDE bus in a "
"computer.  Once implemented in this manner, operating systems such as "
"FreeBSD see the device as a normal hard disk (albeit small)."

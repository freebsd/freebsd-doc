"The easiest way to handle leap seconds is with the POSIX time rules FreeBSD "
"uses by default, combined with extref:{handbook}network-servers[NTP, network-"
"ntp].  When man:ntpd[8] is running and the time is synchronized with "
"upstream NTP servers that handle leap seconds correctly, the leap second "
"will cause the system time to automatically repeat the last second of the "
"day.  No other adjustments are necessary."

"If the upstream NTP servers do not handle leap seconds correctly, "

"Leap seconds are inserted at the same instant all over the world: UTC "

"previous ones."

"However, we caution that practically no applications have ever asked the "
"kernel about leap seconds.  Our experience is that, as designed, leap "
"seconds are essentially a replay of the second before the leap second, and "
"this is a surprise to most application programmers."

msgid ""
"The Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library is a generalized API for "
"authentication-related services which allows a system administrator to add "
"new authentication methods simply by installing new PAM modules, and to "
"modify authentication policies by editing configuration files."

msgid ""
"PAM was defined and developed in 1995 by Vipin Samar and Charlie Lai of Sun "
"Microsystems, and has not changed much since.  In 1997, the Open Group "
"published the X/Open Single Sign-on (XSSO) preliminary specification, which "
"standardized the PAM API and added extensions for single (or rather "
"integrated) sign-on.  At the time of this writing, this specification has "
"not yet been adopted as a standard."

"The terminology surrounding PAM is rather confused.  Neither Samar and Lai's "
"original paper nor the XSSO specification made any attempt at formally "
"defining terms for the various actors and entities involved in PAM, and the "
"terms that they do use (but do not define) are sometimes misleading and "
"ambiguous.  The first attempt at establishing a consistent and unambiguous "
"terminology was a whitepaper written by Andrew G. Morgan (author of Linux-"
"PAM) in 1999.  While Morgan's choice of terminology was a huge leap forward, "
"it is in this author's opinion by no means perfect.  What follows is an "
"attempt, heavily inspired by Morgan, to define precise and unambiguous terms "
"for all actors and entities involved in PAM."

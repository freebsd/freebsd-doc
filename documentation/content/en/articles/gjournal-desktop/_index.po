"A journaling file system uses a log to record all transactions that take "
"place in the file system, and preserves its integrity in the event of a "
"system crash or power failure.  Although it is still possible to lose "
"unsaved changes to files, journaling almost completely eliminates the "
"possibility of file system corruption caused by an unclean shutdown.  It "
"also shortens to a minimum the time required for after-failure file system "
"checking.  Although the UFS file system employed by FreeBSD does not "
"implement journaling itself, the new journal class of the GEOM framework in "
"FreeBSD 7._X_ can be used to provide file system independent journaling.  "
"This article explains how to implement UFS journaling on a typical desktop "
"PC scenario."

"While professional servers are usually well protected from unforeseen "

Abstract

This article describes building an internal FreeBSD Update Server. The https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/freebsd-update-build/[freebsd-update-server] is written by `{cperciva}`, Security Officer Emeritus of FreeBSD. For users that think it is convenient to update their systems against an official update server, building their own FreeBSD Update Server may help to extend its functionality by supporting manually-tweaked FreeBSD releases or by providing a local mirror that will allow faster updates for a number of machines.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Experienced users or administrators are often responsible for several machines or environments. They understand the difficult demands and challenges of maintaining such an infrastructure. Running a FreeBSD Update Server makes it easier to deploy security and software patches to selected test machines before rolling them out to production. It also means a number of systems can be updated from the local network rather than a potentially slower Internet connection. This article outlines the steps involved in creating an internal FreeBSD Update Server.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To build an internal FreeBSD Update Server some requirements should be met.

* A running FreeBSD system.
+
[NOTE]
====
At a minimum, updates require building on a FreeBSD release greater than or equal to the target release version for distribution.
====
* A user account with at least 4 GB of available space. This will allow the creation of updates for 7.1 and 7.2, but the exact space requirements may change from version to version.
* An man:ssh[1] account on a remote machine to upload distributed updates.
* A web server, like link:{handbook}#network-apache[Apache], with over half of the space required for the build. For instance, test builds for 7.1 and 7.2 consume a total amount of 4 GB, and the webserver space needed to distribute these updates is 2.6 GB.
* Basic knowledge of shell scripting with Bourne shell, man:sh[1].

[[Configuration]]
== Configuration: Installation & Setup

Download the https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/freebsd-update-build/[freebsd-update-server] software by installing package:devel/subversion[] and package:security/ca_root_nss[], and execute:

[source,bash]
....
% svn co https://svn.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/freebsd-update-build freebsd-update-server
....

Update [.filename]#scripts/build.conf# appropriately. It is sourced during all build operations.

Here is the default [.filename]#build.conf#, which should be modified to suit your environment.

[.programlisting]
....
# Main configuration file for FreeBSD Update builds.  The
# release-specific configuration data is lower down in
# the scripts tree.

# Location from which to fetch releases
export FTP=ftp://ftp2.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases <.>

# Host platform
export HOSTPLATFORM=`uname -m`

# Host name to use inside jails
export BUILDHOSTNAME=${HOSTPLATFORM}-builder.daemonology.net <.>

# Location of SSH key
export SSHKEY=/root/.ssh/id_dsa <.>

# SSH account into which files are uploaded
MASTERACCT=builder@wadham.daemonology.net <.>

# Directory into which files are uploaded
MASTERDIR=update-master.freebsd.org <.>
....

Parameters for consideration would be:

<.> This is the location where ISO images are downloaded from (by the `fetchiso()` subroutine of [.filename]#scripts/build.subr#). The location configured is not limited to FTP URIs. Any URI scheme supported by standard man:fetch[1] utility should work fine.
Customizations to the `fetchiso()` code can be installed by copying the default [.filename]#build.subr# script to the release and architecture-specific area at [.filename]#scripts/RELEASE/ARCHITECTURE/build.subr# and applying local changes.

<.> The name of the build host. This information will be displayed on updated systems when issuing:
+
[source,bash]
....
% uname -v
....
+
<.> The SSH key for uploading files to the update server. A key pair can be created by typing `ssh-keygen -t dsa`. This parameter is optional; standard password authentication will be used as a fallback authentication method when `SSHKEY` is not defined.
The man:ssh-keygen[1] manual page has more detailed information about SSH and the appropriate steps for creating and using one.

<.> Account for uploading files to the update server.

<.> Directory on the update server where files are uploaded to.

The default [.filename]#build.conf# shipped with the freebsd-update-server sources is suitable for building i386 releases of FreeBSD. As an example of building an update server for other architectures, the following steps outline the configuration changes needed for amd64:

[.procedure]
====
. Create a build environment for amd64:
+
[source,bash]
....
% mkdir -p /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/scripts/7.2-RELEASE/amd64
....

. Install a [.filename]#build.conf# in the newly created build directory. The build configuration options for FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE on amd64 should be similar to:
+
[.programlisting]
....
# SHA256 hash of RELEASE disc1.iso image.
export RELH=1ea1f6f652d7c5f5eab7ef9f8edbed50cb664b08ed761850f95f48e86cc71ef5 <.>
# Components of the world, source, and kernels
export WORLDPARTS="base catpages dict doc games info manpages proflibs lib32"
export SOURCEPARTS="base bin contrib crypto etc games gnu include krb5  \
                lib libexec release rescue sbin secure share sys tools  \
                ubin usbin cddl"
export KERNELPARTS="generic"

# EOL date
export EOL=1275289200 <.>
....
+
<.> The man:sha256[1] hash key for the desired release, is published within the respective link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[release announcement].
<.> To generate the "End of Life" number for [.filename]#build.conf#, refer to the "Estimated EOL" posted on the link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/security/[FreeBSD Security Website]. The value of `EOL` can be derived from the date listed on the web site, using the man:date[1] utility, for example:
+
[source,bash]
....
% date -j -f '%Y%m%d-%H%M%S' '20090401-000000' '+%s'
....
====

[[build]]
== Building Update Code

The first step is to run [.filename]#scripts/make.sh#. This will build some binaries, create directories, and generate an RSA signing key used for approving builds. In this step, a passphrase will have to be supplied for the final creation of the signing key.

[source,bash]
....
# sh scripts/make.sh
cc -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe   findstamps.c  -o findstamps
findstamps.c: In function 'usage':
findstamps.c:45: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit'
cc -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe   unstamp.c  -o unstamp
install findstamps ../bin
install unstamp ../bin
rm -f findstamps unstamp
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
................................................................................++

27ef53e48dc869eea6c3136091cc6ab8589f967559824779e855d58a2294de9e

Encrypting signing key for root

Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
....

[NOTE]
====
Keep a note of the generated key fingerprint. This value is required in [.filename]#/etc/freebsd-update.conf# for binary updates.
====

At this point, we are ready to stage a build.

[source,bash]
....
# cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server
# sh scripts/init.sh amd64 7.2-RELEASE
....

What follows is a sample of an _initial_ build run.

Then the build of the world is performed again, with world patches. A more detailed explanation may be found in [.filename]#scripts/build.subr#.

[WARNING]
====

During this second build cycle, the network time protocol daemon, man:ntpd[8], is turned off. Per `{cperciva}`, Security Officer Emeritus of FreeBSD, "the https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/freebsd-update-build/[freebsd-update-server] build code needs to identify timestamps which are stored in files so that they can be ignored when comparing builds to determine which files need to be updated. This timestamp-finding works by doing two builds 400 days apart and comparing the results."

....

Approve the build if everything is correct. More information on determining this can be found in the distributed source file named [.filename]#USAGE#. Execute [.filename]#scripts/approve.sh#, as directed. This will sign the release, and move components into a staging area suitable for uploading.

[source,bash]

....

After the approval process is complete, the upload procedure may be started.

[source,bash]
....
# cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server
# sh scripts/upload.sh amd64 7.2-RELEASE
....

[NOTE]
====
In the event update code needs to be re-uploaded, this may be done by changing to the public distributions directory for the target release and updating attributes of the _uploaded_ file.

[source,bash]
....
# cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/pub/7.2-RELEASE/amd64
# touch -t 200801010101.01 uploaded
....

====

The uploaded files will need to be in the document root of the webserver in order for updates to be distributed. The exact configuration will vary depending on the web server used. For the Apache web server, please refer to the link:{handbook}#network-apache[Configuration of Apache servers] section in the Handbook.

Update client's `KeyPrint` and `ServerName` in [.filename]#/etc/freebsd-update.conf#, and perform updates as instructed in the link:{handbook}#updating-upgrading-freebsdupdate[FreeBSD Update] section of the Handbook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order for FreeBSD Update Server to work properly, updates for both the _current_ release and the release _one wants to upgrade to_ need to be built. This is necessary for determining the differences of files between releases. For example, when upgrading a FreeBSD system from 7.1-RELEASE to 7.2-RELEASE, updates will need to be built and uploaded to your distribution server for both versions.
====

For reference, the entire run of link:../../source/articles/freebsd-update-server/init.txt[init.sh] is attached.

[[patch]]
== Building a Patch

Every time a link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/advisories/[security advisory] or link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/notices/[security notice] is announced, a patch update can be built.

For this example, 7.1-RELEASE will be used.

A couple of assumptions are made for a different release build:

* Setup the correct directory structure for the initial build.
* Perform an initial build for 7.1-RELEASE.

Create the patch directory of the respective release under [.filename]#/usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/#.

[source,bash]
....
% mkdir -p /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE/
% cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE
....

As an example, take the patch for man:named[8]. Read the advisory, and grab the necessary file from link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/advisories/[FreeBSD Security Advisories]. More information on interpreting the advisory, can be found in the link:{handbook}#security-advisories[FreeBSD Handbook].

In the https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09:12.bind.asc[security brief], this advisory is called `SA-09:12.bind`. After downloading the file, it is required to rename the file to an appropriate patch level. It is suggested to keep this consistent with official FreeBSD patch levels, but its name may be freely chosen. For this build, let us follow the currently established practice of FreeBSD and call this `p7`. Rename the file:

[source,bash]
....
% cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server/patches/7.1-RELEASE/; mv bind.patch 7-SA-09:12.bind
....

[NOTE]
====
When running a patch level build, it is assumed that previous patches are in place. When a patch build is run, it will run all patches contained in the patch directory.

There can be custom patches added to any build. Use the number zero, or any other number.
====

[WARNING]
====

It is up to the administrator of the FreeBSD Update Server to take appropriate measures to verify the authenticity of every patch.
====

At this point, a _diff_ is ready to be built. The software checks first to see if a [.filename]#scripts/init.sh# has been run on the respective release prior to running the diff build.

[source,bash]
....
# cd /usr/local/freebsd-update-server
# sh scripts/diff.sh amd64 7.1-RELEASE 7
....

What follows is a sample of a _differential_ build run.

[source,bash]
....

[[tips]]
== Tips

* If a custom release is built using the native `make release` link:{releng}#release-build[procedure], freebsd-update-server code will work from your release. As an example, a release without ports or documentation can be built by clearing functionality pertaining to documentation subroutines `findextradocs ()`, `addextradocs ()` and altering the download location in `fetchiso ()`, respectively, in [.filename]#scripts/build.subr#. As a last step, change the man:sha256[1] hash in [.filename]#build.conf# under your respective release and architecture and you are ready to build off your custom release.
+
[.programlisting]
....
# Compare ${WORKDIR}/release and ${WORKDIR}/$1, identify which parts
# of the world|doc subcomponent are missing from the latter, and
# build a tarball out of them.
findextradocs () {
}
# Add extra docs to ${WORKDIR}/$1
addextradocs () { 
}
....

* Adding `-j _NUMBER_` flags to `buildworld` and `obj` targets in the [.filename]#scripts/build.subr# script may speed up processing depending on the hardware used, however it is not necessary. Using these flags in other targets is not recommended, as it may cause the build to become unreliable.
+
[.programlisting]
....
              # Build the world
		   log "Building world"
		   cd /usr/src &&
		   make -j 2 ${COMPATFLAGS} buildworld 2>&1
		# Distribute the world
		   log "Distributing world"
		   cd /usr/src/release &&
		   make -j 2 obj &&
		   make ${COMPATFLAGS} release.1 release.2 2>&1
....

* Create an appropriate link:{handbook}#network-dns[DNS] SRV record for the update server, and put others behind it with variable weights. Using this facility will provide update mirrors, however this tip is not necessary unless you wish to provide a redundant service.

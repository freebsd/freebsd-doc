"Experienced users or administrators are often responsible for several "
"machines or environments.  They understand the difficult demands and "
"challenges of maintaining such an infrastructure.  Running a FreeBSD Update "
"Server makes it easier to deploy security and software patches to selected "
"test machines before rolling them out to production.  It also means a number "
"of systems can be updated from the local network rather than a potentially "
"slower Internet connection.  This article outlines the steps involved in "
"creating an internal FreeBSD Update Server."

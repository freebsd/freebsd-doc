"Some license identifiers, like [L]GPL, have the option to use only that "
"version, or any later version.  SPDX defines the suffix `-or-later` to mean "
"that version of the license or a later version.  It defines `-only` to mean "
"only that specific version of the file.  There is an old convention to have "
"no suffix (which means what the new '-only' suffix means, but which people "
"confuse for `-or-later`).  In addition, affixing a `+` suffix was meant to "
"mean `-or-later`.  New files in FreeBSD should not use these two "
"conventions.  Old files that use this convention should be converted as "
"appropriate."

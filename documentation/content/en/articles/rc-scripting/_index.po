"The historical BSD had a monolithic startup script, [.filename]#/etc/rc#.  "
"It was invoked by man:init[8] at system boot time and performed all userland "
"tasks required for multi-user operation: checking and mounting file systems, "
"setting up the network, starting daemons, and so on.  The precise list of "
"tasks was not the same in every system; admins needed to customize it.  With "
"few exceptions, [.filename]#/etc/rc# had to be modified, and true hackers "
"liked it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/articles/rc-scripting/_index.adoc:67
msgid ""
"The real problem with the monolithic approach was that it provided no "
"control over the individual components started from [.filename]#/etc/rc#.  "
"For instance, [.filename]#/etc/rc# could not restart a single daemon.  The "
"system admin had to find the daemon process by hand, kill it, wait until it "
"actually exited, then browse through [.filename]#/etc/rc# for the flags, and "
"finally type the full command line to start the daemon again.  The task "
"would become even more difficult and prone to errors if the service to "
"restart consisted of more than one daemon or demanded additional actions.  "
"In a few words, the single script failed to fulfil what scripts are for: to "
"make the system admin's life easier."

"Later there was an attempt to split out some parts of [.filename]#/etc/rc# "
"for the sake of starting the most important subsystems separately.  The "
"notorious example was [.filename]#/etc/netstart# to bring up networking.  It "
"did allow for accessing the network from single-user mode, but it did not "
"integrate well into the automatic startup process because parts of its code "
"needed to interleave with actions essentially unrelated to networking.  That "
"was why [.filename]#/etc/netstart# mutated into [.filename]#/etc/"
"rc.network#.  The latter was no longer an ordinary script; it comprised of "
"large, tangled man:sh[1] functions called from [.filename]#/etc/rc# at "
"different stages of system startup.  However, as the startup tasks grew "
"diverse and sophisticated, the \"quasi-modular\" approach became even more "
"of a drag than the monolithic [.filename]#/etc/rc# had been."

"Without a clean and well-designed framework, the startup scripts had to bend "
"over backwards to satisfy the needs of rapidly developing BSD-based "
"operating systems.  It became obvious at last that more steps are necessary "
"on the way to a fine-grained and extensible [.filename]#rc# system.  Thus "
"BSD [.filename]#rc.d# was born.  Its acknowledged fathers were Luke Mewburn "
"and the NetBSD community.  Later it was imported into FreeBSD.  Its name "
"refers to the location of system scripts for individual services, which is "
"in [.filename]#/etc/rc.d#.  Soon we will learn about more components of the "
"[.filename]#rc.d# system and see how the individual scripts are invoked."

"The basic ideas behind BSD [.filename]#rc.d# are _fine modularity_ and "
"__code reuse__.  _Fine modularity_ means that each basic \"service\" such as "
"a system daemon or primitive startup task gets its own man:sh[1] script able "
"to start the service, stop it, reload it, check its status.  A particular "
"action is chosen by the command-line argument to the script.  The "
"[.filename]#/etc/rc# script still drives system startup, but now it merely "
"invokes the smaller scripts one by one with the `start` argument.  It is "
"easy to perform shutdown tasks as well by running the same set of scripts "
"with the `stop` argument, which is done by [.filename]#/etc/rc.shutdown#.  "
"Note how closely this follows the Unix way of having a set of small "
"specialized tools, each fulfilling its task as well as possible.  _Code "
"reuse_ means that common operations are implemented as man:sh[1] functions "
"and collected in [.filename]#/etc/rc.subr#.  Now a typical script can be "
"just a few lines' worth of man:sh[1] code.  Finally, an important part of "
"the [.filename]#rc.d# framework is man:rcorder[8], which helps [.filename]#/"
"etc/rc# to run the small scripts orderly with respect to dependencies "
"between them.  It can help [.filename]#/etc/rc.shutdown#, too, because the "
"proper order for the shutdown sequence is opposite to that of startup."

"The services dummy and dummy_foo can be managed independently of each other, "

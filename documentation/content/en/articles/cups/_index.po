"CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) as the basis for managing "
"print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon (LPD), Server Message Block "
"(SMB), and AppSocket (aka JetDirect) protocols are also supported with "
"reduced functionality.  CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript "
"Printer Description (PPD) based printing options to support real-world "
"printing under UNIX(R).  As a result, CUPS is ideally-suited for sharing and "
"accessing printers in mixed environments of FreeBSD, Linux(R), Mac OS(R) X, "
"or Windows(R)."

"Difficulties with CUPS often lies in permissions.  First, double check the "

"to make sure your user is a member of the `cups` group.  If the permissions "
"check boxes in the Administration section of the CUPS web interface do not "
"seem to be working, another fix might be to manually backup the main CUPS "
"configuration file located at [.filename]#/usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf# "
"and edit the various configuration options and try different combinations of "
"configuration options.  One sample [.filename]#/usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd."
"conf# to test is listed below.  Please note that this sample [."
"filename]#cupsd.conf# sacrifices security for easier configuration; once the "
"administrator successfully connects to the CUPS server and configures the "
"clients, it is advisable to revisit this configuration file and begin "

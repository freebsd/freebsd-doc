<!-- 
     Creates entities for each .txt screenshot that is included in the 
     Handbook.

     Each entity is named txt.dir.foo, where dir is the directory in
     which it is stored, and foo is its filename, without the '.txt' 
     extension.

     Entities should be listed in alphabetical order.

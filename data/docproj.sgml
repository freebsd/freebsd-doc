    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>Unix has frequently, and rightfully so, been criticized
      for being difficult to learn.  While the tool based
      approach to a computing system is powerful, users are often
      stymied by the terse style of the manual pages that
      describe each tool in detail but rarely provide hints about
      how, when or why the tool can be used in day to day
      operations.  Many excellent books have been written to show
      the tools in a context and a number are highly recommended
      for anyone using FreeBSD.  However, since every Unix system
      has its own quirks, a number of gaps exist in the
      documentation as a whole.</p>

    <p>The mission of the FreeBSD Documentation Project is to
      fill this documentation gap.  Specifically:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To cover features, procedures, and other quirks that
	are unique to FreeBSD and thus not to be found in
	commonly available Unix user, administrator and
	programmer guides available on the market. The most
	important of these are:<p></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Installation<p></p></li>
	  <li>Hardware support and troubleshooting<p></p></li>
	  <li>System configuration and tuning<p></p></li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>To provide documentation covering the most commonly
	used aspects of FreeBSD, whether or not the topics are
	covered in other user, administrator and programmer
	guides.  This includes topics such as:<p></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Network configuration and troubleshooting<p></p></li>
	  <li>ISP services<p></p></li>
	  <li>General system administration<p></p></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>To realize the above goals, the Documentation Project is
      focused on two specific pieces of documentation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href = "FAQ/FAQ.html">The
	  FAQ</a></li>
      <li><a href = "handbook/handbook.html">The
	  FreeBSD Handbook</a></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The goal of the <a href =
      "FAQ/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> is to address in a
      short question and answer format the most common questions
      that are asked, or <em>should be</em> asked on the various
      mailing lists and newsgroups devoted to the discussion of
      FreeBSD.  The format does not permit long winded and
      comprehensive answers.</p>

    <p>Topics that need a more in depth discussion than the FAQ
      can provide are addressed in the <a href =
      "handbook/handbook.html">FreeBSD Handbook</a>.
      The current incarnation of the handbook is largely a
      skeletal framework with many empty chapters and sections
      waiting to be filled by words of wisdom.</p>

    <h2>Contributing to the project</h2>

    <p>Like the rest of the FreeBSD project, the documentation
      project depends on the tireless contributions of users.  To
      facilitate the project, a mailing list has been created for
      the discussion of documentation issues and communication
      among authors.  Anyone wishing to contribute to materials
      or editorial time should subscribe by sending mail to <a
      href="mailto:majordomo@freebsd.org">majordomo@freebsd.org</a>
      with a message body of:</p>

    <blockquote>subscribe freebsd-doc</blockquote>

    <p>(See <a href="handbook/eresources:mail.html">Mailing
      lists</a> in the handbook for complete information on the
      FreeBSD mailing lists.)</p>

    <p>We welcome both corrections and additions to existing
      documentation as well as submissions of entirely new
      sections.  All documents should reflect the state of
      FreeBSD 2.0.5R unless there is a compelling reason to cover
      a different release.  In such a case, the version to which
      the information applies must be clearly stated.</p>

    <h3>Submitting corrections</h3>

    <p>When providing corrections or additions to existing
      documentation, the preferred method is <em>context
      diff</em> relative to the text as it appears in
      FreeBSD-current.  (see the <code>diff(1)</code> manual page
      for details on generating a context diff).  The
      FreeBSD-current text for the handbook can be found in:</p>

    <blockquote><a
href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/doc/handbook">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/doc/handbook</a></blockquote>

    <p>while the FAQ can be found at:</p>

    <blockquote><a
href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/doc/FAQ">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/doc/FAQ</a></blockquote>

    <p>Diffs should be directed to <a
	href="mailto:doc@freebsd.org">doc@freebsd.org</a> for
	review.</p>

    <h3>Submitting new material</h3>

    <p>If you can claim expertise on some topic of interest to
      other FreeBSD users and the topic is not covered by either
      the FAQ or the Handbook, we would love to incorporate your
      wisdom into one or the other.  If you wish to contribute
      but are not sure what is needed, have a good look through
      the <a href="handbook/handbook.html">handbook</a> and the
      <a href="FAQ/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and see what
      <em>you</em> think is missing.  In particular, the handbook
      has a fairly complete outline but sections marked with an
      asterisk (*) are currently empty and waiting for an eager
      author.</p>

    <p>At this time, the preferred format for submitting new
      materials is SGML conforming to the linuxdoc DTD.  The DTD
      and tools for converting appropriately tagged documents
      into LaTeX, HTML and ascii text are available in FreeBSD
      2.1 and -current.  See the <code>sgmlfmt(1)</code> manual
      page for details.  Due to shortcomings of the linuxdoc DTD,
      the project hopes to move to a more flexible DTD such as
      DocBook in the future.  Any changes will be announced on
      the freebsd-doc <a
      href="handbook/eresources:mail.html">mailing
      list</a>.</p>

    <p>If you do not feel comfortable with SGML, the next best
      format is LaTeX because it can be converted to SGML with a
      minimum of hassle.  Failing that, plain ASCII submissions
      are always welcome.</p>

    <p>Some general editorial guidelines:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do not use contractions.<p></p></li>

      <li>Provide concrete examples.<p></p></li>

      <li>Use cross references.  In the HTML version of the
	document, these become hypertext links.<p></p></li>

      <li>Do not duplicate other sections of the document, even
	if they have yet to be written.  If you feel the existing
	section provides insufficient information to support your
	topic, think about whether the additional information
	should go in the section you are writing, or if it should
	be added to the other end of the cross reference.
	Contact the author of the referenced section if you
	suspect the latter.<p></p></li>

    </ul>
